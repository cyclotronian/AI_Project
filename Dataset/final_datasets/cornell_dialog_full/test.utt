No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
The "real you".
Did you change your hair?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Where've you been?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
But she doesn't want to date.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
That girl -- I --
You know French?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Assail your ears for one night.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
What's this?
What'd he say?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I say, do what you wanna do.
Why?
Kat! Wake up!
I should do this.
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Good call.
You up for it?
Is that a request or a command?
No, I won't go with you
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Macbeth, right?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
You're completely demented.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
I want to go with you!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
... and also to bring medicine.
God... That's in a week!
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
What are you saying?
How long?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Where can I meet this man?
...delusions and paranoia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Now I become custody of police department?
What about back home?
Do you have coffee?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
What was that, Korfin?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Only one guys checked in?
Are you hit?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You goin' to the escort service?
I'm serious here.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Is it drug related?
Alright.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Did you hear what I said?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Traitor!!
Well, he...
I speak English.
What was that?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
CONTINUED
Okay. 
I guess not.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Well, don't worry about it.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.

CONINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
When are you coming home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
That's true
I understand.
Name?
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
I hear you've got visitors.
Yeah, I noticed...
Yeah?
Bullshit.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Just tell me about the money.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
What?
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Yeah, I see her.
Why?
It's late, they're closing...
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
How did they get away?
That's what you say, Cates...
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Billy Bear...
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
What am I wanted for?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How ya doin'?
We got a lot to talk about.
You chickenshit punk...
How about some ammo?
How much?
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
What's she doing?
Where's Leeloo?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I don't need one.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
The Fifth Element...
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I'm sorry..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
I'm not going.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
You hear that?
Love...
Finished what?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
The cash man!
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
What happened to you?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What are these?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Friend of yours?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Alright, Tom.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
You... you need to go to the police.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Okay...
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Are you religious?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
Yes... I remember Mary
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Okay, I'll take it all.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Alice, you think you can leave?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Then you saw him, too?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
How long have you been awake?
I'm sorry honey, but...
I'll tell you later.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Mommy...?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
You disappointed in me?
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
What's that got to do with it?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Vomit?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What is it?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Yeah?
Well?
Dave - !
Is there any way out of it?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Excuse me, Skipper---
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
All ready?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
See what?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
He's on to us!
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door. We're late.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Pop?
How you holding up, Wade?
The key, Wade.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Good. Who?
How's she doing?
You okay?
I'm sorry.
Call me.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Going somewhere, Margie?
It makes me sad.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
It don't look right.
Just do it.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Where's Ma?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Yeah.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere. 
I don't know. You tell me.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
But they start executing hostages in
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
And all these rooms here?
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
How did your speech go?
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Did they say anything about my family?
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Where's my family?
who can I say is calling?
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You give me ulcers.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Dunn.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted!  What are you...?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Captain Oveur?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Hi!
Excuse me, Sister?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
You are Cassandra?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
William Harcourt?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
What's this?  What's going on?
Get the picture?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Who said that?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Where'd you get this?!!
Well, let's roll, George.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
How do I look?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, I heard of it.
What kind of test?
This floor's freezing.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Ripley...
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Still nothing from the colony?
I told them to fall back...
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Well you're not reading it right!
Now many?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
It's game time.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
Fifteen meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
So what do I tell this guy?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Gone.
Burke!  Open the door!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Oh!
Why?
No, she's fine.
Hardly.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Why not?
Yes.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Yes, my love?
Come back tonight.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Papa, is this your idea?
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Where does he work?
Is he working?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Sssh!
Yes.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What for?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I'm sorry. No.
Love, Sire!
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Do you have a daughter?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
You mean she's not coming back?
Would you? Actually, you could.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Do you want to rest a bit?
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly. A dance.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
No, but I'm the best.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
What do you want?
So?
What do you want?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
What?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Where?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
Go about your duties.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Could you get here without any trouble?
Aw come on, Alex!
You're a very beautiful girl.
I was. What are you reading?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
The kitchen.
The bedroom.
But, David.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
How long have I been here?
Two weeks?
There were witnesses?
You're talking about the woman I love.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Go on, ask them.
Beware the moon?
Come on, where?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Shut up, you zombie!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, are you really dead?
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
No, thank you, Doctor.
What's that?
Then you have some hot tea?
Oh.
Where's Matt?
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Thanks.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
Well, what?
Why are you so anxious?
What?
Why, Cyril, you're insane
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Oh!
Yes?
Helen!
Got my letter?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
No. I won't.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Why pick on him ?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh, Matt . . .
What did you find out, Mike?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
How are you fixed?
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
We got a problem here, brother?
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Web's dead.
Hell of a war.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Not if I find the right girl.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Little ones.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
We're moving you tomorrow.
Yes?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Now let's have a drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
... too young for whisky...
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
There's only four of them...
Parker.
That.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Yes?
I know. Stop it.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Luis is a despicable twit.
It's a plain end. I think.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
He's rich.
No, no, no.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
SHUT UP!
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
We are totally booked.
I said we are totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
After six.
Yes?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Patrick? Is that you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Don't tell him you're here.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Coffee?
Would you rather I not smoke?
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
So was I.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Shhhh...it's okay.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
You think so?
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What!
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Okay.
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
'Think I should buy some originals?
Milo. What's up?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Every entry was authorized.
You calling Phil and Randy?
...Were you?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Cool!
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
He's out of prison?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
I don't know --
Why were you so careless?
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Why?!
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Bring it to the other location.
Latitude 47 degrees.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Come in.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Do I make you horny?
I can't see a bloody thing.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Oh, yes you are.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Everything seems to be in order.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
Ow! You shot me!
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Quite impressive.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
I just don't see it.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... death ...
Flower ...
Secret ...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Such as?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
And I suppose you're the knight.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Strange.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Is that what you think?
I thought you played by the rules.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Privately owned by ...
Oh, hello ...
Think she really killed those agents?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
I was hoping you could tell me.
In your operation.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
You're better than I expected.
What's happening?
What do you mean?
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
And...
Cole...
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I don't want any trouble.
Hello?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Let go of me!
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
It's true.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Rick, I'm concerned.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
Been ripping off fire stations?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Ya love it, probie?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
Anything else?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Hi.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
Who the fuck is doing this?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Did I say thanks?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Do you have to do that?
What?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
-- Burn them.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
So what are you doing here?
I forgive you.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I want 15 on the Mets.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Keep trying.
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
No offense.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
Nice to meet you.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
That ain't funny.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
Yep, you guessed it.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
How was it?
I'm in till the end.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
We both lied to him.
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
So you have your small victory, now what?
How so?
You feel good, not nervous?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
You know how your Daddy is.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
How did you get this gig?
Let Myrna finish.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
...perfect...
...like macaroni and cheese...
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
What else?
Maybe you need to start.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
O'Grady.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I believe they will deport you.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Not one.
How so?
Will we always leave it at this?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Papa?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Yeah, if you've slept.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
And he'd been shot.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Jesus, what happened?
So you killed him?
Right?
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
Nevertheless --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You think you could explain all this to me?
I'm sorry, Bill.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Is Dunbar cute?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
That was kid gloves?
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
We're fucked, I know --
What?
No bodies, no West...
That's not true.
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
Pike and I got separated --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
But you didn't see it, right?
It won't work --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
What happens to Dunbar now?
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
What is this place?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Can I see him?
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Well, she... uh...
It's okay, just leave it.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You owe me three-fifty.
Did I ever tell you about how...
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
The river.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Where are we headed?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Mom?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Do you like it?
What?
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hello.
Yes. I know.
No.
You must have a visa or something...
Tell me.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
Is that everything?
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Syevodnya?
"Frenzy".
They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What?
Fine.
I don't want to talk about it.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I wasn't saying anything.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I don't know.
Why?
My name's Sophia.
You have excellent English.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Angela?
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
When? Now? Oh. No.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Teh... Tehronne?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Where's Ronnie?
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
I just wanted some make-up.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
What's this?
What are they doing now?
Who do you think the Jap is?
Frank Abolofia.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This should be it...
Joyce can be nice.
Where do we start looking for this guy?
What's he saying?
Yakuza.
Nick --
Where does this Sugai live?
Thank you.  You have one?
You all right?
Louder, pal, louder.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
If I say no?
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I want more life, fucker.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
You're our best and only friend.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
When might that be?
Vodka!
Those cockroaches?
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
My job is here.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
They could clean around the arrangement.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Is this to be an empathy test?
May I ask a personal question?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
You want to go home?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Twenty.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Bravo!
How do you do?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Nope.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
How's that?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
...Okay.
What's fair?
Thank you.
Then forget it.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
They're all divorced?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
I was wrong!!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
He has a computer?
In the house?
May I please be excused?
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
What?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I know first aid!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
...I do.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
...the pipe tobacco.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
You have very nice ceilings.
Not particularly.
No.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
Sure.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Elbows, Son.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
All back East.
It's time.
No.  They all do.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
If we still have one.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
We stay down here.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I see "elegant."
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
To bed?
Where did he get all that information?
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Oh, no!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
Buy it from me?
Tower, say again!!
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
You're all through with this now?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Not yet.
Yes? What is it?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Then don't talk about killing.
Look.
Falling.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
Shut up.
What?
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
On a ride.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
What time are visiting hours?
Would you like a piece of cake?
No, you're right.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
How is Central these days?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
Are you alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So, what's next?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
What's with Mike?
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey? Why?
You didn't tell him about me?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What did he bring him in for?
Yes sir.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Anybody you think is evil?
What? What is it?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Nervous?
Oh, we're good man.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Give the guy a shot.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
What are you serious?
Roc. You okay?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Liberating isn't it?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hello? You there?
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Don't do this my son.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
He's a nigger.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
OK. That's wrong.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
Where are you going?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Yes, they are.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Where was I?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What do you think?
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
You're all clear.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Where?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
That's a sharp jacket.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
That was a test?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
We're renegades from despair.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Could you grow cinnamon?
You think he got my license plates?
Why not?
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Were you born in Mexico?
What?  What?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Wait. Did he see us?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Did we get it?
Way to go, Bob!
Bob. Are you coming?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Yes, I do.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Come on in. What you been up to?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
That's OK.
Scarecrow?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Is he breathing?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do you have your own cell?
We're closed, sir.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You a good pool player.
How's the weather down there?
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
And what are we looking for?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
She say what time I should call?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
That's not what happened to your parents.
You know I'm not.
Because you're afraid!
I emptied it.
Front. Use your teeth.
Try again.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
But we were so careful.
So...
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Switch! You drive!
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
A Russian?
And you got to him before we could.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Show me.
This is everything? Is there.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Amnesia?
Believed what?
Did you?
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Young Robert, we are honored --
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What news of the north?
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
Thank you for accepting.
I've missed you.
Peace is made is such ways.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
What?
Anything.
Why? What for?
We're gonna be late again.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Not since we were kids.
So how's Tommy?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Because you're... different.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Oh? There's proof now?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
So what's the point?
Can... can... Can I have this?
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
Meant no offense.
Shut up, Tommy!
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
How long have you been married?
Monsieur Rick, I --
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Here you are.
You haven't heard my offer.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Yes, of course, we --
That's too far ahead to plan.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
But why my name, Richard?
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Yes?
Did he give any reason?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Well, this might come in handy.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
No. It's all arranged.
My bill.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Manages what?
This is the end of the chase.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
You're late.
Will I see you tonight?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Are my eyes really brown?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Boss!
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
What are you doing?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
No.  that was the last one.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
"We're" not over-reacting.
That's your dog.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I got married.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
You're fucking dead!
To Wilson.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
Digital laser readers.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Oh...
So. Not bored yet?
And what did she die of, exactly?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
There! You said it was boring.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
I thought they might take me.
I just wanted to ask you...
So. What should I do now?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
There was no visible wound?
I don't think so.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Let's just slow down for a second...
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
So we go to the bar.
Who's that?
Jake...
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Minus one.
How much?
Stake you?
Excuse me?
Come here. Feel this.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Oh Jesus!
What about... The money?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Everyone's working an angle, right?
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What happened?
Speak.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
The Indian rope-trick.
How about fifteen hundred?
She went back to South Africa.
All right. As what?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I get it.
Good night?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You're shaking. What is it?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
No.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
I owe a lot of money.
They mean it.
I'm sorry.
Did you solve your problems?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
She's my baby.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Hey Jack, join us.
Rough day?
Where did you go to school?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
Ever?
Girlfriend?
You can start Monday week.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Thanks.
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb...
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Negative effect.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Oh, yeah?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
What?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Lemme put some clothes on.
Where'd you clip this?
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
I was expecting someone else.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
What do you want?
I think you should go now.
Thank you.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Morning, Sunshine...
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Catch you back at the wall.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Does this person have a name?
A toy?
What happens if you level with her?
She was the one--
Okay, okay, okay--
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
You love him?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Jeremiah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Namely?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Whoa... she just farted.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Sunday, but...
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
I think we should try sneaking in.
Cool.
I got...
Oh, hi, mom.
Ahh, sunshine.
No.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
But we took the keys?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
That's alright... I understand.
Hey.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Know what?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Grandma Death.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
You're my only son...
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
What is her name?
Do you think a lot about girls?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Why would I tell Mom?
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
What?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
How did this happen?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
What is this shit?
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
What is wrong with you?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Bye mom.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi...
Hi.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
We was robbed.
I'm a mirror.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
That bitch from...
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Lester?
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
That's enough!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
This is -- what?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Hey you!!
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
One or two?
Yes.
This man belongs in hospital.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Don't we?
How are you feeling today?
You never mentioned his mental state.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
You alright?
What's this?
Yes.
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
...Yes potatoes... but...
The hospital?
Who are they of?
The children! May I see?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Yes sir.  What's that?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Erik. You don't understand.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Is it night or day, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Is there nothing men can do?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
No... we don't...
Would you like us to sing to you?
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Why should you care?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Slower! In... Out...
What are YOU doing here?
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
You must help us.
That's better.
A magic dishcloth.
What's the matter with them?
I AM one, Dad!
She hasn't got any.
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Shut up!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Well I'M certainly not, either.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
You weren't supposed to see that.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
May I help you?
Ms. Kruczynski?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Really? Because --
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
You're sure? It's cold.
Where do you live?
I'm not a stalker.
No. I --
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Probably.
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Hi, it's Joel.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
How's it going?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
That's me.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
She's so sexy.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
So you don't mind?
Definitely!
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
I don't know! I just said that!
He's coming?
I swear.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Okay, we're back in.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I tried that already.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
It's an apartment.
But I don't know how to polka.
Is everything getting worse?
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
Where are the others?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Tell me about it.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What do you think?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
I can see why they sent you along.
Time to play Spam in the can.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
The containment, Second Containment...
It's holding... She's holding...!
Coffee.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Please... kill...
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
90 over 50 and falling... .
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What, Justin, what shows you?
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
What does it say?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
It's 2041...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
Your eyes...
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Captain Miller...
Thank you.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Miller...
You've got to listen...
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What?
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
Those yours too?
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
You look like an eighties rock band.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
The shields on the station should protect us.
Are you alright?
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
No more cracks about how I look.
And where do we think we're going?
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Stop it.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
For science.
What are you doing?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
It's just business.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Victor, your scar --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
You're a really good kisser.
Hey, Mike?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Did you get her number?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Did you go home and get it?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Poor guy.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're losing it, Damone.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
How long does Doug take?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I want romance.
Where's Doug?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Thanks for picking me up.
I don't know.
Are you ready to order here?
Anything to drink?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
...and we're chock full of that!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Shoot it.
That's good...
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I have to go.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
Like big lizards.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Stop it.
Oh!
Ohhh.
We're better off.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What is this?
How much you got to see the show?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
What do you mean what?
Is it gassed up?
Keys.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Bullshit.
What?!
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
OH JESUS!
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Hold it!
Her name is Charlie.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Oh. I mean, good.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Hello, Harold.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
You learn your lines?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Harry!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
...I see.
What do I do, Dad?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
...So what do you think?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Kurt!
Oh, Kurt!
Age?
Address?
Why... yes.
Harry.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
What?
Oh no...
Is that why you did it?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
What for?
Take a walk, pal.
Where are we, mean man?
I should've known...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Yeah.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
'But how do I know you love me?'
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
What?
Say you promise.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Mama, shut up!
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
...Did you really say that?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
You're an outcast.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Why... her?
What is this?
You will honor your promise to me!
Nothing. Still nothing.
I should go. I should leave today.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
It's going to ram us.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
No. But someday.
Professor?
Do you really think I'm mad?
Only you would think of that!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Philosophical?
What is your name?
Preposterous.
Electricity.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Re-configure the leads?
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
How is it you come to be here?
Creature? A... human like creature?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
The killer is still out there.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
How come you're leaving?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
How come?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Holy shit...
Ow!
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
How about our last jay?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Mmmmmmmph?
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
What's this guy's problem?
Yes.
She's dead?
You're a preacher?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't like it, did ya?
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
What did you call me?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
What's this stuff?
I'm going for 'em!
Mexico.
What did I say?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
He says you were scratching.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Do they have a waterbed?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Where's the woman?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Richard!
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Of course, but there's more --
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
See me, sir?
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Yes?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Should probably ask him that.
Then I suggest we start there.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
That bad?
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
'Cool?
Say again, sir?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Got it.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
I like that image.
Don't you think we have enough?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
And you think this creature is one of them?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Circuits are overloaded.
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
What the hell are you doing?
Wish me luck!
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not for a long time, now.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need you to trust me.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Hello?
I understand.
This is it?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
"The show must go on."
God, what an ass.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
What?  What?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
A boy comes to the door.
Oh my god, It's real.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes but, we were wondering-
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
What do you mean?
But you don't?
Shit! Go!
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
... What does that mean?
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
As good as Hopkins?
You Okay, Alex?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
More to the left... Stay parallel...
What?
It's Jason...
There's nobody here. Jason...
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
Explain -
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
You... You mean Earth?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
What's going on?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Hold course, Laredo!
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Well, what have you thought?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
How old are you, Captain?
I'm so inclined.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Makes you gag.
A grand scheme?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
These supplies...?
Like flowers after the snow melts.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
A horseshoer?
General Greene?
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Then why are you teaching me...?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
Yes!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
What about him?
And that's for the airport.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
One of his best parts.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
The door from the patio, in back.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You don't act like it?
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
He already knew it.
Hm?
Hello, Doris.
I don't have a dog.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
How about now?
Let's not be too hasty.
You think that's funny
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Maybe that is his boat.
Try Wednesday.
If you get it back in one piece.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Or somebody stopped them.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Dodge to Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Morning everybody.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Coffee.
Any dizziness?
You okay?
What?
What'd you find up there?
He needs a doctor.
The ah... the radio's out.
What, like some kind of ghost?
What happened.
They went crazy.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
I must be in the wrong business.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Greer?
No, no. You got leak.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Maxine.
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
What?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Aren't there a million places like this?
What do you mean "why"?
Yeah, right...
When did I say I hated you?
God, what a bunch of retards...
Shut up!
Did you sign up yet?
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
So what should we do?
Hey - why do you have this?
What are you talking about -- who?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You call.
What does it stand for?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I want to "make love" to him.
Do you think he knows?
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
What? How long have you been standing there?
What was that all about?
How about this one?
Give me all your money, bitch!
That guy is totally amazing.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Do you want to do something tonight?
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
I dunno...
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
You still interested in that?
Punk rock is over!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Is this one any good?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
So is that your boyfriend?
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
It's not hopeless...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Boo!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
I... I don't think so.
No, of course not.
What's the matter?
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I agree.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Talk to us about it...
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Why would she be hiding from me?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
You were contracted to work-
Let me see the sick.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Have you got it?
Think about something else.
Goddammit!
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Good luck.
How many do you think they've killed?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Janosz?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What are you working on, Egon?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Maybe I should call Janine.
Sorry!
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
You've got to do something!
These boys aren't playing around.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Can I have some of your water?
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
And now you're going to eat it?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Does it have any favorites?
Now that's one ugly dude.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Tell him about the toaster.
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
You're the best one in your row.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
But why?  The students love us!
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
What's that got to do with it?
In the physical sense.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
And may I see this storage facility?
May I please see the storage facility?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Who?
You talked to Gozer?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
For what purpose?
How was your date?
So do I.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
I've read of it.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Serious stuff...
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
How much money is involved?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Where we going?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Why aren't you ready?
No -- don't cry --
I want to ask you a question.
I said I think it is.
Why?
You really will?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Ben!
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Well here's the purse.
Hello.
Did you get a room?
Give me an hour.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Sir?
How are you, Benjamin?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Sit down, Benjamin.
What do you think?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Thank you.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
How are you?
He didn't see me.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to get it now?
I got a single room.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Oh -- yes. Wood?
On your first time --
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
There isn't any.
What do you say to him?
Always?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
I don't believe you.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Why did you say that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
They don't know?
I'm just --
Have you thought about graduate school?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
What?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
You miss the point.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Turn 'em up.
No --
He must be very nice.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Too bad.
What?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
I'd given you up.
Why?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
And then --?
Strange man...
What can you see?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
You do believe that I really love you?
Thank you, sir.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Any letters?
Oh -- but -- I --
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
A man might what?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Am I!
Moreover...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Of course -- of course. 
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
No water -- What a place!
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Yes --
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
What's the matter with you?
Hi, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
You wanna talk to me straight up?
You're calling the shots.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Not much time.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
What's up?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
What happened to your hand?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Going somewhere?
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
Well, uh...
There's nothing more to talk about.
I can't. I just left home.
The tap. What you do for a living.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Yeah?
You were gone for a while.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Don't I get any say in this?
What is it? What's going on?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Ate the gun. Oh.
That's that, then.
Mr. Simms.
Carter.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Another historical inaccuracy.
No shit?!
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
Where are you going?
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Now you're joking, right?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
You really think Eddie killed her?
It's John, isn't it?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Wait.
I have to pee.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
God, what's wrong with him?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
A bitch.
You know what gets me?
How short the skirts are.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Could have happened to anybody.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
You never played a violin.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Play?
What kind of exercise?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
This is crazy.
How do you do?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
What's that all about?
Your old beau?
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Fish can't feel.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Unless she has nerve.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I mean it!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
It died for your sins.
There's a certain amount of information there.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
Hands and knees, you say?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
The new hero is you.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Don't shoot.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Who's dead?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Don't touch me.
I know.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
I don't really know.
I hate that thing.
What?
I don't get it.
What was it?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
You know each other?
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
You want a tip?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Yeah.
You making a feature?
You don't drink?
You know what I'm talking about.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
They were here?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
They are the same.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Why do you say that?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Hello?
In G.R.? Why?
Do the police want to arrest me?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Where'd you hear that name?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What is it, Jake?
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Who told you about this?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
I thought you were a businessman.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't know.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Because if you are...
I don't know.
Yes.
But this is my car.
Sort of.
All right.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
It goes on and on.
That's a nice teapot.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Why do you say that?
What?
What were you fighting for?
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
You are the wisest person I know.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Look at the stars.
It looks like you. Thanks.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Supper for two.
Mother.
And why is that?
No.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Why?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
You knew?
She's done it.
I... I had a visitor.
No bad dreams.
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I'm scared.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Got tired of me?
Well, you did break out --
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
That voice --
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
-- should go back. Now!
Yup.
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
You better have that looked at.
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
What about you?
Yes, I --
Oh.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Nobody escapes us.
Just in time.
Please listen to me --
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Well?
Later.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
So where's the harm?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe we should just leave --
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Kirsty? It's very late.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Is it deep?
You're NOT going to faint.
Are you all right?
I suppose that's right.
Is this your place ?
What's going on?
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
What did you say?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Are you O.K.?
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
I have to talk to you.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
I'm afraid it's true.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Where are you going?
What do we do if there isn't?
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I'll come back later, huh?
Do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nice, Barry.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
Why would they care?
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
My band.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
The little skate-fuckers.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Well what about the new Echo --
What?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Who are you going to see?
What are you talking about?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Huh?
What's this?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
What needs sorting out?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What?
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Will you call me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Do you want me to be there?
What do you mean?
What do you want to do?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Hi.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Just local, of course.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
So?
Enough, Liz.
So you live in Chicago now?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
The Conformist.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
But you must have --
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
We're not there yet, Justin.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Grave robbers?
You have an active imagination.
He called you "MacLeod".
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
What's all that?
Maybe it would do us both good.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I didn't kill the watchman.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
All fashionably without heads.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
-Et lux perpetua-
Be quiet.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
He told me there could be only one.
I don't understand.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
Aye.
Why?
Impotent cow.
I'm your future husband, remember?
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Some think not.
No doubt.
Your name?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
My father taught me.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Are you sure?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How did you find me?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
He found us even there.
Long time.
This your present address?
Did you know the victim?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
You're a kind man to be sure.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
The resemblance is amazing.
What doing?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
But --
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Did you finish the interview?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Oh, she was here.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Mother? But your mother --
Just for the first year.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Get out!
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Then what does he want with you?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Hildy!
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Where'd you wire him?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
How much?
I don't know --
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Boy, did you see her go?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
I'll call.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Gus, this --
Take your paws off me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Pure politics!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Kings and sixes.
Hiding him where?
Mother!
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
What good'll it do?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Are you all right, now?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
The door was locked.
Only till they get you into the local school.
It's true.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I did see them. I did.
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
What's that?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
Except the servicemen.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
What is it, pet?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Drink up, it's party time.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Wondering what?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Yeah.
Really fucking awesome.
Keep straight on this road here.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
It's a hitchhiker.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Hey, he moved.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
What are you doing!
And...
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
What are you laughing at?
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
What was that?
A couple hours!
Recover any bodies?
What'd ya got there?
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Grampa... watch the language.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Turn up this road.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
I guess not.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
You decide. Today is your day.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
What is wrong, my darling?
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
No.
Very well.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
My brother is discreet.
Yeah?
No. I married a midget.
Oh?
How'd you know where I was?
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
It looks wonderful.
I'm sorry?
You do?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Shaving cream?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
That's great. It's a great color for you.
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Bravo to you, Puff!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Puff, put the gun down.
I'm ready.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
I want to talk to you.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
Are you ready for another?
Could be.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Make it twenty.
I'm buyin'.
Poker's not your game.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
That's your problem.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Man named Turk Baker?
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Fine.
What's the matter? What happened?
They're fine.
Please don't get off me now.
Fifty per cent?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
The expensive kind.
Why?
Is this all we got left?
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Yeah. You must come again.
How much you playin' for?
Okay, friend. You're on.
Yours.
Yeah? What do you do now?
What do you do on the other days?
Fifth of scotch?
Why did you do that?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Where you been all day?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
You got it all in your head?
Eddie, what's in that case?
Give it back to me.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Well, he owns things.
What is it, Eddie?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Is that a fact?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
Are you all right?
What about... now?
Do you remember where it is?
Why don't you start with me?
Hell of a night.
So, what do you do?
We're going to be moving, son.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
What's that, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
Where's your car?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Is that all he said?
Mr. Gardner, I --
Where, Jimmy?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
They'll get us.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
When?
Just my luck, no ice.
Are you all right?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What're you talking about?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
You punched the President in the face?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
Pops, you're a genius!
Thanks, Pops.
Get us out of here!
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You scared the hell out of me.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
I don't need it.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
They let you out?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
What the hell's going on?
Yes.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Ah, Venice...
That doesn't look much like a library.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Tapestries?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
I usually don't either.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
How did you get here?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
It's important!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
I'll never forgive myself --
Found it.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Dad!
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
What does that mean?
What did you find, Junior?
Who are you?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Who?
That was a misunderstanding.
You understand what he tells us?
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
What'd he say?
Don't let it curl around you!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
I get it!
I said something.
Try me.
Do me a favor, Al.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
I know...it sounds insane.
Of course you do!
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
What about money?
I can't do that.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Eating sushi?
Holy shit!
Eat it?
It's sand.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Wait.
Where is she staying?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Yeah. I did it.
I feel like an idiot.
Even Rene?
What do I do?
One of your instincts?
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Left...The one with the red dot.
Holy...
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Do something.
Be quiet.
Never mind that, where are we now.
I have been... I think you're right.
She is beautiful.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
No!
I'm against it.
I'm...scared.
I didn't do anything.
You have nothing...
We'll have to let them go.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
We're here.
Joe.
Take the card.
Al?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Sue who?
You may you find all the solitude you want.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Oh...and who is it!?
Blake said that?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why did you leave?
Why?
Who did?
We're very close.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
What?
How?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What did you tell them?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Don't worry.
Just like that?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
What could you find in this place?
Is there anything else?
This the only spare?
The other working.
Ow?...
It will.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
It'l take months.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Where?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
When's your deadline?
Are you all right?
I don't know what he was thinking.
Alright, alright.
Do you want more rice?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
You ready...?
Lowell?
What do you need at the store?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Use the bathroom.
Yeah.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
Jeffrey Wigand...
Yeah...
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
We're there.
Yeah, that's right.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Coffee?
Should I just take the documents now?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Lowell, I can't afford --
ABC Telemarketing Company.
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What are you talking about?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
No!
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
So who'd you hire?
Is Tong older than Ming?
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
I don't have a ring!
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Miles? You're scaring me.
I don't believe you have "things."
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
You were going to have this thug...?
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Forgery and Fraud?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Wow.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Herb wants to see me?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
And it's good!
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Hi, Sweetie.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
Mr. Warne?
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
You only met him once .
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well!
Fine man to fall in love with.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
If you really mean it, I will.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
You talk as if
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Don't want to talk todon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Whadda you want!
What do you think you're doing!
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Like what?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
It takes money to buy food.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
What's got into you?
Sure.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
sixseveneightnine
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Whatever you say, darling.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
The dame's too smart for him.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Huh?
If it's on the level.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
Huh?
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
I can use a smart guy like you.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
...Oswald?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Four to six.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.  Never heard of him.
Who?
Honey, you all right? 
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
My sympathies.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
For sexual purposes?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I know David - a strange character.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
And you didn't tell the Police?
We are. Don't worry about it.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
My pocketbook.
But now you're telling us now you do.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
I don't think so.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
That doesn't sound dark.
You gain weight?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
No, you didn't. What branch?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
'76?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Does something else worry you?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Why?
You talk them into it?
Has he hinted around?
He tries to act cool.
What about you Max?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
You do that?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Ray wants him.
Uh-huh.
We're partners.
Where're you going?
Wanna go?
Yes'm.
We can look into that.
I'm recording this.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
I'm waiting for the phone.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Are you getting that black suit?
For what?
And what was your answer?
Yeah?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
How the fuck they know that?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I was there, I saw her do it.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Who's paging you?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
When did you get out of jail?
How long?
What for?
You okay?
Were you a disco girl?
Did you ever go I one?
Please.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Whatcha watchin'?
I didn't look like a bum.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Uh-huh.
You shot Melanie?
Came outta where?
Where you shot her.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
Yeah.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
I need your name and address.
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
What's up with this shit.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
How the fuck did he find me?
In a way, yes.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
She's all alone.
Who is it?
Take me home.
Let me out of here!
Remember?
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Short? It's ended.
What are you talking about?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I saw Sarah the other day.
A bit.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Jake, you need to rest.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
I'm not cold.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
That help?
What do you think?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
And look what I got.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
What does it say?
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Remember that.
While you were in the shower.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I want to know. You tell me!
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Why won't you answer me?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Goddamn you!
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
He'll never make it.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Hello.
Still married, Jake?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Can I help you?
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Minimal.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Sergeant!
Better let me.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
Goodbye, my love.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Jesus, God!
Outta here?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
We're screwed!
Rizzo?!
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
I'll help you in.
Now this is getting exciting.
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Hurry! She's lost it!
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Kicker!
I don't understand...what does he want?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
My cars. And a comic book.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
It's three feet deep, Martin
How come you have to tell them that?
Colorful, isn't he?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Now tell me something I don't know.
Only 24 hours!
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
What? What?!
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
What happened?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Look at him take it!
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
I'll drink to your leg.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Really? What are they like?
Wait, let me take that.
Mine too.
Can we make out now?
Hey man.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Cold feet.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Cute?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
No...
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
What?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Excuse me?
Hi Dad.
I sort of already have.
What?!
Or...
Only the one in my pants.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
The Penny Saver sucks.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
What do you make with that?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
You lose!
Are you takin' the pictures?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
What?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Happy birthday Adele.
Tight fit.
So what do you do Early?
This the book your writing?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sure.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
All set?
What about you?
Any word from that gallery?
Early, just think...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
...Janitor's job.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
What do you think?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Telly.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
I hate this game.
Shut up.
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Where you goin' tonight?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Sup. Sup.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
Do you like kissing me?
Uh huh.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Your a real philosopher.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yep.
Oh shit.
Hello?
I can't man.
What do you mean, no?
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Yes you are.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
You think he's dirty?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Hello?
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
What makes you think I was there?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Yes?
Let me speak to my daughter.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
I know he really likes you.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
Any sign of rape?
You mean, no prints but hers?
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
Where were you last night?
Did you send the car?
Peter...
I can check and call you back.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Sounds very violent.
What are you looking for?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know it was bad.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
I'm hungry.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
You beat him.
Me too.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Will your power outward.
Yes.
You have not slept in two days.
I can't reach her.
<u>Why</u>?
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
From here, I must go alone.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I can. Because I choose it.
How did you know?
They can be saddled.
I road them often in my youth.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Once is enough, thank you.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Can't I come, too?
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
I'm hungry.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
A fine match.
Can you see?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
She has the power of vision.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Look.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
It will not help.
I cannot stop the sand.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Wow! It's brilliant!
You see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but I prefer this!
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
How many girlfriends did you have?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
How are you, Miss?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
...Who sent you?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I've seen it before.
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
I don't know.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
To where?
Why?
Most certainly.
I thought you were asleep.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
What happened?
I'm walking there Kris.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
I really want that watch.
What do you want?
Sparkling apple cider?
Are you working?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
What's up?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
There are limits.
You know I love you... yeah?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
About ready for another drink?
Yes? What?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
I'll take that as a no.
Is he always such an ass?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
It's so shameful...
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
No.
Did you hear a shot fired?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
How many, would you say?
Dewey Newcomb?
Did you get it?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Uh -- both?
Yes?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
How'd it go at the trial?
The idiot speaks.
You almost had me fooled.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Josh proposed!
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
So?
I can't.
What the hell is that for?
Up for a celebration dinner?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Of course.
I completely agree.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Now I am.
Well, yeah, but --
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Hovering?
Elle?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
God protect me.
You... you're a beast!
No more... please...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Enough!
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Don't you know?
Track the demon to his lair.
We must follow that bird.
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Certainly understandable.
Wait!
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
There isn't much time!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Sunlight.
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
I was with the Princess.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
You see!  You see!
We seek to undo the curse.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
How're these?
You promised!
A promise is a sacred oath.
What shall we do?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
No!  I won't let it happen...
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Biting you?
I can't see a thing.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Step lively now!
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Please...
What's she doing?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Is he a friend, then?
Simple as that, eh?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Red.
I couldn't get it to go down.
What are you doing up so early?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
I had them in my pocket.
You have to ask like that?
Where's your dad?
Really?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
I was wondering.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I have the permit.
Pardon me?
I've been here twenty years.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Sam?
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
You're here early today.
Hello?
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
What are you doing?!
You'll have money when you work.
Did you got through my pants?
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Why wouldn't she leave?
She seemed upset.
What kind of house?
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Where are the kids?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
You don't look like you.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
You're sure about this?
Queer.
A night in the hole?
He's a big one.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah...
Sharp.
She's alright, isn't she?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Can't you remember your own name?
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
What are they gonna do to us?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
This fork is filthy.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
What does that mean?
No.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
You get ketchup?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
Crop duster.
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
What'd you say?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
All in, boss!
So it don't exist.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
What are you doing here, mama?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Is everyone here?
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Little Nicky.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
No!
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Try an angel.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Where is he? He's late.
Makin' friends already.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Hey.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Hello.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
You think I'm a tourist?
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
You have a dog? What kind?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Yes. What is rent?
No.
Why is that funny?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How did they get in here?
Had enough?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
What the hell took you so long?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Where do you live, Mary?
When do you go up?
You prefer women?
Well then...?
I'm listening.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
You could have called me yourself.
Maybe... sure...
Please? What friends?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Are you sure?
What kind of place is this?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Why not?
What a fuckin' job.
Hello.
Hi.
Pete?
I don't know.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Andy, who is that guy?
Okay. Thanks.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Please tell me.
Repeat that, Bill.
Do you remember?
What is this, Rogoff?
That's it.
It must be from a real estate agent.
What's that? Another tape?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Give that a try.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
No. No, I don't.
What do you want?
Hey... Sheila.
Cable from Gainsford.
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
There you are!
What are we going to do?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Chalmers Bryant!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
If you want me to!
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Where is your mad pilot?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
buy and sell?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Very often.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
What do you want?
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Let me up! Let me up!
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
I'd go mad!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Where did you come from?
Where were you hiding?
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I'm so glad.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
You shot an eight year old girl.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
No. just peace on Earth.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
How does that help me?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
It's marble.
After I got the shit beat out of me!
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
What are you doing?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Did he say where?
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
This it?
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
They're gone.
And they're buying it?
I have to go back.
Just some guy... they found.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
You the only sentry?
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Seventeen minutes.
The mall?
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You're certain?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I won!
It's a little late for that.
Sean --
Who are you?
Sean, wait...
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Which one is that?
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Good God.  What was that?
It's the same prevision.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Precog Deja Vu...
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
You sure? I just made it.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Are you sure?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
I know.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
I don't know.
Honey?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I never promised you anything.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Get your hands off of her.
Your dance is over.
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's that?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where's Ricky?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Spa?
'Trustafarians?'
Yeah?
I'm on the phone.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Ask if he said anything to her.
How'd you unlock my phone?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You fucking nuts?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck was that about?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
We're not getting whacked.
What are you doing.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Put that shit out...
Let's check out the penguins.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
You did?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I want to leave right now.
Don't drag my ass into this --
And where is...?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
What about my keys?
Keeps me out of the army.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
When?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I'll give you back the 600.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
Don't con me.
Where am I gonna start?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Is the program ready?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
What points?
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
Let's talk about you for a change.
I'm in Detroit.
Did you hear what I said?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Get some sleep.
Dear heart, where are you?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
And like a fool I believe it.
Is she hooking?
Get out.
Another one?
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Who the hell are they?
Yes sir.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[Why?]
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Where does he live?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[How does it work?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[What money?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
What is it?
How does it affect you?
Yeah, right...
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Hmmm?
Well, I let him go.
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
Did you used to?
You're late.
Could I ask you a question?
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
Our child's safety is at stake.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
It will be a hard break.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Waddaya gonna do now?
You want me to ride down with you?
Who you gonna call?
Hey! What are you doing here?
Who?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Ufa!
When was this?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
No, Marty, please...
No...
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What time is it?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
It's loaded with what?
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
So I'll die without a son.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
I don't like her.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Sure.
Well...
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Tommy!
Wadda you so sore about?
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
We got to stop them right here.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Gimme three.
Radar!
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Even if I weren't.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Yes, Reverend?
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
I have not understood what you means.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
The blonde dish.
Yes, that's what I mean.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
What?
John Doe.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Looks all right
That's our man. He's made to order.
Hurry up, Pop.
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Colonel!
Who's got him?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Grubbel's here. See? 
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
No!
Join the John Doe Club.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
That's got nothing to do with it!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
What do you mean, too bad?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
Dinner's on you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell my dad.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
What do you got on Korda?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
It rarely has to be done.
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Where did you hear that?
Tell me what you need.
I can't do that.
What did you see?
You know why I like the track?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
I'm just practicing my lying.
How many have you lost?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Please. I'm begging you.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Korda escaped.
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Are these yours?
What do you need?
They have nothing to do with this --
Who are you?!
Divinity?
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
But what if he doesn't --
Where you plugged-in from?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
What brings you inside?
But I don't know anything about programming.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
I'm sorry.
Voice activate.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
Is this... food!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
... What's happening to him?'
Release the power WITH the power.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Hey, boss!
Just shut your gap!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
NINJA APE ZORD!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
I booked passage to London.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We'll figure out something.
I'll handle the Boss.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
And how many soldiers do you have?
He's an animal!
We learn from life.
The Big Picture.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Wanna know what I think?
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Maranzano wants you dead.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Yes?
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Monkeybone?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Holy shit.
Uh huh. And?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
Where'd he go??
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
So, what do you think?
Dating anyone?
You know ...  ... whoops!
What's wrong?
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Huh?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
What dame?
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Taylor, my dear.
Otis!
He's batty!
Oh--oh.
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
A dirty frame!
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
Washington!
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
For a *question*.
Will the Senator--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Just fine.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
A *day*!
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes, yes--
You mean--here?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
I know. It's--Violet.
Letitia.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
What you *have* to do is fight!
Yay!
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
What do you want, Senator?
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
His first 'whiff'!
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
That's going to be fun.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Most every day.
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Feel better now?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Sure. I met you.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You said I was a lady in distress.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Yeah, I know.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Hello, Mary?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Good night.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
That's the rub.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
You can't come up here!
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Look!
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Yes. That is to say
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
That's funny. Why is that?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Naturally.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Who are they?
Farmer?
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
Yes, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Where's your wife, Henry?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
What brought this on?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
That's a lot of people all at once.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Can you help Mom?
What'd you want?
I think you do.
No.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Even if you don't think it's real?
Mom's such a cutie.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
I've offended you!
Is this the treatment?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
And this is legitimate therapy?
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Transference!
Hello?
Sofie...
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I've got three big ones.
Well, there's Lily.
What?
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Yes... your particular approach.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Let's make us even, shall we?
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Can you swim?
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Do I?
We didn't think this through very well.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Hi.
What?
Or talk?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Yeah.
Sure.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's just not enough of us.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
Nah.
Maybe she's right.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
He's turned into a completely normal person!
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
The Obliterators!
Are you famous?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
So what can I get you?
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
She likes you.
Be a Mohican.
And a social life.
Where am I going?
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
I'm glad you like it.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Please...
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
General Bonaparte?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Yes, sir?
No, they're living in Nice now.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Ah, that is good.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were any of them married?
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
But you will not... be safe...
What the hell is the matter with you?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
And where do you place Alexander?
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
Come in.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where you going?
What you mean talk to her?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Me neither.
I ain't trying to rob you...
This you?
Just a little.
What?
Who is that?
$247.
What's the matter?
Blow.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
Karla.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Delivery!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
What is it?
What was that?
I do.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Hey, how you get out of here.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
You just come in on Amtrack?
Where'd you come from?
I have a problem.
I remember you...in the elevator.
For what?
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
This says "invitation only".
You killed him.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
We have to hurry.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Can we go now?
It's a twenty.
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Cover your mouth.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
I've got something for you.
That one.
That's enough.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Uncle Birdie!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Just went?
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Now can I tell?
It's all here.
John, where's your folks?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What are you doing, boy?
All right boy: where's the money?
Nothin'. 
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes; John's bad.
Why, pray tell?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
The first night?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What's wrong, John?
What are you after them for?
What'd you all talk about?
What!?
How you doing, pal?
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
What's the Coroner got to say?
Okay... You need anything, just call.
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
I never touched her.
No.
Do you think I did it?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
Good evening, Anna.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
And you too, Ninotchka.
A dress you wear in the evening.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Which lawyer?
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Good evening, Gaston.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Leon, my little boy.
Let's do that.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What proposition?
Comrade Kopalski...
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
Allow me, Comrade.
If there is anything we can do for you...
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Private.
Confess what?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
I must get into that country of yours!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Thank you.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
And where are we?
Yes, it is.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
I will start with you.
And what do you do for mankind?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You repeat yourself.
I have never heard one.
I wish they had never met.
You see I couldn't shout that.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
I must talk to my brothers!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Did you win?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
That's all right... I grow on people.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
May I have your bags, madame?
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
Your Highness.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Executive clemency ...
How much do you need?
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
I understand that, sir.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
To protect his people.
Where's Hunt now?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
No, sir, you did not.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who?
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Where are they?
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
We could leverage Helms.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
What'd he say?
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
Mr. Castro.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
We took his system out.
Who do you think is behind it?
Why, you got a customer?
Mein Kampf?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
It was illegal, what he did.
... Use his women.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
Of them.
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Because ... I have to relax.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Some say you are, Rocky.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
Want a cup?
Hard to believe.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
He won't neither. He never has.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir.
...This month's checks.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
Don't get hurt.
It ain't even three years we been married.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
I need to know that.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
Airport.
...You need to talk to me.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
Now. We close now.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Well... I need to close now --
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
What do you want to know?
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
Waitin' for my wife.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Then you'll like me.
Not that way.
Were you in Nam?
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Nam?
...I meant your food.
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Jesus...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
It's all right.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
So, call me when you --
...like the water purifiers?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Where you headed, Betty?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
No. Loma Vista.
Doctor David Ravell.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
The fuck you talking about?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Like what?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
It's not here. Let's go.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What doesn't?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Is there a problem, George?
Huh?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
You can't do this -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Pullin' ah pants down...
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Where's your ring, honey?
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Who's that?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
I want to fly jets, sir!
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
No, sir!
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Lynette, where's Sid?
Do you go to school?
I vote for the motel.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
That was great.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
I'm looking for Sid.
I'd like to come with you.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Do you know that for sure?
He said open it.
You got an idea?
Are you okay?
NOT THAT ONE?!
They won't get hurt.
Be quiet.
Cell phone.
Somebody called you?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Oh, I've seen these...
Suit yourself.
Something's weird.
What?!
What if they get in here?
"What we want is in that room."
Call Dad!
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Uhh... I with it sister but...
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
What's up?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
What the fuck?
Inspector Brimmer
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Yes sir I was.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
You were. infantry right?
We appreciate your help with this.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Yeah, I do.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Fuck is up?!
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Am I one of that sort?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Thank you.
Their names, ranks and posts?
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
No, I don't.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
How far away?
Don't worry.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Gray.
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
What were you listening to?
What?
Yes, but--
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
It's funny, all right.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
What are those for?
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Let her go. It's cool.
We got that part.  Anything else?
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
What -- you don't have the medallion?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
You've got sand, for a maid.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
That would hardly be proper.
What?
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Why?
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Dead serious.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
We had time to get to know each other.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Move away.
Because you're a pirate.
Not without my effects.
I'd die for her.
Is that so?
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
No.
Do you have any idea where you're going?
You've seen it?
I think he's telling the truth.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
You can't mean that.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
How apropos.
Oh no?  Smell this.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Consideration?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Daniel...
Really?  What have you been doing?
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
... just like the mouse.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
Just look at it!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What's that?
Argon's private lab.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Exactly.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Will you step into the library?
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Thank you very much.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
No?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
How is her family going to feel about it?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
How far have you gotten?
To Old Madrid.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
What did he want?
What other girl?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
A statement? Good.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
What is it, Smythe?
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
What?
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Wait.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh.  I can't.
I don't believe it.
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
What happened?
Did you do this?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
I think I've got something to say.
It's not in ME.
What do you mean!?
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
How'd you know about the fire?
Hello Bud.
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Jen, listen ...
You have no right to do this.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
So what's it like?
How?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
Can I open it?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
McIntire's.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
BUD.
I want a word with you ...
What do you mean?
I had nothing to do with that.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
EXCUSE ME?
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Dream come true, hunh?
Hey.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Well, I can't talk though --
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
I know.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Are you gonna do it?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Tell me why.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
...yeah....well you have me now.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
So you think you can?
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
-- you said you did.
It was cool last night.
Do you know them.
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Do you want to pick me up?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
How long have you known her?
....No....
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Have a good trip.
Yeah?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Ok.
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
No.
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
Can we agree that that is that?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
What's up?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
I know.
What did you say?
Put him through.
It's ok. That's alright.
It's not bad, it's ok.
Are you ready?
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Free his mouth.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
I have a proposition.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
NEVER!
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Oh. That.
I have.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
As you say, Doctor.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
It's a long story, this one.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Good God, Marquise --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
How was I to know, my darling?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Doesn't that please you?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.

Hedy Lamarr?
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Very generous
You're going to destroy it

What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
I think you better sit down
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
They wanna talk to you.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
You're a good sport, lady.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Who's that?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Huh?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
I can't find my ball.
Take off my pants.
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
But, Jake, I was just...
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Huh?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
What'd you see?
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
But they don't have a case against you.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
No, you're his wife.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
-- until yesterday morning.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
Jeff -- huh?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jefferies.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I can't. The police have it by now.

Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
She's only perfect.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Mrs. Thorwald?
No.
Ten here.
Hello.
Who's Thorwald?
Something big going on somewhere?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
Lisa, please!
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
No comment.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I hate funny exit lines.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Huh?
I'll rephrase the question.
Well?
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Chelsea 2-5598.
Steady Marlon!
What's that?
You know something?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Machismo?
You satisfied or you want more?
Buzz Gundersen.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Hey--I want to ask you something.
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Go ahead.
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
I was talking to Jim.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Are you going down there?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Frank!
John Crawford?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Jim!
Isn't he schizoid?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Can I keep it?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
I'm getting that way, too.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I never felt so clean before.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Plato, where's your father now?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
She's being called for.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
He wants the money.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Gabriel!
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
You forget where I work?
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
He'll kill you.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
He working for them on this one?
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
He says he wants it now.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
What?
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
I had better sex in prison.
What'd they call her in college?
You do.
Do I get a country-western name?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
No way.
You gotta be kidding me.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
You gotta get someone upstairs.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --

Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Rudy, don't move --
Jesus, Rudy --
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
That was my king!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I'll call somebody.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
A little.
The Brewers.
Mr. Brown?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Wong?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
What's this guy's problem?
For what, the cops?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
I'm cool.
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
What?
No shit?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So, is he dead or what?
Why!
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Of course.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Who shot who?
You can't leave us here.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Are we leaving?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Tell me, darling.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
In a fight?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
How's that?
I can't take her with me.
That something I shouldn't see?
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Go on. Have another try at him.
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
What comes after Z?
Then I know my alphabet.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
She was only teasin'.
That's it.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
So, I guess I can go now.
You sure?
I meant you're into ghosts.
Buddy...
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
What should we get?
Are you okay?
Okay, I get the point.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Where's Shorty?
This can't be happening?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I finished all the interviews.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
She's right. We should stick together.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
You mean to tell me we're dead!
I'm so glad you're here.
Father.
What does it say?
Oh, boy! 
Mrs. Sutphin?
Here we go again.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
He goes to college with me!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
What did you just say?
So you do drink?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Who wants fruit salad?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs... Sutphin?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
I'll give you fifty cents.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I don't know.
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
I have been at the library.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
But you would like to know where she is?
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Yes.
You play an instrument?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Would you mind?
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
So what about kids?
Why is that?
Aren't you?
Hi!
What are these?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
If you were in love with me, would you?
Like maybe a big part?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Something wrong?
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
What?
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
What visitor?
No, he left last week.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
What?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
No!
Apparently.
Why?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
And that's all?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
And you ask questions, right?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I would.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Afraid of getting caught?
Hello.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Who?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Student?
Everybody has a past.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
No.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Mr. Millaney?
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Medical clinic?
Anything wrong?
Can I call you at the office?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Want me to breathe deeply?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Yes?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
I'll leave you young things to it.
That's us.
I'm not going, Janet.
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
But they only think they're happy.
You shouldn't have said that.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
I NEED SOME
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
BRAD!
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
THAT MINIMAL
She walks in beauty...
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
How's the trip?
My condolences.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Are you a writer too?
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Whoa, why are we getting off?
What?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
It does. Feels right.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Nice, huh?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
Oh, boy.
Hey, there you are.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
With Maya.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
What's that supposed to mean?
We gotta go back.
She tell you she was married?
So what's the plan?
Me?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Come on, let me drive.
What's wrong?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Nice. Very nice.
Are you all right?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Oh. You mean... today?
Well...
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Maya.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Oh, Maya. No.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Sir, what are you doing?
Should we get dessert?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
See you, Miles. You take care.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
There's dust in it.
A hair.
Daddy.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I don't want you to die.
Hi sweetie.
You do?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Do you think it's a possibility?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Merrill!
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
I can't even imagine.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Is that him?
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
I think we lost 'em.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
You must have known that before you came.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
You're not Baxter?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
South of here, past Chimayo.
They got a saloon there?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
You might make a farmer yet.
You own this land.
Because they don't like what I want.
New record.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
Hello, Rae.
I've given that up.
You got a place to stay?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
You really are a gambler.
I've got a place I can hide her.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Even the fall from the plane?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Mom, do you miss Dad?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
What I do to Simone?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Absolutely not!
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
-- Flesh is weak.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
She still with Kent?
There was no other way.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
One thing bothered me.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
What now, Sayer?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
What if it catches on fire?
Hi.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Wow. They called you their son.
Why, Malcolm?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I'm going to see you again, right?
Know what?
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Someone got hurt.
Cole, you're scaring me.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
I don't know how else to look--
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Fuck you.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Bitch.
Suzie???
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Are you crazy?
"With a hack-hack here --"
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
It's time to make amends.
Ow!
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
What about Jeremiah?
So?
You wouldn't understand.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
It's my nature.
What?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Hey there, Chief.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Where'd he go?
You.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Why're you driving so fast?
But you could get killed, right?
Where you from?
What the hell's going on?
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
See ya, Kate.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Or in the slammer.
Bandit?
Loud and clear.
Hit the brakes!
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I hate to say it...
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Bandit II?
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Shut up, Fred.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
How bad?
No.
Who?
You're sure?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Man, that's great.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What'd you say?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
I am. Yeah.
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
I can't discuss --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
True?
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
What'd you say?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
That's fantastic.
She'll come back.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What plan?
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Jesus...
You're better when you take them.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Why did you say those things?
He has a point.
Who have you been talking to?
Why did she do it?
You don't want me.
What's happening to us?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Is that really what you want?
What does it want?
Snow, get up here, now.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Let's get a drink.
I'm sorry about what happened.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
You put me life in danger.
Stop being nuts!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
What do you want to do?
Are you okay?
They guys treatin' you all right?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Mike.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Bought it.
Coming to bed?
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Watch your step!
How do you know where the gun is?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Yeah--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Would you cool it already?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
You're making my life difficult.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Hello, Liz.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Waldos.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
A match made in heaven.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Peter, what can I do for you?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
So they're airing this tonight?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Do you... live around here?
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
What's wrong with him?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Come again?
How did he get over there?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
You are being rude again.
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
You'll fix me up!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
May I have this dance, Miss?
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Says me.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You taking Dunbar?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
What guy?
I do not want those cigarettes.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
That is my wife.
You heard him.
Where is he now?
Captain=8A
Data, are you all right?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
What?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
Can you locate them?
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Left behind?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Aye.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Response?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
What happened...?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
My God...
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
... He spoke of your friendship.
He asked you not to grieve...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
So!  Speak!
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Uh -- what are they?
It never rains but when it pours --
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Until now.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Don't tell me you've got something.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
They won't --
Departing dark side, Regula.
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Scotty -- what's left?
Just barely, sir.
She's not responding...
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Yes, Spock.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Carol Marcus --
The prefix code?
Affirmative, Admiral.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
How're you doing?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Bones --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
An experimental device, doctor.
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Find it?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Yes, sir.
Do you trust me?
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
... Who are you?
... Gone?!
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Spock: Condition report!
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Ready sir.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Systems report.  Communications?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
Bearing!
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
A perfect moment?
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
Don't you ever get tired?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
I do not take orders from you.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
That's your expert opinion?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
Would you like something to eat?
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Scanners are off line!
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
... Population three hundred million...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh.
All hands. Battle stations!
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Are you saying they won't help us?
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
Is it Japanese?
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
What did you do to the batteries?
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
No... the door's too thick.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Did you need something?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Friends from Cornell...
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Port battery, ready sir!
Target locked!
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
Wil... Data was down there.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I remember it made me sick.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Or not to be -
Figures.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
WHAT HAPPENED?
He's a DOCTOR!
Are those your words?
Spoken by you?
You were demoted...
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Torpedo room--?
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Aft thrusters -
I always wanted to try that.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Surely not.
Me?
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Spock, I'm really tired...
Captain...
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Close enough to beam down?
Captain --
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Her own father...?
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Sir?
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
Do you know where you are?
Beverly, come in.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
How long does he have?
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
How long until we reach the fleet?
How can you be sure?
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Imzadi. This is so good.
You're not here.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
So, human... you've met your better self!
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Strength in numbers?
Anything.
Praetor?
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
We need to talk, just you and I.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
With a full head of hair.
What are you doing?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I don't know.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Report!
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
My God...
No -- this is wasting time.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
And?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
You have one with two beds?
What do you do?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
I don't like it, George...
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
I just retired.
What?
No gas.
Closed?
No gas.
No.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
What?
I...
Sun...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Eh... yes...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Asshole!!
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Help me!!!
They after you?
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
No, sir. Radar.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I told you...
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
That's a good one, coming from you.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Let's work it.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
I always do.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
And what about the guy that was following me?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Tell me.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Mace... you're a girl.
You see Tran?
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Are we under arrest?
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
No.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Jesus.
Look...
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I'll take it into consideration.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
There was talk of a file photo.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
You are so fucked up.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
It's a no-no.
I've been thinking about this.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Then there's the other issue.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Hello?
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
What happened?
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
So you went underground?
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
How far is Amarillo?
You've been through worse.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Hi.
Like the quiche?
How?
Like what?
What else?
Anything?
Charles! What's up, man?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Hi.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Who's your booking agent?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
It's definitely a step back for me.
Why?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Sounds more like Aids...
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Pause it. 
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
That's not cool.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Mikey's the big winner.
You think so?
She likes you.
That's bullshit.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Baby, you did fine.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Oh... a Dorothy.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
I just need some time...
Don't remind me.
Selling scrap metal.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
No. Doesn't that suck?
...the Copa, in New York...
We got the digits, baby.
Tomorrow?
So, two days?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Is she looking at me, baby?
Yes she did.
...shivering...
...honestly...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
It is on.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
But your daughter is still alive.
Eat it, it's on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
What is this nonsense?
And this?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Things went badly in Palermo?
What is it?
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
What time do they expect us?
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Send some bodyguards.
We're going to New Jersey?
Do you renounce Satan.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
Yeah.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
Hi Tom.
I'm intruding.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Good afternoon!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
I have to go to Venice.
And Rome.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Shoes too?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Okay.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Dickie!
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Where does Dickie live?
I found Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Dickie, my God!
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You're kidding.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Do you want me to stick around?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
I don't remember the exact date.
Thank you.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
What hours do you work?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Damn.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Travis?
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
That's fine.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
That ain't much of a name.
Listen...
Do you understand why I came here?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Why should it be grounded?
No.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
He's got a gun, sir.
What, vou?
Partners?
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
What.
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Here we are.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Did I what?
A few.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
You can't testify.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
That was beautiful.
That's my r-r-rent.
Please, sit.
What happened?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Yes?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Then why did she object to you?
I don't understand.
I did.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Mom, they're in a cage!
They haven't harmed anyone.
Is smoking fun?
No, it's Lois!
Good morning.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Where does he live?
See them two big trees across there?
I see. How do I get down there?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I wonder if you could tell me...
The little girl's name.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Gulls!
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
Oh. I see.
Lovebirds, I see.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
How long have you known her?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Yes?
When do you think they'll come?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Sixty...  Oh.
I understand completely, sir.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
What did you say?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
When?
What are you? A policeman?
Do you practice here?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
With... with Annie, of course.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
And you didn't come up here to see her.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
But not for me.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
What it was, probably...
It's so damn quiet out there.
The town looks clear.
What time is it?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
There we are!
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How do you plan to do that?
Mr. Gray?
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
You asked to see me, ma'am?
You have his promise, then?
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
This is not a woman!
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
This is a gift.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
Any attacks of pain since?
But can anything be done for her?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Where is it? This place?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
Daisy. How did you know?
It's ok, it's ok...
They botched the execution.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
What is it?
They killed her because she found out.
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Are you an FBI man?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
What does that mean?
No foolin'? Will you?
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
I don't know how to thank you.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
What is it you want?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
No. That's all finished.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
What's that smell!?
Oh, no...
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Still mad at me?
Michael, are you still in bed?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Max... what are you talking about?
What's your name?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Ouch.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
This room is mine.
Do I have to do this?
Go away.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
I'm making you a sandwich.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
Star.
Where these tracks headed?
That night?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
What you doin'?
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
Torch them!!
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
You ain't tying me up.
Well, who's got access to it?
And if anyone tries to wake me...
How many in their party?
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Get back!!
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
When was his mother taken?
Yes...
It's what they want you to see.
Vox --
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
Why?
So you take their best...
And why not?
May I help you?
You're late.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex, what is it?
Heavens, look at that now!
I was not.
In the future, we'll be better.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
I've been working.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
Good night, David.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night, then.
This is magnificent...
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
I don't understand...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
You done with your small talk?
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
But I like it I guess.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I looked it up.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
I might not be able to.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
How you doin'?
No. I don't want it to.
What case?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Becker does? Are you sure?
You ever been to jail?
Can you drive?
Why?
Good God.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Oh shit.
Stop.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
How?
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
But you think he fools around.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
How do I look?
Holy shit.
You think you've found your calling?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
This is so beautiful.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What?
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You awake?
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
What in the hell is it?!
Now what?
Where you goin'?
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Why not?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
Never met him.
Mary's a babe!
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Dom? What are you?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Stalker, huh?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Lint?
Mary ah, forget it.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Uh, that's okay.
Miami?
Jai alai?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
You know, I really should take your card.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
You what?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Thanks for picking me up.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
I see where you're going.
So who's the lucky guy?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh yeah. Fine.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Are you all right?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
Well... why don't you move back?
But but what about Steve?
It.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
No! I was pissing!
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
How's my favorite President?
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
What's this about?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
What the hell you doing?!
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Why does he wanna see me?
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What was he saying?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
What's that?
1868...
You take care.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Ray. X22.
What ya want?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
I'll bet!
What if he's not?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
It dies. We live.
No!
Does it bother you?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
Well no...inverse order.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Looks like a tie.
I live here, remember?
Sir?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Were upside down!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
No! Not again!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
You ever done this before?
It's a victory roll.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
What to the rebels want?
First time on Mars?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Kill him.
I'm with an very important client.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Suppose I do...then what?
What is it?
Pull them out.
You're Kuato, right?
Shit!
Yeah.
No shit...
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Shit!
He's not at ground level.
Is that better?
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let me go!
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Let me finish!
I suppose you're not here either.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
As real as any memory in your head.
I'm not interested in that.
She wasn't really my wife.
I thought you didn't like me.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
What can I do?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
You know, up the jeep trail.
You didn't cook breakfast?
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
So long, cactus!
You're full of shit.
Oh, Jesus!!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Prairie dog burrow...
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Son of a bitch!
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Well, what's wrong with it?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
...we had to lick his boots clean.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
You're implying that I planted a gun?
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
-- Eddie...
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
A fucking wheelchair?
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
But why?
...I'm dying out there.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
'lo, Cecil.
Oh come on, Cecil.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
I followed you here from court.
Look. Mister --
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
What color hair will she have?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Yes...
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
No.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Noooo...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Call me.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Nice night.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Why? It does.
We were supposed to be together.
What about tonight?
What's going on?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Good night, Mom.
School?
Let me see.
Who was that?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Did you get this from your lover?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
What's wrong?
You're right. There's no one here.
Come back as soon as you can.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
We thought it was just.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
This is going to drive the ante up.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
They lied.
I do. Yes.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Orthopedics?
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Anything special about the case?
Thank you. When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Dr. Gruber...
Yes.
Thank you...
Thank you.
One hour.
A single hour.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I need an extension for my case.
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Do you think it's my fault?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
Dr. Gruber.
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
Another, Frank...?
It's a long road that has no turning.
Uh...
...now who is that...?
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Dr. Towler...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Is that it over there?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Where are we?
How long was I out?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
What is that gizmo?!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
What if it isn't over?
Yes.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Heather?  You doing okay?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Why did we begin this?
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
There's still a way.
Where's Mom?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Albatross?
Yeah.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
He does.
Can we talk?
Is it true Phil?
Do you have your ticket?
Jesus.
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Uh, huh.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Spying?!
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Who is it Philip?
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
What's your problem?
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
I don't.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What?
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
We've got a problem.
Suicidal...
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
What's Cao Ben?
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
What's she doin' here?
No shit?!?! You know him?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
But I'm wild at heart.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
You won't of missed much.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Hey baby...
What brand'd she smoke?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
You okay, honey?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
That don't smell like a More.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
Oh shit...
They have, sugar.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Mama???
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I knew you'd want it again...
Have it your way... But you want it.
What do you want me to do about it?
Take care of him?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Explain it... I told you.
Where? In the leg?
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Where we goin'?
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
By who?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You really are one dumb asshole.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Trip??
Is that just beer?
He is. Take my word for it.
Yes.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
So whose car is it?
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
No. But I don't think that matters.
The last month maybe.
Better luck next time.
Who's got a gun?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
So what are you doing out here?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Want me to get that?
He didn't give his name.
The guy on the phone.
But... ?
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Who?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
What?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
What would you call them then?
I'm not going with them.
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm a little worried, James.
Yes, Hannah?
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
I got the message you called.
Emily left me this morning.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Not have it.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Oh?
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
He told you.
And what did you say?
I know.
Did you tell Walter?
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Listen, Antonia --
It's three-thirty, Grady.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Is it good?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You doing okay?
Five years.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
Fucking Mariners.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I'm just talking, man.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
What are you looking at?
I don't like starlings.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
What are you writing in that book?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I'd say you're moving.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Yeah, like the bird.
No.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Why not?
How's the journal?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Why do you think you're here?
Do you know what "normal" is?
How do you define it?
How do they know?
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes.
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where are you?
And what are you doing?
I'm only asking questions.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
You're quiet at work.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
So, you're not a dyke.
Do you?
How about in the morning.
Sorry.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
You really believe that?
You know, this is crazy.
I got poked around... here and there.
I love my brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
Don't do that.
Sneak up behind me like that.
I didn't sleep well.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
You done impressing yourself, ace?
How you guys doing?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
What's goin' on, Boss?
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
You wanna know what I think?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
He's jammed the mechanism.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
That's Perry.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Uh, oh...
Would we see the flash?
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
And how long will you be away?
Used to what?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Claudia, let's get married?
It's divine!
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
It's really a fact -- there's nothing new under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. Sandro, that's how you should design your houses.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
And who is this?
Ettore...
You men are all so dreadful!
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
What other boat?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Are you the owner of this place?
Whose boat is that?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
I can't say.
She'd punish me.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Why?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Why?
Should you see a doctor?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Yes.
Down... there.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like to be?
Do you know a Marie?
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Like what?
What things?
And you're unhappy.
She can't hurt you any more.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Who am I?
And why am I here?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Hm hmm.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Which one?
Who?
Is someone in the room with you?
Yes.
She'd seen him too.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I don't know.
Thanks. 
All I want is one more week.
I'll have a decision by next week.
No.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Was there a priest?
What's his name?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I am...
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Mary Magdelen?
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
The usual ten per cent?
Lay them down.
They're yours.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Ever seen one of these before?
I see you go to the night court.
I don't snore.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
What's up?
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
I don't think that bit's right.
What are we waiting for?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Thank you.
What are you?
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Where are you off to?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
And we're looking after him, are we?
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Behave...
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
I'll brook no denial!
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You are.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
That's mine.
Stop picking on him.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
Down the ... er ...
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
I got it.  Oh boy.
What is it?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Breathe deeply.
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Why, what's wrong?
You like this shit?
Dead!
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
Hey now, what is this?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Yes.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
This should do it.
This looks ancient.
And what do we do when we find it?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Okay.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
This ship is full of cat hair.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
What is it?
Let's get back and call this in.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
How many of them are there?
Where is she?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
What's going on?
Deal.
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
Something spooking the rhinos?
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
Thanks.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
What?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Jesus.
How do you know my name?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Just like that, eh?
I don't think that's funny.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I don't think I'm going.
We never met. That's why.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
I'll check with Eve...
Happy little housewife...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Thank you.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
No heart to burn.
What fire and music?
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Yes, dear.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Every day.
Don't run away, Bill.
You hear all kinds of things.
Find out.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
Kill the people.  Got your key?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You're not going, are you?
Mrs. Richards.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
If you'd like.
I'd like to hear it.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
How much time have we?
He's in love with you.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
It's just possible she didn't...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Eve.
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
I'm sure.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
I don't think I could be.
Call, what call?
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Miss Caswell?  What?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Are you breaking the contract?
Hey?
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
Anything you've got.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
You overslept?
--jeeeeeeesus--
Morning or night?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
But you know who did.
Speak.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
Hey, easy...
One minute but then--
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
So tell me about the Times article.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
What?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Where in government?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--who you got?--
Anything?
That was awhile ago.
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Go on.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
What are we gonna hear?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
No you haven't.
No.
No comment.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Ow, what the hell?
But, but -- what would I do?
Jim?
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
This was remade?  Into what?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
You did it.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Jim...
Ho-lee shit.
Tonight?
Let me know.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
But you don't love me.
Yeah.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Contact, dude.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Don't you want to change?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Hello?
I don't know...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
We don't both have to die.
Pull over! Now!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Uncle Terrence.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
What were you showing her?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Is everyone all right?
Poor Meetoo!
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
See? The Princess is under there ...
So where will you go?
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Hey, you on television?
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
We've been through this.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Right!  Where?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
I'll see yuh.
Fifteen years, huh?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
No.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
And blind people, crippled...
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
What are you doing?
Uh-uh-why?
M'hm.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
You're so sure about it.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
Christ!
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Tsch, a few.
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Charlie Chaplin.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
You all right?
The one with the V.P.L.
M'hm.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
There were many men interested in you?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
What's that?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
So where is young Jonah?
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Can I open it?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
And?
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
In the kitchen.
Still champions.
Not properly watered.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Don't be so sure.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
I know.
No.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Happy anniversary.
I know.
Coffee?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
And I you.
You lose this?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
I've never done this before.
Ryan's really angry with me.
That's very nice.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I'm so sorry.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
The charades.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Would you, like, marry him?
Are you lovesick?
How?
Like the last time.
Everyday.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Um.  Happy for you.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Nevermind.
I trust you.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Really?
You dance...
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Water...water...
Out here I'm just what?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Of course not --
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Z!  Over here!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
ARREST HIM!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Ask me why we're so successful.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Time to cut a rug, Z!
Not there.  Under the mat.
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
What is it?
Your phone.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Here. How about some breakfast?
And where are you now?
Your stomach?
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Cut.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Do I have to?
You sure you want to throw that card?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Thank you.
I know so. He's a taker.
Shall I light the candles?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I guess so.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Baxter?
The Vice Squad?
You know how people talk.
To me?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Yeah --
Yes, sir.
Don't mind what?
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
You can't come in.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Good evening, Baxter.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
She going to be all right, Doc?
What are you going to do, Doc?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Any of that coffee left?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
What about him?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
You got a girl-friend?
No kidding.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
That guy really must've belted him.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
Remember what we talked about?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Where does she live?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
What !
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
We've been attacked.
How about a drink ?
Rangers, eh?
Yeah.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there ?
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
So what happened ?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
What do you see?
That's a light down there --
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
They're not Cong.
I --
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Who is he?
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Captain?
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
Good swell.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
You've gone crazy.
Were you with him, when...
The other one --
What?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --

Oh.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
He's coming around fine.
I'll go into town with you.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
That's not what I meant.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Been driving long?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Can you walk?
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
What's wrong?
Why the smirk?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
...Ben never sent a signal.
There's what they're waiting on!
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Me. My home number is on this card.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Spencer.
So what are you doing with a dog?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Stop asking everyone.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
What do you want, Melvin?
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Was this supposed to be your room?
Can you not be violent?
No!!!
Uh-huh...
How to die, mostly.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
What?
Shall I get her for you?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I think you gotta camp it here...
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Probably.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Who?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
What?
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
An assassin?
Why?
Why?
Forget it!
It looks like white's game.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Why?
No.  Just the first one.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Good.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
You didn't take it.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Yes.
Why?  I don't know.
What happened to her?
I'm taking off my mike.
Electra --
Hi.  Did you call --
Would you like a drink?
For what?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Is that all you want?
Right.
Can I ask you something?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
Of course, senor.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
But we are underground?
Like Custer huh?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
That stinks!
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Like helping a sick kid?
We're going to need it all.
Red or white?
Huh?
Now you're using that word.
What do you want me to do?
What about me?
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
About forty minutes.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Will this thing take long?
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Did you take your things over to my place?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Really!
No, just a drill.
When the hell did you write that?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
It's more than what you're worth.
Why are there still such headlines?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
What if they expel you?
To see your father?
What are you doing here?
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
That's deep --
I know you don't want help.
What the -- ?!
I'll take a chance.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
No problem --
I know. Don't say anything.
Because I try to be nice to people?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
Yeah.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
You're not in a very good mood.
You were great the other night.
It's a start.
Hey.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
You make me feel...
From citizen high to citizen low.
You're worried about your college applications.
Are you frightened?
You know how to waltz??
It's gone now.
I'll talk to your father.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
What's Landon Carter up to?
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
How about your family?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Landon. You go on home.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Hi, Marty!
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Dad, you seen the drill?
Oh yeah.
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
'Bike fine point?'
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Who, me?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
What?!
Eight thirty.
Catch you later! 
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
That's all taken care of.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Suzy!
What did you do to your hair?
Oh yeah?
Yeah, I guess.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
I'll catch up with you.
You ever held another job before?
You lost that one?
Then why'd you do it?
Good luck to you.
Why not?
What a nice place.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Why?
How you doing?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
What?
Hi.
Hi, whatcha doing?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Think I'll take the juice?
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
There's another one we owe 'em.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Anybody we know?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Dead.  Damnit!
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
Where're you goin'?
He offered you money?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Pictures don't lie.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
So where's Buckaroo?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Let him go.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Hello, Barton.
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is.
How d'ya like your room!
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I beg your pardon?
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
What's that?
...Huh? No, I'm 
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
It's okay, it's okay.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Hold on 
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Yeah, but Charlie 
Sure, Charlie.
...Where did we put him?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Is this multiple choice?
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
So -- how are things?
How's not smoking?
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
I thought you hardly know her.
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
Why did you change your name?
You should do something about this lock.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Did you go home with him?
Did I miss something?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
Even though you were fucking him.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Ice?
What did you pay Nilsen?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
How's your shoulder?
You're in over your head.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Can I talk to you a minute?
No.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
What do we do now, Nick?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Thanks.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You feeling better?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
What was the motive?
Keep your three o'clock.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
Yes I did.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Of what?
New York.
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Cool.
That was my favorite part!
Is Jean Michel here?
Not what?
Would you like to see the wine list?
Who's that?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Drugs??!
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... What's the matter?
... babies.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Would you check out my studio some time?
What's your name, man?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
You see? You have someone to live for.
So keep painting.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
What're you really after?
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You almost sound enthusiastic.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Uncle Alfred?
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
I love you, old man.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
No beauty...
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
No!?
That's gotta hurt.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Actually, he took the car.
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
...Afraid.
And another name for Mystery?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
Al?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
But...
He sure did.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
A hit.
Can't we --
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
I don't sing very well.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I understand.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Are they paying you for all this?
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Do we know anything about him?
Jesus.
Liar.
Let's get a coffee.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
It's very good Bernie.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
Welsh.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
It is urgent, sir.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh, you first.
Turd-burglar...
Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Chief, look!
She sure does.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You scored with two chicks?!
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
She's ready.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Oh, honey, we may need that.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
My God, we're back where we started.
I feel really stupid.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
What...?
What time is it?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Help vouchers?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
Just get some people out of our house.
-- Like you used to be?
What about Betelgeuse?
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
I don't know what that signal means.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Otho'll know what to do.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Where is your mother?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
... Oh? You've heard?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Bravo!
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
What about money?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
... How long have you been living here?
How were you paid?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
Good morning, Mr. President.
Sid, it's useless!
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Yeah...
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Good night.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
So...? Where the hell is it?
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
... Well?
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
You take care too, Bobby.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Malkovich.
Enjoy.
Is the trial date set?
Why, Craig. why?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
I want to try.
How was it?
Why?
We?
Don't forget me.
You fell in love with her first.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Pardon?
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youre implying.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Yes, well...
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Why not?
Who told you?
Im not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
This is important!
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Is there dancing?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Come on in.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
You still know.
No. Sorry.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
They good whitefolks?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
No...no...no..
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
You don't know what I think.
You shaved.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Fuck.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
Sir, please lower your voice--
Almost five!
What's a pederast, Walter?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Kill that poor woman.
Please!  Please!
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Yeah, but what about--
She most certainly was not!
And please don't call her my mother.
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Jeffrey--
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
This was, uh--
What's your point, Walter?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
What the fuck are you--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Have it your way.  The point is--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That wasn't her toe.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
Walter, you fuck!
What's mine is mine.
Walter Sobchak.
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well?  Aren't you?
Who the hell is he?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Yeah, but--
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
Whatta we do about the Mex?
Where to first?
What is it with you people and pain?
how long since he was bitten?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Thank you.
You don't want to go there.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Any casualties?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Whistler!
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Hold out your hands.
-- he's a vampire.
How did you know?
But, he could've --
Graffiti --
It's dark in here.
Any progress?
You don't look so good.
Are you all right?
How's it going, Kam?
You don't have to be.
How do you like that? Right on time.
How did you escape?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Something was wrong.
What's she look like?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Oak?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
--the witch kills children--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
What can I get you?
Are you marked like this??
Absolutely.
You want a hand?
How'd you know they were--
I don't think it was them.
I don't know yet.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Okay, a blur.
The witch?
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
Nice tent.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
Where's Domini?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
Nobody's going anywhere--
--Cotter--
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
403 41st Street, kids: home.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Just let it go, I've got you!
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
What's that?
For a blur?
Cotter'll kill you.
Dad...?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Finally got her back to sleep.
--I know!
Okay. Hypothetically.
What?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Thanks, Meurice.
What was that?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Uh-huh.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...Who?
...So?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Now that don't make much sense.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
You want me to kill 'em.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
Pour that back.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank. Come in.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Come into the study a minute.
Do you like the way I feel?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
I liked being with you last night.
What do you want to do?
I want you to hurt me.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
What?
Oh no.
Who, Dorothy?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
I don't want to go.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Probably not. no. Why?
... Sandy?.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
On the plane.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
You wanna split?
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
What do you got there, Diego?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
Oh my G-d.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Yeah, I'm out.
How are we doing?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
I'm calling it three.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Cocaine?  How much?
Barbara.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
I know.
I know.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Hi.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
Do I know you?
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Well, here I am.  See?
What do you want from me?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
Because she's visiting me.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Second name.
Second district ... Explain better ...
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
I don't do that kind of thing.
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
To show them to the UN, right?
What is she saying?
Who is speaking?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Take some time off.
What about the will?
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
What did they argue about?
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
She's innocent.
That's ridiculous.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Can I go?
Why did you come by?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
How did he look?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Yes.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
October twenty-seventh.
I heard him say it.
What happened next?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Who told you that?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Three fifteen.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Are you going to represent me?
This is your house.
That's not an answer.
Hi, Frank.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Really?
Why would she lie?
You were brilliant today.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
What are they saying?
But Your Honor--
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
If you want me to.
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
It's more involved than that.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
It had to get there somehow.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, I can help.
How bizarre!
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Yeah.
What?
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
I can't believe she's making jokes.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
She's changed.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
This time of year.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Then what happened?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Do you miss it?
You drink bug repellent?
Are you all right?
Why doesn't it scare you?
No, I'm just saying --
Am I interrupting anything?
I'll pick you up.
Oh.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're somewhere else, where?
Uh-huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
What about your husband?
What time is it?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Okay.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
You want us to move in here?
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You got a nice crib here.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
But.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
You know I can't.
Aren't you going to join us?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Are they on the radio?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Open the case!
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, what happened?
That doesn't make any sense.
Violet, please!
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
...  maybe three hours.
Violet!
What?
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You're helping Rajeev?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
What?  How about a drink?
You can't kill me yet.
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Is that the money?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Are they really?
Caesar is your husband?
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
I wanted to apologize.
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
You mean Shelly?
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Yes.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Then what?  Exactly.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
He'll have to run.
Oh, thank God.
I was so afraid you ...
I'm sorry, Corky ...
How'd it go?
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Yes.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I need a ride out of here.
Jesus...
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
So this is it, right?
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
I trusted you.
What is that?
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
xxxxxx...
-- what're you talking about? --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
...your ducts?
What have you got there?
Sign here, please.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Sorry ...
Long time no see!
Triplets.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You think these are tits don't you?
Are you alright?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
We've got both.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Look at that - right on time.
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
I'm going to open it!
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Tuttle?
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I never signed the form.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
This is an emergency!
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
What?
For God's sake, what's happened?
The pace?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I guess I'll be going.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
He's dead, huh?
Did you see my father?
Yes?
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
He's better.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Backup?
He one of them?
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
Whatja doing?
You okay?
Turn it off.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
What did I do to you?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Hi.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Okay.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Did it really go well?
Do you feel good about it?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
The cost-efficient reporter.
We came from Washington.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
It's Aaron.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Because...
Yes.  How do you know?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Is everything all right?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
What?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
It's not opinion.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
One year...almost one year.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I've got another story.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
It's not important.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
So what did you think?
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Take it easy.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Don't you work here?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
A girl with a body like mine?
Oh yeah?
Is it murdered man?
May I please have another little kiss?
It's true, isn't it?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
I like you very much, Walter.
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
It was.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Hiya Carla.
Whatsamatter Leonard?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Maxwell.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
I'm fine.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You left me a message?
Well, stay here tonight.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
I'm going out the front.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Beverly Center.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Everybody does.
Wait a minute.
Put your head back.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Watchers?
I wish you would.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I don't get it.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Hi, guys.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
Why?  Why me?
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
They'll kill us!
Smell of booze much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I really was way way too too.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
No.
That's my leg.
What'd he say?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
God bless you.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
You a God damn witch?
Don't bump me.
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
What do I got?
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
I'm going to the Show.
Settle what?
Why am I a fuck?
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Nuke--  Good luck.
I don't believe in fighting.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Little high.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Who ain't?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at yours.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You were wandering around.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
Okay, Sammy.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Ohh!
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
You think he got the point?
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
All right, fine.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Yeah.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
That's right, yeah.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
She was afraid to call you.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
...and she doesn't always -
We need this guy.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
To Abraham Lincoln.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Why do you need that much?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Get off of me! Stop it!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I put her to bed.
Hi, Sam.
Oh, sh-
Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
...and hypocrisy.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Okay, I'll -
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
No, Sir.
Excuse me.
Yes.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a lot easier on everybody here if we just let her in the house.
Is that what you did?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Yes!
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Do you know that?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
...all the luck in the world.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Right.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Incredible.
Mm-hm.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I know. I know.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Tony.
How you doin'?
My fuckin' head.
Since when do you talk like that?
I know, but that's enough.
Take it easy, though.
Yes, uh...
The crowd bought it.
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
You know, nobody likes you...
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Are you sure?
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
I loved you.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Hey, Captain God!
Did you try to kill...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Don't sneak up on me...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
You seem sad, Spooky.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Nice breasts.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
Was someone in an accident?
What was that for?
You gotta just look the other way.
Are you guys all right?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
How do we get back to the freeway?
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
Any minute.
Do I know you?
And what're you whispering for?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Not a chance.
Did you jiggle the phone?
Did you hear that click?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
You, I would've noticed.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Did you hear that?
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Know what else is in here?
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Five ... six.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Satisfied?
We're waiting on you.
Negative.
And not a nickel.
And then?
Count it.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Yeah?
How far off are you?
Who were you talking to?
Let me talk to the lady again.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
The 405 is coming up.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
What you think?
Good thing in a man.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What was that all about?
You on the game?
He's getting up.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
What's that about?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
What'll it be?
He was different.
What would he think?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Come on, Dil --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Don't.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
No. Can't pretend that much.
Happy now?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Shouldn't be, Dil
Do you like me even a little bit?
You said anything, Dil
You promise?
You want to make me look like him...
Don't call me that --
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
More endearments.
Then say it.
What would you do for me?
Dil!!!
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Perfect.
Give him a cup of tea.
What the fuck is this?
So it was you all the time.
And what's she like between the sheets?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
No, what's the funny thing?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Why not?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
See? I was right about you.
Do you?
We don't look on it like that.
Don't know her.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Don't.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Of course there is!
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- please believe me!
Then say it.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Caf.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
You'd lie about anything.
Your --
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Hm?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Are you going to listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Yes.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
He was American?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
No -- in my room.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Voil what?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Is your husband with you?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Are you in the book?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Who said?
We're here.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
What?
What'd he say?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
But why do you want a divorce?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
I get all your CDs.
Hi Jody.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
You were eavesdropping.
You found her?
St. Michael's.
Really?
Why?
We just found another body.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
No! That's his table.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Someone tried to kill me.
Mark invited me to the party.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
I need to ask you something.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Who?
What?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Where's Sam?
Great. 
He could've called first.
I need your truck.
Go on.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Come on, get in the truck.
You stole this truck!
You stole this truck! That's...
    Elvis is on ice again.
Oh, shit.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
That's right.  Now,  move!
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on.
All right.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Uh-oh.
 Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
They're takin' off.
Okay, here we go.
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! 
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
And I changed the schedule.
No!
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...and the government.
Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Is this your establishment?
Quite a getup for jacking...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Not tonight...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I don't see my container.
...-tainer!
...it.
Yeah?
No sign of 'em...
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...-time. 
My secret?
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
...-m-means, Mason.  
What?  Say again, Ma-...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...you answer mine.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...public drunkenness....
...to talk, son.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
What the hell was that?
Get in 
Do it now.
...gotta seal it.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Is she all right?
Haven't the faintest idea.
How much are you worth?
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
In the garage.
That's a filthy habit.
Where did you get this material?
I'd like to talk to him.
No. It was an accident.
Isn't that your number?
I know what he says.
Where?
That's it?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Not that Mulwray?
Would you like something to drink?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
I got your check in the mall.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Unless what?
Is there anything else you want to know?
I mean I can't tell you.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
That dam is a con job.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
What did he say?  What did he say?
Okay, give me the keys.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
What does it look like?
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
I said I want the truth.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Yeah, Sophie.
Oh my goodness.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
When it comes.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
They were partners.
Yeah?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Will they really find work in Germany?
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Yes. I want proof.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
You understand now? You see it clearly?
Father, I have sinned...
I don't care. I'll wait.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
My husband...you know him.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
How long's it been shut?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
What's happened?
Was the show covered by every department?
I'm sure that's it. 
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Let him finish, Charles.
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
Oh!!
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
Oh!
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Tired?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Yes?
What do you mean by that?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
What?
I'm drunk.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yeah, all in crates.
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
What's this?
Fifty-five.
Why aren't there any lights?
I was here the whole time.
When did you get back?
You saw it?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
Sang.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
How'd you get here so fast?
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Who are you to make assessments?
That's easy to say from over here.
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.
Cute cat. What's his name.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
You only brought one ball?!
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Empire.
I guess.
More or less.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
No!
Who found him?
His dick was in his mouth?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
I want to rent a movie.
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're happy?
Now I know you're lying.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
You're a snake.
There's no lights back there.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
You still didn't have to choke me.
Why do you say that?
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
To say the least.
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I am not.
Oh for God's sake!
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
I said go ahead.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
You're kidding.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
How many?
It better be up to and including me.
What the hell was that for?
You've only had sex with three different people?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
It was only a few times...
A couple...?
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
What are you talking about?
He only speaks Russian?
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
You know how the airlines are.
Tucker?
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
She's losing it!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
I'm going with you.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Please -- oh, no -- please!
That's a virtue isn't it?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
The winds are picking up.
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Gabe!?
Let's be creative.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
No luck?
We might be able to go that way.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Just kidding.
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Right.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Rich...
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Yes. They want to help.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Fucking hell...
How many did I get right?
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
But not now?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Annie...it's Max.
What kind of question?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
I picked up a tail.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
What are you gonna do?
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
I'm in town for a short time.
I got caught up at work.
You're gonna cheer up.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
You should start a union.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Like what?
No.  You say you're cool.
Got it?
Max.
You listening to me?
You said you were visiting friends!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Please.  Don't do anything.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Show up for what?
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
What, no insurance?
You get benefits?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
As in...? 
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Slow down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
She must be some girl.
I was only going one way.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
What's the charge?
People do have heart attacks.
You saved my life.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Shoot.
That was him.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Murdered?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
You look great.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
We're going to Queens?
Connecticut.
What about them?
Is that what they told you?
I don't understand.
Back where?
I believe you.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
I love you, too.
I'm a very patient man.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You made your decision yet?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Night after that?
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Yes.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Can I talk to you a second?
What?
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Dr. Arroway --
Peter sends his regards.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
What is it?  What's happened?
David --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
You...
What...
What?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
So who -- what -- are you?
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
I'd say this is slightly different.
Sounds like a Russian general.
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
But the work --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
You sonofabitch.
That you, Valerian?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Ellie, what is it?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
They don't believe me.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Buck is a deal.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Yeah.
What went wrong?
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
What's all this dirt in the yard?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
What you mean, Luke?
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Oh Lord!
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
I'm in.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
But -- but --
He'll never make it.
Now look what you did.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
You're fired.
When he was seventeen.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Is it an ongoing case?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Halloran.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
What happened to you?!
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Tell me what to do!
Don't hang up!
They all have one...
He was in my apartment!
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
What's Abba?
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
There was no sperm.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
That's going well, then.
It's about time.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
Please finish your story.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Can you drive?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Crash victim?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What?
What's up with you?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What do you think?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Ruth's already taken him home.
I'll see you soon.
Which flowers did you order?
Honestly, Letty.
It had this red spot on its back.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
What have you done with the ring?
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
I do.
Wow.
I love the pillows.
I love your apartment.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Michael.
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
How may I help you?
Something like that.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
I sure know what that feels like.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Oui.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
They're gonna be what?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I only have your word for that.
Why not just steal another one?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
I'm going to kill him myself!
Bring me the scissors.
Do they come with batteries?
We still have to get out of here.
All right, knock it off.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Guns.   Can you get them?
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
You lived there. You know the city.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
You guys used to work together?
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
How are we going to do that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
You like shoes?
Who are you waiting for?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
I don't care about your sword.
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You don't seem to understand.
Do you know her?
This spells trouble.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You're doing calligraphy?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
They forced me to marry!
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Let's end this here.
What do you want?
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Go.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
Talent. Hi.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
They couldn't do anything for me.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Neither.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
What... the hell is that?
Who got himself what?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Thank you.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
You promise not to say anything?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
The Fountainhead.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
About what?
Thank you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
And that's a bad thing?
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
I just came to say goodbye.
Good for you.
But you knew this was important to me.
What do you mean?
That's great.
Are you for real?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
He made you give him a blow job.
It's like a secret society.
What are you doing?
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Just a kiss, right?
Need any company?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
What are the terms?
Fuck her yet?
Call me later.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Who are you calling?
Exactly the opposite.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Ronald?
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Not at all. What's wrong?
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
She's not here.
Did she show up?
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
Did you ever make a wish?
Irena.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
Something's haywire,
I haven't had my breakfast.
Did you mail then?
Amy, not that old tree!
Can't you tell me later?
Just you wait!
What'd you get for Christmas?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
May I pet the deer?
But why?
A lady threw it to me.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
But I only came to give back the ring.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
The Headless Horseman --
I hate the storm. I hate it!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Good night, mother, good night.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
How have you been feeling?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Jennifer?
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
I think she broke the skin.
Where?
Why would they exaggerate?
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Charming Carlton.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Get rid of him!
DON'T call the police.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
About Benito.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
You're kidding, really?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
You busted me.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Except Mark of course.
Hello?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
I need something to keep me awake.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
People...  after me.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
I didn't realise...
Your name is John White.
If you like.
What are you hiding?
What is it?
How do you know I'm innocent?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
For a month.
What the hell is this?
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Fine?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Nightmare...
Just don't call him, Alan!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
What happened?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car.
Presence.
Thanks, I wrote it.
Dave...
We've got to fix this.
What are they?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Who?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What are you staring at?
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Well I guess...
What?
What's wrong?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Hi.
It could be fun.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
Sir. It's quite clear that...
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
How long do we have to watch him?
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
You fired that shot, didn't you?
It's been fired.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Oh God, it's over now!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Mr. Keating!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
I think he's sweet.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Don't stop.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Hey, he's your roommate.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
You what?!  How did you do that?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Well, sure!
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A sweaty-toothed madman
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Look at this.
So what do you think of my father?
Want to come to the study group?
What is it then?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
But if he said no before then...
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
We were talking about my schedule...
Who gives a shit about aft?
I'm not rich people.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Self sufficient...
I don't know where it is!
Like cattle...
What is it?
It's not them...it's it...
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
I think he knows that Joey.
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Or maybe not.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
Who's going?
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
I got delayed. I --
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
You're back.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
You Biederman?
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda, what's the matter?
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
No-o-o!
What are you doing?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You seem... disturbed.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
You do?
You think about it?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
I like it, Nick.
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
What's that noise?
What's that noise?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Kill him... kill him.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
You okay?
Need help?
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
What's this place?
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You be careful.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
You all right?
Yes.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Who are these people?
Anybody can see that.
Grandma, look at me!
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What Grange?
Where's everybody?
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
What -- what's on your mind?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Down, Shep! Down!
Mary--
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
It feels fine now, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mary --
Why don't they come --
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You know that, son.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
It is.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
I'm John McClane.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
One of yours?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
You're very perceptive.
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Yo!
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
John!
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Hey, you couldn't know.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
These seats come out?
Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
Hey, don't take the car!
Jenny?
How are you doing?
Yeah...
So... that sure is something.
I don't have a choice.
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah!
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
What kind of things, Leon?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Okay, is the vault open?
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Now, you -- what's your name?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Goddamn women...
It's the cops.  Shit!
I want him to think that.
To show that we're negotiating.
Sonny -
What'd he say?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
Okay - you got your one.
Hey, let's get ready!
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Did Pop come down?
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...

Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
You did?
Excuse me?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
HARRY? Are you okay?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Mom, you know that never works.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Home school? What's that?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Whoa. What was that?
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Sure I do. On one condition.
I kinda screwed things up.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
Captain Rob came back?
Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
You had some questions.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
TURK, leave him alone.
Why ith dat newth?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
What are you doing?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I am strong!
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Everything?
My Lord!
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
He knows.
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Stop him yourself.
Always?
Liet?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
The Voice again.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
It burns.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
No.  I don't work here.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Sorry...
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
You really think so?
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
I like to think so.
So, Mr. Johnson --
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Lugosi?
Isn't he dead?
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Yeah?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Hey, he cheated on her.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
Eddie...
I'm at the hospital.
St. Joseph's.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
So?
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Really?
Really?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
So...?
Page three of the Post.
It's not their fault.
This is going right up your ass.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Why me?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
You know what your problem is?
Check forging.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Can I help with anything?
Sign here, please.
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
What do you mean?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
What a surprise.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Could you get this? I can't
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Shall we give it a name?
Yep.
Hey Yeah?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
What...?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Can I sign yours too?
You dumbshit!
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Do you enjoy it?
Did they deserve it today?
Look.  I want to see you again.
So you saved her.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
You know him?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
Dudley, we've been over this.
I... No.
No.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Something like that.
Glasses.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
Really?  What did White say?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
On what evidence?
It seems like my Susan, but...
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Not a word.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
It'll be our secret.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
What happened?
What'd he say to you?
What'd he give to you?
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
That's who they are.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
What'd I tell you?
They're here.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
How?
Who's calling?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
That's fine.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Anything at all?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Who did you work with to get the--
Have you been working with Rachel?
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
You <u>swore</u>!
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
Oh, please--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
Who?
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
You don't know who the fuck--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
DePinto?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
You being audited?
I've never met him?
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
What makes you think it's you?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Robert--
Dad!
Where've you been?
Yeah.
How long can you stay?
It's okay to use the phone.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
They killed Rachel.
They're framing me.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
It's been a few years.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
What about--
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Thank you.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
How much did you pay?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
What am I looking at?
Shall we be all right?
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
I'm impressed you can sew.
When were you least happy?
What else?
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Why did he bring you?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
It's so cold.
Oh dear.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
How are you?
Is this you?
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Who are his ghosts?
What if I told you he did this to me?
Thought you'd never wake up!
The team is in mourning, darling.
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Right.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Arguing about books.
What do I do?
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
What are you up to?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Yessir.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
What are you talking about?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
That's doable.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
The Empress Death Mask.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
It's a test.
What about your bags?
That's entrapment.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I know it well.
Only a week?
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
I'll need that.
On what? Another job?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
Aren't we all.
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
You can't be too careful.
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
Hmmm...44 long.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
What about the rules?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Peoples China Bank.
No way to take another day or two?
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Oh, it is.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
You'll just have to have faith.
Call it an expression of trust.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
250,000?
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
What the hell is this doing here?
What's she doing here?
There's more than one?
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Five million dollars?
And get someone to help around the house.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
You're a girl.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
And you can't?
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
I want my fucking money --
So what are you thinking?
Counts?
Fuck Kurt.
Here what comes?
What is that?
And you were told to destroy those?
Ross.
What kind of chromium is it?
Yeah.  A real moron.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Hey -- those are my files --
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
No.
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
You are someone.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
And I miss you.
Think you could learn?
I'm embarrassed.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
I can't ...
... Luke, you must not go.
Barks a blue streak.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Howls.
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
That was no earthquake.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
I don't like this.
What are you staring at?
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
This ought to be good.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
What about Han?
What?
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
You rest now.
A tremor!
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
I have followed my feelings.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
What's in there?
My mind fills with so many images.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
Zira, are you mad?
May I say something personal?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Shit.
I'm already dead.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Get this crap out of me.
75% power.
Plissken...?
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
What're you doing in here?
No screamin' shit.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Well, I'll think it over.
All of us?
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
Good day to you, sir.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
At last...
At your service, sir.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Father...
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Who does it serve?
There are things about love--
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
They do.
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
Here.
Didn't who tell me?
What did the doctor say?
Phonograph.
Rats?
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Are you sure?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
On what?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Yes. He's already here.
Hey, where'd this come from?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Karras.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
No now.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
What is it?
Can you give her something?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
...look down in pity...
I'm afraid.
Frankie.
Yeah, come on in.
What's this?
What're you saying, Charlie?
So?
Trunks?
Maybe next time.
Well, look at this.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
What's the gig?
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
Cindy.
Really.  You sleeping?
Seeing anyone in particular?
So what'd we get her?
Yeah?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
That's what we agreed.
Where the hell is she?
Awe inspiring.
Get out of here.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
I thought we had separate rooms.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
Really.
Funny, huh?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
The party's over.
April.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Cancel, Frank.
What disease?
You don't know?
What?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Jack!
I didn't hear you come in.
The audience was a little off tonight.
Sick?  How sick?
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
What's the problem?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Shoes?
Right.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Maybe it's legit.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You two could play checkers.
Go ahead.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Hey, we're connected.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Whatcha doin' over there?
Thanks.
Right.  Bring him back.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
It went well tonight.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
He do that every year?
How's egghead?
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
You can always get another girl.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Jack.
You mean if I get sick?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
He's lying.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
How is he?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
Jamie ...
You'll what?
Kim?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
You'd have to start immediately.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
What's on your mind?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Jack, are you okay?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
Where do I go now?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Im having kind of a bad day.
You see, its like were in each others heads...
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
But what do I do?
What're you talkin' about?
Are we...?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Jack...dont even start...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Hello!
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Well...Annie for one.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
You look great.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
I want to see you again.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
The shields on the station should protect us.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What the --!
It's about to be a broken face.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
He didn't.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
Apparently I can disappear.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Which was?
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
'Scuse me.
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
How bad off is he?
Right, sir.
Just one, General...
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Difficult? He's impossible!
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
We can't take a second more.
I've done all I could with the laser.
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
I can't tell you.
What'd you do that for?
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
Clear him off the road.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Oh, don't be silly.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Yah, real good.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well, what do ya mean?
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
lot. It's a limited -
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Where is everybody?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
...This is a nice place.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Copy.
Uh-huh.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
We need to talk.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Why are you doing this?
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You're kidding.
In case we want to switch nights.
What are you doing here?
It's time for you to leave.
No, thanks.
Where?  Here?
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
You... don't have to... leave.
He's not here.
I'm sorry, I...
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Marla...
Let go of me!
Tyler?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
You were in here last Thursday night.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
I guess so.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Go ahead.  Say it.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Where's your car?
What?
Alive or dead?
Hemingway.  You?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
What is this place?
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
Why do people think anything?
You have jobs.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Fuck you.
Tyler...
What the fuck -- ?
I'm doing this for us.
Appreciate something.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
His name is Robert Paulson!
I... I don't know...
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Another premonition?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
I'm not sure I understand.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
What?
May we come in?
Take a guess.
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
What is it?  What are you?
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
I'm sorry we broke in.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Gettin' old, huh?
You okay?
Batteries not included.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
What's she saying?
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Can you handle the door gun?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
John.  My name is John.
You pathetic scum.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
You think they'll find any?
Take your time.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
My parents were divorced.
Fine.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
<u>What</u>!
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
What?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
Which ones?
Well there....  What's the difference?
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Have I died?
Where am I?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
I'm not married.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Are there any questions?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
You a fag too?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Don't say that.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Cerveza.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
Is it my turn again?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Bobby...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
No. We have tomatoes.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
Wasn't it, ladies?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Oh.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
How long have you been staying here?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Look at that.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
Nothing.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Why?
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Where are you going?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
That's three games to none, Carl.
Robert, I think you better just...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Not now, I'm busy
What?
Remember me, from the pool?
You know somebody around here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
A play-ya.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Where you goin'?
I gotta go take a piss.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think by Twenty-two.
Yo! What you goin' for
Would you like me to change anything?
Maybe tonight?
Wonder who his supplier is.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
Right.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
My pleasure.
You find the source?
Can I get you something?
Here you are, Doctor.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
And what was that?
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
I'm the Sufi.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Sure you did.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Why don't you try suicide?
So why pick me?
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yo!
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
John who?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Fletch.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I never read the paper.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
I have some ideas.
Fletch, you want an apology?
You don't know the Underhills?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
I don't know, what was the case?
Aha, just what I suspected!
You okay?
Let's get serious...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
This way...
Pretty smooth, huh?
Are you okay?
So, did you find my dad?
It's me.
Two words.  Disco Express.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
It doesn't have to be like this?
What about Don?
Shit.
This isn't music!
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
You don't use shit?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Man, I'm clean.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
Yeah!
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Who is that guy?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
What happened to you?
What about Sal?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
You okay, man?
I'm off.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Lucky throw, fire boy.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
What's going on?
You just burned the desk.
No, not yet.
No wait, don't go!
What are you talking about?
But that's tomorrow.
She just died, your mother just died?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
How you feeling?
She makes ten.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
What?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Wife around?
Nah, just working the job.
Huh.
Who brought up this bright idea?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
It's dark down there.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
What happened that night?
In that little thing?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
I thought that was the end of the song.
Darren, we better turn around.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
...And I said, shut up!
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
You mean you had a bad dream.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Why didn't you cremate him?!
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
You need to leave.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
That's disgusting.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Tell me.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Where did you get that alcohol?
What did you do with Rennie??
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Can't we at least talk about it?
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Everything okay?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I...I don't know...
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
Say it again.
We must abandon.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I think we Nought to wait.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Because we're completely mismatched.
Do you want to get some coffee?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Who is it?
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
A grandmother. God bless you.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
Oh. You know him.
You know what.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
Is it true?
Do you think he can do it?
Oww!
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No violence, please.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
What'd he say?
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
What do you want?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
You mean a general strike?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Who is that young man?
The fools!  Sorry...
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
What are you waiting for?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
What's wrong with it?
You really need that much?
It's not too late to back out.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
We can't stay here.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
Thank you.
Vincent...Vincent...
You can wear lifts.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Where?
I envy you, Jerome.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I'll take care of my end.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
Half a million.
How's Estelle?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
Really?
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
That doesn't hurt.
Promise you won't laugh.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Why didn't you tell me?
There may be a hunting party.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
You okay?
Are we going to make it?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Yeah. I got out.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
That's what I want.
You got it.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
Oh ay?
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
What about?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Though nicer than most?
I call that regular.
Yes.
We went about together.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Thanks for coming.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
You work here, Keith?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Ta.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
So shut up.
Are you tired?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
It's too...
Who?
No.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
You...
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
How many leads have we got?
No.
No.
Yes.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Oh, yes, George.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Clear...
They stole...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
They aren't?
Yes.
Did the leads come in yet?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Aaronow...
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Would you come in here, please?
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
...I only...
Of what?
I'm not sure I have two.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I...
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Don't.
John: John:...my daughter...
When?
They took the leads?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
...yes...
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
My wife told me to look into...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Home...
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
What?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Ricky, I...
I've got to talk to you.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
You don't count Saturday.
What would have elapsed?
What was yesterday?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
I'm...
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
Fuck you.
They took some of the con...
It went down.  I filed it.
Yes.
Are you alright?
Did you like your party?
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Goddamn bitch.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
That's off now.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
If you need anything, just...
Mikey, I hoped...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Go on, tell me.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
I want it met.
Fifteen percent skim?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
No strings.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Is he related to the witness?
Why too late?
Kay, I told you...
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
Where can we talk?
There are still things I have to do.
However I can help you...
This doubles my investment.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
What makes you say that?
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
Something I can do for you?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
Did you kill anyone?
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Everybody has stories to tell.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Storm's getting worse.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
You coming, Boone?
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Then take the pills.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
How's the leg?
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
They gave you only four days?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
You want to come along quiet?
I know you.
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
I guess ...
You ever feel bad about any of this?
What color?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Any word, Kip -- ?
oh.
You getting my checks ... ?
Any more, O -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Kip -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
What are you doing here?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
You okay -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Shit ...
What's with the look?
And here I am...
What kind of trouble -- ?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
I go with you --
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Ready -- ?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Slip it in ...
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
You okay -- ?
What -- ?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Is he still working here ?
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
I'm gonna need some money.
Henry.  Wake up.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Keep 'em coming.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
You want the melon?
I better call again.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
You ready?
You know what to do?
He didn't call?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She's sharp as a marble.
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Thanks, Chuck.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
What class?
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Some other guy?
What's up guys?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
What is it?
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
--That edge!
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
Get out, Will.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
So who won the bet?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
I got it.
Jobs doing what?
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Hello, Sean.
Well, she out did herself today...
You're right. I know.
I might understand that.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
That must have taken you a long time.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
No.
Well, are you going out again?
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Why not?
They could see that I meant it.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
You want to read it?
I know.
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Five minutes.
I really don't 'date' that much.
No I wasn't...
Free?
I want to meet them.
Promise?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
How's it goin'?
Do you play the piano?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Will? Are you awake?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Yeah.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Kinda pie y'got?
House 25. Number's on the door.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
That's the way it is.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
What's the matter?
Lookin' for a job?
Get to what?
I stay in my own yard.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
What's the matter, Grampa?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Got any plants?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
I like the tent better.
How 'bout it?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Pa! Shh!
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Know where we're a-goin'?
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
How about it, Ma?
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Got any more, Ma?
How's it feel, Tommy?
Looks like you done it.
They know he got hit in the face.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Yeah?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
How you get all this money?
Here we go!
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Now you done it! You busted it!
You people looking for work?
You don't...
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
I just play my own collection.
What's your business?
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
Are you going to the reunion?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Shoulda brought my gun.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Will you come with me?
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
What else? Say more.
How was your day, today, sir?
Like a union?
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
I have scruples. Next.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
What's a revival tent?
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Debi's house.
Ten years. What happened!?
He sells BMW's?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
You okay?
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
How long is this going to go on?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Did he mention it?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Nothing.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
What about Grace?
What did he say?
Aw... that's so sweet.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
When are you coming home?
Good night.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
What was it like?
Frank's a good man.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
- See, what you can do for him --...
Of course I have.
That's not a question, is it?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
You want to watch some television?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Secret Service!
Welcome to our show!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Yeah?
Who's that?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
What are you doing?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again, huh?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Shit! Come on!
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Here's your class.
It has a killer refresh rate.
Yeah.
Kate, listen.
What?
There they are!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
You look good in a dress.
Excuse me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Hello?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
What the hell was that all about?
What number please?
Just one moment.
We need to talk.
So?
What's going on?
When did this happen?
Why not?
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Sure it does.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
You won't look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Hell of a night.
Get the outside shutters.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Something?
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
What time?
Look.
He was standing right here.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Lies.
Probably Mister Riddle.
I don't want to.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Fantastic. Totally.
Go get me a beer.
A man wouldn't do that...
What do we do?
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Yes, I am.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Are you sure?
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
I see.
It means... I see.
Pull up to the entrance!
Oh!
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Well, I live downtown.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Is this your first job?
You're Holly.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
...with the affiliates.
How about you?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, thanks a lot.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
Are you in a bad mood?
Why not?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Oh, Mom!
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
What's the problem?
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Oh, Jesus!
You're just realizing this now?
Yeah.  What?
Yes!
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
How is everything?
Yeah?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
I know, I know.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Perfect!
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Oh, God...
Well--
Well, why don't you share them with us?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
No, I am.  I am.
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Well, what about me?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Why are you so upset?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
A reward...
A reward for what?
Well.  Word gets around.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I'm looking for...
Yes?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
Evelda Drumgo.
How you doin?
That's right.
How was America?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Why did he come back?
<u>Do</u> it...
He escaped...
..It won't be long now, sir...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
...they're from Baltimore....
What would <u>that</u> be?
No, no, of course not.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Sir:
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
I said how's your baby...?
Give it up, Evelda.
My husband brought it to me from America.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Yes.  How did you know?
And?  Then?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
No, I don't get you...
...I'm sorry....?
The girl needs help.
You should get Married.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
No.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
I want the money.
...<u>sadly</u>...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Then tell me.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
My encounter.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Now what? What did I do this time?
No.
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody. I know                         ] you like to think of yourself as                            ] the Anti-Oberon, but man, you're                            ] getting just as spooky.

Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
God, you're beautiful.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Oh, I have to hear this.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
You stupid cunt!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
I said I was sorry.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
And your worst enemy.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Mute!
What is this shit?
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
It doesn't work on small animals!
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
You know what I want, babe?
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
You two....
You two....
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Hello!
Who cares!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
Look, Mother!
looks startled at the outburst.
This.
That.
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
I'm coming with you.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Skin cancer.
Pitbull attacks.
I understand... I won't-
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Hey buddy!
Do you know where you are?
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
What's under that sheet...?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You okay?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
The bathroom!  For two days?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
You!
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
You never saw that picture, huh?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
That too.
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
He lost a shoe!
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Right.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Oh, great.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Do you have a family?
About what?
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Neil -- what --
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
And it's a shorter commute.
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said?
I hear things in this house,
How long does it have to be a new house?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Did the cleaning woman come?
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
He wants to see me!
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Are we gonna buy this house?
Neil, do you mind?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Do you see a man?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
What do you think?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
You sure?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
What do you think?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Your life.
Huge.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
Corpses?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
Must you fight him?
He's in there!
We found him this morning.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
You know it's not safe here for you.
Is there anything else you need?
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
What will you do?
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Who sent you?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
We're fucked.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
Can we talk some more when you get here?
What do you want?
Now we can do whatever we want.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
I can't go without Thomas.
That's not enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Louise?
Chief, base.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
What's my name?
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Who are you?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Ten.
Give me it.
What was the response?
Paul, you know who this is?
Excuse me, Colonel.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
What is it?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
I will see what I can do.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
What do you mean George?
) You cannot kill them all.
Satellite feed.
You fucking see that!
Very soon.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Let's have dinner first.
You could have asked for a favor.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
This won't do.
You could leave, Paul.
I have to go out to get food.
Twelve are dead.
How much beer?
What is this about no water?
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
More the merrier.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
What's down there?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
-- closed.
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
-- you lose either way, Price --
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Then who are they?
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Jesus!
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
I was in the middle of --
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
What're you talking about?
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Then who did??
Ghosts killed your father?
Pritchett: what is going on?
We don't have proof of that.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
By freeing them.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
H-how long will it take?
She says she's lonely...
Why?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Mommy please help me!
Oh come on...
But do you agree with me?
Who?
I think we should do it.
You must be the new tenants.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Wha .... ?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Terri?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
You gonna buy?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Yes really.
But you gave me a rose ...
What ... What ... ?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Cameras?
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Alex, are you....
Hit me with your best shot.
Oh, you read that.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Where did you get this?
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
The Shazzammeter!
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Hungry, anyway.
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
...Certain people are --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Oh, Norville --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
I can't print this!
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
I got big ideas, though!
How long've you been down here?
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...Geez.
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
...It is?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Good morning, miss.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
I'd love to.
But, Mrs. Rand --
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
You're single?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
-- But, you're an American?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
That doesn't sound like him.
Why was the maid crying?
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I heard you playing.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
In other words, I'm on trial.
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
The turkey in?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
This just isn't the best moment for this.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Dad stop it!
Good-night dad.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Your toes cold?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Hi mom.
Mikey Williams?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
I do.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
No one.
You get in trouble?
Hood residence.
Right.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
He's dead.
Want a drink?
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Who's that?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
How much closer would you say you were?
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Did you love her?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
I told you I don't remember.
You want me to take you somewhere?
You and Kay were like sisters?
She used some stupid code name.
Down at the station?
I suppose.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Monstrous.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
Are these not the answers you came for?
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
And if I cut my hair again?
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
What plans?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
They would have killed you -
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
We belong in hell.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
It's only a siren...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You found nothing?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
No... it can't end like that...
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Yes.
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
There's nothing between Will and me.
That could break the machine.
Hello? Hello?
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
No.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Be careful, Julie.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
I'm holding your hand!
Ray, I can't...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Ray...what are you doing?
Checking the locks again?
Julie! Wait! You okay?
I'm sorry.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Julie? What's wrong?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Pretty cool bar.
Rio de Janeiro!
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
They were cut loose.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
You're just talking nonsense.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
What is it -- what are you talking about?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
You're crying. Why?
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Get that ladder up here.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
By letting me help you.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
You know where he lives?
Where? I don't see a thing.
A boy?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
You sent for me, sir?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Thank you very much.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
What's that?
She's swell.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Is it a charge, sir?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
What gives?
I know, but . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Well, I don't.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
What'd you wish, George?
I'll take it. And then what?
How's that?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
I can't wait to get there.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Where're we going?
Loser sails home alone.
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Good morning!
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
How long ago?
Untie that rope.
I'm going out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
You stay here a minute.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
There is nothing to discuss.
The what?
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
No.
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Bullshit.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
They made me go with them.
How old is your cousin?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Me neither.
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Give me back my hat!
What're we going to do in the mean time?
But first, a little juice....
You do everything your parents tell you?
I don't care.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
It's Miller time!
You see the three-quarter socket?
Well, not much longer to go.
It's his work.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
What's wrong?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
And leave me down here???
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
You want me to stay?
Finally.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
How is he?
You don't have to prove anything.
Nobody told me.
I want that shark alive.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Why?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
That's because I am the shark.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
Musclehead?
Hi, Mike.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
How long you staying?
The space shuttle has landed!
Gotta sneeze.
No, South Georgia.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
I'll go with you.
Gee, it's good to see you!
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
It sure is good to be home....
Make a list.
Turn it off....
Where's my mother?
It'll grow on you.
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
Yes!
You're coming, aren't you...?
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Sit down, Ma....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I didn't mean to start that....
I'll be all right, Michael.
I want you to give up your work....
It's late....
You and Sean used to make....
You hungry?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
No....
Flies the plane....
You're impossible....
What's wrong?
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I borrow it without telling him....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Yeah....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
You tagging them...?
Office of Naval Research has some money....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I'm coming...How close is it?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Jake.
She's in management....
Woman has taste....
That bad, huh?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Yeah, he can go ...
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Because I dislike her too much ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Did I say he did?
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
What about Citrine?
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Jesus. What are you doin?
Where's your watch?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
Vehicle references.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
What color was it?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know what you're like ..
Ross told me.
Just your age.
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You're looking worried again, Helena?
He doesn't need my help.
You got a warrant for this?
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
When did John divorce?
You think John would like it?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
No one has ever dumped me.
Oh Jerry.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Don't let him stay up too late.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Now what did you lose?
Well, thanks.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Well, good evening.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Forgot your keys --
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
What happened to Denver?
Not right now, Jerry.
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
--  the kwan.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Is that your porty or mine?
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
I think so.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
You gonna get that --
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
You wanted smaller.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
Sorry.
That's him. Thats Eric!
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Eric! Are you here?
Well what?
I don't remember
He could have died.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
How was your trip? Profitable?
You rented an automated litter box.
ALAN!
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Know what this is?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Hmmm.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
Well that's good.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
I don't believe you.
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
Are you looking for a problem?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Cancel that, Dieter.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
What do they want?!
Lava?
What are they?
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
So that others would know about this place?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Oh, God.
Give it more morphine!
Where's Kelly?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
How many lines of code are there?
What?  No menthol?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Carousel.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
The what?
And what are those?
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Constantly sick.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Come on, let's go.
No.
And scary.
Faster, faster!
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
So am I going to help you with your foot?
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
I didn't say you were scared.
Oh my God!
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
Go away!
Watch how it eats!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
What works?
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
I hate trees!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
No, but...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
I think we're lost.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Are you going to plead insanity?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
How do we prove it?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Are you all right?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Where do you live?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You wanted to see me, sir.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
What?
How long were you and Eduard --
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
Gabriela ...?
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Probably not.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Women are all you have on your mind!
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
What have you got there?
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Where do I charter a boat?
Can you fly?
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Man Eater!!!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
They were just tasting the berries.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Are you nervous Jack?
Are you gonna start it up?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Oh no.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Gee.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Well do you think it was him?
You said it was!
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
Please.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Bree --
Mm.
What?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Have you discussed this with them?
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
Are you closing the case?
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
What do you have here, Billy?
Greatest.
Show.
Will she pick me up after school?
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
Salisbury steak.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want a pizza.
Then eat around it.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
See.  That's my name.
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
What don't you understand, pal?
Objection!
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
And how did you find his work?
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
I lost him?  I lost him?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Hey, that's terrific.
Please, come, Holiness.
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I worry about them.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Your father had been very sick.
Cow.
Who am I?
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
I need to squeeze this brain.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
Me?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
I might get a shot.
We'd only just met.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I do <u>not</u> like you.
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Promise you won't kill me, first.
You take care.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
And how would we neutralize him?
Why are you here?  Really.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
Okay.  We're up at six.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
We gotta get to Hector!!
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
He's done.  He's dying.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
What is this?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Should I?
Kelly.
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
<u>You</u>?
You and Kevin.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
What'd I do?
No. He won't come after me.
"- every day."
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
Yes.
No. Tell me why.
Horses - and sheep...
Two months.
I - ran away...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
What?!
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
Will you go back to England?
My letter...
Will you consider that?
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
That is the truth!
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Gold could be arranged.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Their arms?
Qui vive?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Doc eat already?
I thought they were your friends?
No way...
You did good...
Sixpack?
Charge set?
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
What the?...
You read Russian?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Well?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
Is he on his own?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
Yes?
Hello, can I help you?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
What are you doing, Plank?
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
How many feet?
The money, the gear!
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Who's "they"?
Do whatever they tell you--
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
You're dismissed.
Nice job.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
Best part of the job.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
You've been in this house for a while?
Where'd he get all this?
Uncle Al--
My mother said he never asked about--
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
Well--
Didn't have a father?
Dad--?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Mikey--
We been through this before--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
You get much of that in here?
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
This girl has a child?
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Morning, Hollis.
I got an idea what happened.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
Mrs. Bledsoe?
He had the club out on the old trail road--
What about it?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
I'm not open. We were just talking.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
He's all yours.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
Nice-looking kid.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Yeah?
How long have you lived here?
Like your story is over.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Yeah.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Yeah?
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Maybe they're not tricks.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Death.
I'll tell you.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Harry.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
So why did you marry him?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
What did you find?
He was the real thing, right?
He taught all this to Swann?
You said you weren't with him for love.
What was that?
What the fuck?
Valentin?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Where the fuck is he?
Are you finished with me?
What are you, my mother?
Philip Swann?
Any movie stars buried here?
Are you satisfied now?
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
How the fuck do you do that?
Or murdered, like Nix.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Can you do it?
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
How long have you been married?
Oh, hi.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Charlotte, who?
Of course.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
You think so?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Harris?
My stockings.
Lydia?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Evelyn Waugh?
Hair stuff?
Its bad for you.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Are you sure you want to stay?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
I miss you.
It's amazing  there!
I missed you.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
What a...jerk!
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You'll do it?
He spoke to you?
You raised me, like a son.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Father, please don't die.
Well I know he's come here before.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
What's that got to do with you?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Why did he try to kill me?
What?!?!
So what?
Peter, let go of the chair!
You have to say that.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Plenty of time.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
He can see you Thursday.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
What's this?
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
Taste this.
Engaged.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
No I don't.
I can take it.
What?
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
Hello.
A horse?
No.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
You shoot like a girl.
What's that?
Well, what do you know.
So...does it hurt?
I want to ride my own bike.
A ride home.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
That's it, give it your best shot.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
You having fun?
Guess not.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Forget Tonya Randall.
That was so weak.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Who's nobody?
Hey.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Just something I'm trying.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
One game.  One-on-one.
We should head over.
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Still the man.
Just...leave it alone.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
What people?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
I just told you.
What's Mom think?
What are you doing here?
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
You ok?
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
My mother had breast cancer.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Wilson.
What?
Yeah.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Yeah.
It's my favorite place --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
Yeah.
I lost my gun.
It's ok.
No, what's wrong?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Have you ever been there?
It's ok --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
What happend?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
Give me your keys, Don.
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
Hello?
No.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I would just want to clear some things up:
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
the valley?
And your father?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
He's in here.
How long...you think?
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
What? What? What now?
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
What does it look like?
I live alone.
Will you say my name?
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
No.  No.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I love you so much.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Hello?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
Are you on drugs right now?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I can't.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Mmm.Hmmm.
Yeah.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
You ready to keep winning?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
No, M'lady.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
My Queen...
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
What is it, mother?
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
Aramis, this will never --
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Where are we?
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
But -- are you sure?
It's been too long.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Your Majesty...?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Captain Doyle?
Every step of the way.
You mind if I ride with you?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
What?  Wait a minute -
Did you read today's paper?
Where is he?!!
You always carry a gun with you?
What exactly did you see?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Donut?
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Don't you guys ever knock?
What about him?
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
How much do you know?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Why not?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who is it?
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
There has to be.
He's a very shy boy...
Something Lecktor said.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
It does, doesn't it?
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Reba...
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Do you see?
Come in.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
'Intimate? !"
At the store. You doin' some good?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
To do what?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
And... where are things?
Hello.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I figured I'd ask you...
How did it happen?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
What were the yards like?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
How long would they let me sleep?
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Hi...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
You're not listening to me --
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Give me the book.
Are you at peace with your family?
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
That was a really hot house!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
The sewers.  Of course.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Holy fucking shit!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Why not?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
I thought it wasn't real.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
And she knows what?  Everything?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
I'm going to make the call.
Who is?
But an Oracle can.
Should I be?
What happened?  What did you see?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
You can't!
Operator.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
I gotta get the stuff.
You flew before?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
You got some mouth!
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
Don't promise...just deliver.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Diane, how are you feeling?
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
No, she's got epilepsy.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Maybe, who knows.
You know why...with my parents.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Hey... you got stereo.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Yeah, it's your father's.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Just plain 'Joe'?
I hate parties --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
What is this?
I haven't been the father to you that --
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Drew, you're out of line.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
And what would that be?
We have an arrangement now.
Hot or cold.
May I interrupting?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
No, I don't --
No.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Mind if I throw up?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
'Big'?
Yes?
I appreciate you --
How long have you been standing there?
Why?
Yes?
Did you like making love to me?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Well -- I --
How long have I got?
When you go, I go.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
A 'deal'?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
There's one to every rule.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
About Susan?
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Okay.  Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
'Spooning'?
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Uh --
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Those were my words, Bill.
Okay.
I told you to shut up.
He is --
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
What are you talking about?
'The one' to do what?
What question?
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Drew told me.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Daddy, what's the matter?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Then what is it?
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I love him.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Not at all.
I've got to go --
...We know so little about each other.
21.
69.
Well, what then?
Burt.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
So you're holding my calls?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
I like your car.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Why?
I wasn't helping you for money.
So I just take your word?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
What's wrong?
Who?
I'm not.
Don't talk about my wife.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
This is your car.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Why?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
What do you mean "bad news"?
How do you know this?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
It is now.
Bullshit.							*
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
You need to consider a few issues.
Make it 40%.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
We want it back.
How fast does that go?
Where's that?
Where's she now?
Is it December?
Good samba dancing...?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Yero, by himself?
If they attack you...
You afraid of violence?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Yeah.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Packaging?
And there's Dmitri...
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Verdado where?
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Eleven to seven he blows it.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
How?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You sure?
Okay.
And as an investment in the future...
That sonofabitch!
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
The Statue of Liberty.
You sure you heard what I said?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Forget it.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
Sounds like they knew you.
What d'you want?
I simply don't have it, Joe.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Ready for hard work, son?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
The kids? Why are they...
Yeah.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Who?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
What they give you?
What's wrong?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
What?
Never was anybody like you...
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
His name?
What lawyer?
Lady...
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
And a right.
Oh, that's gonna work.
Is there a switch?
What do you-?
He's special.
Which way?
We're no leaving you!
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Oh, no, you were-
No, Jesus, no.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
What's this?
This wing configuration. I've never...
My God.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's it about?
But what?
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Set what up?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
What about a bee...?
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
What things?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Just leave it, all right?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
How grateful?
See anything you like?
Where?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
It is, Billy.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
What can we do' mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
- this is very disconerting..
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You don't trust me.
Have you met them?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
'Terrorists?'
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
To friends.
But why tell us?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
There was nobody on the bridge.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
Youre in Prague?
Yes.  I see your point.
Kittridge.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Zero body count.
I thought I was going to see Max.
You're going to use Walter?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Why don't you take a look?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
The Shawfish?
I won't pay for nothing.
Where you been?
Here.  Ti amo. 
You're my father.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Oh, Cosmo!
You are going to marry my brother?
You don't have to help me.
I like it well done.
Your blood.
What about Johnny?
It's so bright.
But that's cause he don't know!
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
This is where we're going!
Let me go home.
No, I'll tell him.
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Then let's set the date.
Yeah.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
I have no secrets from my family.
WHAT?
No.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What the hell happened to you?
What? He's in Sicily!
Moving in?
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
That's it! That's the reason!
Loretta...
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Sorry. That was rude.
May I walk with you a ways?
I guess you can't invite me in?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
That's my house.
It's a house.
Rita. Rita.
How do you know she is a witch?
I see.  Yes, of course.
You're using coconuts!
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
Well, how did you become king, then?
The same!
Oh!
What, "is"?
Stop that.
Hello.
Well, what are you then?
Ni!
What with?
Who are they?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
Too late.
Oh, shut up.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Good idea, O Lord!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Did you kill all those guards?
They cost fifty pounds each!
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Rather what?
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Where are you going?
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Quick!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Sir Gawain.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
How much?
She loved him.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
I wish to see my mother.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Mama...
I'm sorry?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
This is a slur on her good name.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Was there never ambition?
For Her Majesty.
Mr Brown.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
What are those?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
They're ready now.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
John?
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
We're going to lose.
Where did you find it by the way?
Unwell?
There is one other matter.
Ma'am?
Why is he not here?
How the hell did you do that?
But how can it change every time?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
No, in person.  Now.
Can you turn off the game?
Happy?
So how did it know my name, then?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Well?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
The Police, then...
You got the schematics?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Christ...no time...
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Mom?  You're alive...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
"Escape"?
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
And?
Beautiful night.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
... What??
So, what did they say?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
A car ... a car accident.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Is that it ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
McCay knows ?
What's the trick here ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
I... I .....
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Just stop it. End it here.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
Is it over ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
But, he's...
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When you are ready.
You did.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
Bruce has just awaken.
Look he figured it out !
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
I think we should follow him...
How's your foot ?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
He was right behind me !
Seriously.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Reason? What reason?
Maybe he's wet?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
What can I do for you?
This is really very nice of you.
He's writing. Hello?
Thanks....
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Boy, you're really into this.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Where are you going???
What's he smoking?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
What's it for?
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Something wrong?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Wanna play?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Can't you see it?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Uh huh?
You don't like it?
Well the other night at dinner...
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Kiss me.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
How's it going chef?
Did you ahh, love him?
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Really?
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
This is one big house for one single person.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
He's allergic to everything.
Maybe black means you're happy?
He won't give it to me.
Did you read ALL these books?
No.
I like my name.
NO!
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Hurry!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Hey look at this!
Is that your Dad?
Here.
Close your eyes.
Say something it's too quiet.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
You flew all the way h...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Two words.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
What else did he tell you...
Don't you have to be somewh...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
How about...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
I mean, he loves his job.
But he always says...
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, sure.
Please come, please.
She's too genuine.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Takes me back.
No accents today.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Does that make it right...
Thank God you were here.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
And to m...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
You going today?
Yes.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Where are you going?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
You bet.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
You in music?
What year?
Mom?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Bye.
Oh?
I'm twenty-eight
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
It's me. What is it?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Hello. John Triplette.
Where are you going?
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
What kind of pies do you have?
What did you think then?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Who isn't?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Who's the song bird?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Say something.
You guys stay on your bellies.
You ready, Donut?
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
It's gonna be beautiful.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Three.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
They done that too long in my family.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Don't say much, do you?
Thanks.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
I'm a teacher.
Yes, aren't you?
How come you stay 'round here?
Not here, Duff.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
What about that girl?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
How come you keep askin'?
Don't deny me, Duff.
You heard me!
Ain't you goin' to say something?
What you gettin' all pretty for?
See you, Duff.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
I asked you somethin', boy!
How you doin', boy?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Come back some other time, will you?
How 'you gonna live?
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Your Raoul?
Omar--
How long's it been?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What you lookin' for, mon?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
What are you talking about?
And then?
You ran without us.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
She's ready to go.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
You haven't got it?
I had to limit your options.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
Maybe something's onto him.
How long have I been out?
I gotta know... did it work>
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Yeah... fine.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Well excuse me.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
You don't think I can do it.
Okay. That's bad.
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Gus?
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
It's just for a couple of months.
What!?
No, I mean, no big whoop.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Whoa. Deja Vu.
I love the way she writes.
Sure, why?
Are you--scared?
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Please. Please don't walk away.
You ruined the whole thing!
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
By name.
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
Not at all!
Where're we taking him?
Taste it.
Taste it.
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Wanna join your little friend?
You remember your dreams, Grady?
What are you doing here?
Are you nuts or something?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Maybe we should call a doctor.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Horseshit.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
What are these, beauty marks?
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
I don't know...
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
That's right.
Stop blaming yourself.
Then maybe you're ready.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Who would know where they were hidden?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
Freddy.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Why is he after us?
I'm in.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Oh Jesus.
Coffee?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Busy tomorrow?
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Well...
Hi.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Yes.
Still loves you though.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Do you ever masturbate?
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Can I help you?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Oh my God...  Hello.
Spike.
Yes.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Which floor?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Yes, ma'am...
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
Yeah?
You men remain seated!
Welcome back.
I hope everything is settled.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
So long, kid.
Yeah, kid?
Say... God Bless America!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Wait a minute...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
I second the motion!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What? What?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Lobotomy!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
I'm the coach!
Hear what?
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Oh, what's that?
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
What's troubling ya, buddy?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
A dime.
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Please follow me.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
You're sure...
Who's dying?
There is one other thing you should know about me.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Damon Bradley...
Why can't you just tell me?
To the foot doctor.
He's out by the pool right now.
What?...
So were you.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
You okay?
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I was hoping for the real thing.
Well, to-- new friends.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
Live happily ever after.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
So?
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Faith--
That was really sweet...
Why?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
No.  No, you go ahead.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
And you are?...
A porco?
It's siesta.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
I came after the woman I love.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Right now?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
But my own kid bro
Working hard?
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
What the hell!!!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
It was you, Charley... .
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 
I think we're O.K.
In braids? That's right.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
It's quite  nice.
You haven't finished your beer.
Edie!
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Am I on my feet...?
I don't get it!
Now don't give me a hard time.
Give me that gun.
D 'n D?
You still call it ratting?
What do you think?
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
Do you?
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Maybe I will one of these days.
If I could get my hands on you...
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
I'm so frightened.
Those creatures..!
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
You do?
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
I would have time for my own pleasures!
You may take her now.
They are live ones?
No. No! No!
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
I said not as a rule.
What're you talking about?
Yes.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Where in the hell are we?
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
You tell your sister about it?
How long were you with the girl?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They found the safe.
You talked to him?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Daniel.  Listen --
You get the key?
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
The fuck you talking about?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Nervous?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
How many was that?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
You know who this is?
That's my dad.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
So.  What's your point?
You think he's lying?
Weren't you expecting us?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
There were others.
Take the next exit.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
You there?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You're not my type.
Moselle Miller?
No.
Was it Foley?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
I wish she could forget him.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Then why are you looking for her?
Sorry.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I heard what you did.
Win?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
What?...
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
I have'na been able ta --
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Do you believe in all of that?
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Where is it?
I'll call you Later.
I don't get it.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Charlie really has a great voice.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Yeah. Like that.
Right. I promised my mother.
What do you know about classical music?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
Oh, Charlie.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Are you for real?
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
It was Beth's idea.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I thought I knew everything about him.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Damn that Charlie I
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Hi, Dad.
Quiet today?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
I remember that dress.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Dancing with you.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
What a great kite.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I hear you moved into town.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I think so.
Who was that?
Just out.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
It's weird...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
How did it go with your father last night?
Allright. Calm down.
Thanks, Walter.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Jerk... What did you say?
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
Congratulations.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
You think I'm uncomfortable...
You survived your first gay party intact.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Particularly, Charles.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
A regular all-American guy?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Are you a good lawyer?
Thanks for coming by.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Yes.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Have you changed your aftershave?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
What, you're afraid?
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Hey.
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Little ratty-ass.
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Owens!
One is all?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
...then we saw this.
What the hell are these?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
Not a star-jumper.
Take it.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
I apologize.
Seal the cave?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Look -- she remembers.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
You didn't think so then.
'I am not a missing link.'
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Got your sensors?
No.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Objection!
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Landon! Join the expedition.
If only we could get a fix.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
What is that?
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Sustained.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Stop right there.
Twelve hundred years ago.
Tell him to pull back!
Sure.	In a cage.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
It's him...Landon.
Listen-
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
But the proof? The doll?
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Sarge?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Fuck this shit!
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
You volunteered for this shit man?
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
I didn't like it.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
Good evening, Miss.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Where's you get it?
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
What?
It was lying where on the balcony?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Got a moment, Inspector?
You in charge here?
Unless the gun was slanted up.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
So far.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
What's this?
How long have you had it?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
To Ann.
Thank you.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Are you going to have coffee?
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
I called you a taxi.
Me too.
Might?
Shall we have a drink or something?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Hello.
What period?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
It was last year.
We'll see what we can do.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Friends of yours, huh?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
What's this?
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
They don't go for the vault?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
Time for lunch.
Nothing?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Mean anything to you?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
What's got Billy so spooked?
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Where the hell is his body?
Georgia.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
I like your hat.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Who are you going after next, sir?
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
No, you look like a hooker.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
What's your name?
No, but it's getting there.
Better believe it.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Hello?
And that's the way the game is played.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
You still mad at'm?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
What if I lose it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
What did you do to him?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
I got tired of hating my father.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
What time's diner tonight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Why do you want to know?
You broke my nose.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
It was great.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
My Westley will always come for me.
Who are you?
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Why is that, do you think?
I only dog paddle.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Have you any money?
I brought you a special present.
What?
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Yes.
Who gets Humperdinck?
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
Now?
-- anything you want --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You are wonderful!
Because I know something you don't know.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I want to duel him left-handed.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Bye-bye, boys.
You feeling any better?
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Good, what is it?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
It won't run a week!
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Do you need us?
Min Bialystock.
The Blue Max...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You out to buy a motel?
No! Of all...
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
What's your interest?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
She stole some money.
I'm Mary's sister.
What should I know?
I was getting to that!
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
You want me to stay here?
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
A man should have a hobby.
I'm looking for a private island.
You should... mind it.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Thank you, Norman.
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
We have a problem.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll get your bags.
Looking for me?
Satisfied with your cabin?
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Was that all?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
No-
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
You here again?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
Yes, why?
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
There's no hurry. It's early.
I think so.
I won't let you say that!
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Are you giving me this straight?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Which one is me? The horse?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Make it snappy, Colonel.
I told you he was a sore.
That's what I said.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
How much money have you got?
What is it? What happened?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
I've been dreaming about you.
What?
We flopped the first time out.
What did it want?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Yes?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I know, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Actually, I am, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Here comes Daddy.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Yeah, I know.
I do, too!
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
What'd you say, Brother?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
Boys? You say to me boys?
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
How is she?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Rose, what are you doing up?
You're so sweet.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Rose, you don't have to.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
You shouldn't litter.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Where you gonna be?
Wh... what... ?!
What's the plan?
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
Happy Independence Day.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
That's him alright.
Where we going?
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Yeah... great.
You know what I mean.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
What... ?  Not you too?
That's not true.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
What the hell's his problem?
You suck at lying, Archie.
We're screwed.
Why the beach?
I don't think so.
You see that?
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
There's still good in him.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Han!
Luke.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Yes.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Here we go again.
Proper?!
What did he say?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet!
Janet.
Yes Brad.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Good God.
You're OK by me.
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
...Aren't you skating?
What's funny?
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
D'you really wanna call?
They're all the same.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Don't you open them anymore?
...Like you?
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
He won't last one round.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
Few minutes?
A hundred an' thirty.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Excuse me.
Make your teeth yella --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
More like thirty.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Think about it.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
What's happened is freak luck.
How 'bout a glass of water?
...What?
Ya nose is broke.
How I look out there, Mick?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Why?
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
They must've taken it off me.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
How did you get onto Doom?
What's with the dip?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Wrong number?
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Is the day so young?
Out--
Good heart, at what?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Good marrow, father!
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
I take thee at thy word.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
That dreamers often lie.
Pink for flower.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Why did you do that?
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I don't know.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Not to me, you know that.
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
I better be getting that.
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I'd stake my reputation.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
He's company.
We'll die if we stay here!
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
I ride with fat-boy...
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
He says this is their block.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
He's going back.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Alright, it's done.
It is at that.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
What happened to it?
Do you have the tape?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
What are we going to do?
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
Shhh!
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
You said that last time!
Not bad enough to kill him.
Here it is.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
OK.  I love you.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
A satellite dish?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
She's not his type.
Hey where's the hot pad?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Dwayne please calm down!
I'll settle for a third of that.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Are you hungry?
That's great Earl!
Don't you want it?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
You think he skipped town?
I got my sources.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How'd you know?
What?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Hello.
What are you doing?
Goddamn you got a small ass.
You.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Pick it up!
Fine.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
And that, of course, would be me.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
What about them?
You make the plate?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
That's not how it goes.
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Any demands yet?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Got any last minute advice?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Fisher, let him talk.
In vino veritas.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Get this man a Kamikaze.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
What?
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
Where did you disappear to?
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
I love you.  I love you.
Used?
I'm listening.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Ya think?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
Nope.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Happy New Year, darling.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I told you.  Nothing --
You okay?
You should write something about this.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
He lost all the weight... there.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
I love you, too.
I love that dream.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Go home for the weekend.
Please --
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Sure you do.
Hello.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
What are you going to do, Sam?
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Write her.
Dad --
Not.
What?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
Great.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
I can't believe you flew first class.
Do you like baseball?
What about camping?
Do you like it?
You look good.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
He's ten.
Well?
You haven't tried locking them up!
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Forgot what?
Lus! Come down here!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Who wouldn't?
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
What?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
What do you want from me, Colette?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
My features. They're Finnish.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
By not disgracing her memory!
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
But I just met you.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I'm sorry?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Now get talkin'
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell is this?
What the hell are you doing here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
What's on the other end of this thing?
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Excuse me?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Yes, sir.
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
That must be four thousand yards.
Jackson?
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Not yet.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Worked, didn't it?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And how do you bluff yourself?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Uh, oh.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Who cares?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
Speak with my lawyer.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
I'll take the whole set.
Yes.
So, what's your point?
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Wait a minute.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
I'm sorry.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Lloyd?
What happened to you?
I swear to god.
Hello.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Busy?
Whoa.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Me?  Sure I do.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
We'll see.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What?
Okay.
You're freaking out here man.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Ooop, excuse me.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
It's not a charade, all this?
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
You're not telling me something.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
Like this?
What's wrong with it?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Thank you.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
Pots and pans.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
Four hundred, four fifty -
We need to talk.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
Can't we hold him?
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
Yes.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I don't think that's a good idea.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Where is Sidney's father?
But youll never get away with it.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
This is exactly what I don't want.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
She's got guards with her.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
We had to have financing.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Let's go.
Dewey?
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Who is this?
No, wait...
I dont know.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
That was good.
Can I come with her?
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
I hate scary movies.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
What are you talking about?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
Hmm.
You're not a detective.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Hello.
Who's this?
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Hello?
Owwww...
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
I thought she was dead.
My dad's in the other room.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
What did you say?
Yes?
Listen, asshole...
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Where are you?
I wanna play a game.
Then he dies. Right now.
But you're doing so well.
Afraid not.
You tricked me...
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
She staying with you?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Where is she?
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Stu was with me last night.
Don't come any closer.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
No way.
That's mature.
How's that?
You've left unfinished business before.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Somerset...
It could be nothing.
It's too soon for him.
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
No witnesses of any kind?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
How was it?
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sorry about that... I just...
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
What are you going to say?
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
Slut.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
You askin' me to clear out now?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
I didn't give any order to fire!
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
How'd you come by this?
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Keep talking.
You want us to fire a shot if...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Stay out here.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Was your niece about their age?
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
They never find that girl.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Might at least have left me my pants!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
I'll do it myself.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
She was old.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ohwhat have I done?
What do you want, Kit?
Tomorrow.
Wait!  Will you desist!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
Are you writing?
How much?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Will it restore my gift?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Nobody. The author.
Kit
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
What is the story?
The daughter of his enemy.
"But new struck nine."
"Out."
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
What do you love so much?
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Master Shakespeare
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Can you love a fool?
Moonlight!
Oh, do not go
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
I know how to fight!
Will! What--?
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Nono.
But all ends well.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
She loves me, Thomas!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
What's his name?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
That was good.
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
How much?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Not eating what?
Don't know what?
That's it, then.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Did you know --
I'm not usually drunk.
Unfeasible.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Be careful.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
We could put it somewhere.
Downstairs.
No, nothing, sorry.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Two hundred pounds.
Who have you talked to?
I thought you'd gone to work.
What do we do here, David?
In this firm.
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
What's it about?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
Same as everyone else.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I just thought you'd like to know --
Thanks a lot.
She's got a...
I can see that.
I know.
That headboard.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Are you in love with her?
Then it's not your problem.
Shit.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
No shit.
Right now?
So you want to go in business for yourself?
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
George!
Jesus...
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Why not?
Did you?
You know what I'm talking about.
Baby...
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- you are.
-- sure.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
-- ass and legs --
-- Jesus --
Where are you going?
God, there's Lester...
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- took a bus.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
I just... who what?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
No, but I think they might.
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
How come you took your own car?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Yes.
Obviously.
Baby, don't do this --
-- yes.
George...
George, now cut this out.
No.
It's good you want to do something, George.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Well anyway...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Sit down.
I mean, how did that happen?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Fine.
I am? I mean why?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
You're kidding.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
Call me Les.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Are you having a good time?
Yes?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Dad?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
I don't know.
Room 237?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Mom?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Red Rum.
Mommy!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
No.
Who?
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
No, we don't mind.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Have any trouble finding us?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Can I tell you kids something?
Please, Uncle Al.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Well... was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
It could have been anything, Marty.
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
Really.
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Is this... choir practice?
Two days.  An hour or so.
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
You have to help me
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
The reason?
And all those like you.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
In English?
So... hi there.
You're my Olympic event.
But... wait a minute...
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Hey, girls.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
It's done?
Right.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
You didn't shoot!
What's she doing?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Reverend Mother?
Who took the meat?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Stains of blood.
It is sacrilege!
Your superiors are two days away!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
What is the common thread between these victims?
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
What is it?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What now?  Where is she?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
You promised justice.
Blood.
My God... what has happened?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Can you help?
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
All right then.
Thank ye.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Leave.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Sure, I guess.
You believe in the Bible?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
But maybe just for awhile --
What are all them books?
Don't you live somewhere?
They let you out?
Do you like to play football?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Who did you kill?
You want to go with me?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
What do you mean?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Why?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Huh?
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
You scared me.
Thank ye.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Where will he go?
Yes.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Like me, too.
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
And what about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's yours?
How'd you get started?
A photographer ...
I've never seen anything like it.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
You usually get two.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
She looks just like you.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
And you're giving it to me?
There's just one thing I want to know.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
So I can get my job back.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Hi there, little brother.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Mostly what.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Two or three nights.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Fries?
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
I don't know.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
I did.  Boy.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
That's when he fell.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
What happened?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
My name is Josephine.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Oh, he does!
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
WHAT?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Sugar?
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
She sings, too.
You all right?
How's the bottle?
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
What do you think you're doing?
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
I'm a what?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Yeah - Josephine.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
Did he get fresh?
You must be quite a girl.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Daphne...
Anything today?
What's the job?
Because I got some plans -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
We got it second-hand.
Put it here.
Then why did you take this job?
Rough?
That so?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
How's the stock market?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
You collect shells?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
I seem to be out of gas.
Love it.  Which way?
Oh - in here.
Look at all that silverware.
Where's your shell collection?
What's on Thursdays?
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
I don't want to bore you.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Anything this time?
Well - ?
I never knew it could be like this.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
What'll it be, sir?
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Hey.
Does Kat know?
Huh?
Whats going on with you two?
I didnt deserve her back then.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Youre not even listening.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
You quitting?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Are you sure?
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Like fifteen.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Not yet...
I am now, sir.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
What about Sounder?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
And so you did your job, right?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
But, Charlie --
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Who is they?
Any sign of Sounder?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
Who's Miss Johnson?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
How's the weather out there?
Well, let's get to work!
There, you see?
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
What is this?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Who the hell made up that law?!
Come on, just get to the message board!
Your behind?
Mph rm rmph!!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
The N word?
You bastards.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Mrph?
That's gonna take a long time!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Oh, brother.
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
But I-
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Ow, you're hurting me!
You don't have watches?
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
I think I can handle it.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Really?
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
You're ready for the real thing?
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean?  What happened!
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
What is it?!
Thank you.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
What is happening around here!!!
Carlo!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
How is it looking, Mac?
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
- canker sore.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Who gave it to you?
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
What did you do to Buzz?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Why were you suspended?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
You told Junior that we did it.
He's dead Sheila.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Hold on --
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
Norman, please!  Don't!
Then why am I here?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
Harry's missing.
But sir --
You don't want to know.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
She wired this system.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
You're next, Norman.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
But I don't know how --
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
The refridgerator.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
A synthetic opium analogue.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's like a sleeping pill?
You ever given an injection before.
How do you feel about snakes?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
That's when you went in the sphere.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Then where's it coming from?
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Just in time, too.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is it coming from our own computer?
How are you feeling, Norman?
Our answer.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
What is that?  That noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Missed.
C'mon, Norman!
Well, press something!
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
What does Norman already know?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
What kind of a crash was it?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Was it a military crash?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
How much do you think she's talking about?
You saw through me?
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Are you all right?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
The Kiber Crystal.
Have you been checked out?
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Watch it!  Move back.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
No, this hurts.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
How do you make him do that ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Are you the boy for me ?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
You're late.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
How bad are you, pal ?
What is your position ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>...?!
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Captain, what's the next move?
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Viewer ahead.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Child...!?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I have one, but they lost it.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
But why the dalmation?
You get what you pay for.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
...who...?
I <u>can</u>?
I...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Later on.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Why?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
...and we could get up every morning...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
And I might have something important to tell you...
I wasn't doing business.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Well, where do they hold court?
He's on the ph...
They think it's your First Wife...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
The prices are going up.
What else?
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What I...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I know that...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
...I know...I know...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
That's cor...
-- she's got 'religion.'
Where you off to?
...he's the producer of the movie.
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Hi.
I'm looking for the writer.
My wife's going to have a baby.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I...?
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I can't.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
No, what is it?
How was your flight?
Marty...
She wasn't in...you were al...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
She coulda done better than him.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
How would you know sh...
I hope it's the right kind.
I can't hear you.
Actually.  I could only help him.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What if he's kidnapped?
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
You think this is funny?
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
You know, this horse smells really bad.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Queen of diamonds.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Rachel's job is she works.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
And when did that pass?
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
So we'll...radiate some more?

I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's a huge moment in their life --
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
What happens next?
Yeh?
...in.
However many.  It's not enough.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.

And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...

Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
Why didn't I?
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
But?  But what?
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
No problem.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Why in the world would she t...
I needed some time away.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
No prob. I'm cool.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
But really, you never know.
This is definitely better.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
It's all about who you know.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
I can read it to you.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
What DO you know?
The same. Same as what?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
You know...I like you.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Prnceton.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I said I'll lead.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Are the labs in operation?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Good.
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Drop the anchor!
Get your men to do it!
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
I see.
I guess so.
Where, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
They can't touch us at this height.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
So am I.
What does it look like?
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Second safety.
Master safety.
Yes, Major.
Can't "Ace" help you?
Where'd they get you?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
I'm okay.  What's up?
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Forget it.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
We are?
Um-hm.
Can I have some?
In Group?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Slides go with it.
Uh-huh.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
No I quit.
Yup.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
A long, long, long, long, while.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
I know, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
Hey, man.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Oh, you were in the band?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Yes! Free concert!
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Yeah, we're all above that.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Hi.
Can you tell me what happened?
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff, stay there.
Why we're just standing here.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
Please?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
Of course I do!
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
How?
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Where are you going?
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
You really suck, you know that?
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Your manager?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Let me explain something...
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Yeah?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
What the hell do you want?
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Roll 'em.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Name dropper.
If I could be of any help...
Hurt feelings department.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
I was afraid of that.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
May I say you smell real special.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
You bet.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Gordon Cole?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Just a minute, you!
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You'll like it here.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Don't bend back like that.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Keep it.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
How did it go?
That's a lie!  They still want me!
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
That's what I told them.
Got a title?
Paramount is calling.
Paramount studios.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
A Storm Dragon?
Home?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
Let me kiss you.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Is this how?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?
Why should I believe you?
Nurse! Nurse!
No!
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Guess! Go on.
Hey, where you going?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
There isn't any.
I'd rather not talk about it.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
What can I do for you?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I was on Earth...
Shouldnt've done that.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
That horrible woman!
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Not enough vodka in it.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
You know what's the problem?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Peanut butter and jelly.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Well, aren't you excited?
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Dishwasher? Any luck?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Columbia.
When?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
A computer.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
How you doing down there?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
I know, by computers.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Ricky?  Where...what...
The picture looks blurry.
I thought you'd never get here.
I can't see anything.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Small potatoes.
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Lois, what are you doing?
I don't?
Maybe I could try --
It is kinda romantic.
A "complimentary corsage."
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Where were you?
I was right. you are Superman.
I'm listening.
I want to.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Hi.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
But . . ..that's terrible!
Does Lois know about this yet?
What??
Why didn't you go before we left?
I think he said a "curl."
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
DELETE IN CUTTING
Superman! The --
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
You are master of all you survey.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Well, I don't understand.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I think there's an angle.
What's that?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
You think he'll find us.
But . . . how could you beat him?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
A hot story, huh?
Are there any more at home like you?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Super...man. Hmmm...
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
You and your real estate.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Meteorites!
Don't let me down.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Boy!
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
What color underwear am I wearing?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Is that real enough for you?
Sort of.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
And what does he do again?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
She's in trouble?
I...don't think so.
I understand.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
Because it's what we have to do.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Have you been waiting long?
Your kids never cry.
Good night, Billy.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
He knows that?  Billy?
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Nicole?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Do you have a room?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Have they ever been busted?
Is this it?
I'm in a car wash.
We do.
I'm a lawyer.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
What time in the morning was this?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What do you mean?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
Sidney is a liar!
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
He means that much to you...?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
And where was his wife?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
J.J., if you think -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
You haven't told him yet...
I can't
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Not even of dying?
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Drive for a minute.
Will it melt in there?
No!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
They took him from me.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Are you afraid?
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
What?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
You do shorthand and typing?
What's in those files?
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
I'm sorry.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
And ask him about his private life.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Alright, the beige one.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
So much pain.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
Give me the short version.
Call her.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
I'll give you a boost.
Please...
You're the one who started running.
Never did catch your name.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Where are we going?
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
What do you think you're doing?
What the fuck are you... ?
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Happy Birthday, man.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Trust me.  Call that number.
It doesn't matter...
How do you mean, exactly?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
Oh... it's a game.
May I make two suggestions... ?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
I've been so lonely.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Is everything alright?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
What gentleman, Maria?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
What's happened...
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
You're not telling us something.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
Nell!
Are you working with her?
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Like she smelled it too?
What'll happen to us, Nell?
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Oh God, we can't get out!
That's where she hanged herself.
What do you do?
I love this house.  I really love this house.
Good night, Theo.
David.
Why?
Are you sure?
Nell, what happened?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Am I a thing?
Anything but Japanese.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
We think someone is here.
No.
What kind?
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Boomerang.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
What?
That was one of them?
Steady on.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Didn't get it.
Why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
Oh, it just ended, then.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Modelling.
When did you get in?
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Fancy it?
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
It was you.  Downtown.
Where is he now?
You sure?
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What?
Hello there.
Is he here?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Tell you ...
Ann--
...I stank, didn't I?
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...No, please.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
You got the dough?!
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
How much to they want, Dave?
What kind of man *are* you?
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
...Doris--
How did you get into the store?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
Mr...?
...I'm Crane.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
Behind you.
Fifteen... what's next?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
It's still back there!
What's that?
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
I'm coming with you.
Dr. Frock?
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
How many storage areas are there?
Where is that?
You work here?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
How does it work?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Where would we find it?
Dr. Green...
What was it?
Wounded?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
It's the busy season.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
The creator of what?
What's he doing?
Why not?
No...I, er.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
I think I'm mixed up in something.
How did it go today?
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
What am I doing here?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
No, they don't.
Who?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
That would be my guess.
You didn't know my father --
Mulder -- it's me --
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Where are you, Mulder?
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
What did you find?
What kind of infection?
You said you weren't coming?
He didn't mention a park.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
Where would they be going?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
Scully --
Cold...
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
A virus?
Where is he?
More concerns than that?
Sing a song of sixpence...
He hates me.
She adores you.
Miriam...
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
What about Julia?
You think you can do this, don't you?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Into Stargher.  Inside...
Nervous?
How is she?
You sure you want to go through with this?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Harry?
...and buried him.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
...you know.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Are you going, too?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
How do you know?
...anyway?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You can help us.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I said another man was buried in his place.
Where?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
My name is Calloway.
You a friend of Lime's?
...expense.
Miss Schmidt.
Fifty yards right down there.
It's a military hotel.
You do!
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Seems exciting.
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
...you know and all that.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
...you.
...the best way one can, you know.
Thank you.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Already gone.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...Popescu...
...give evidence.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Passport, please.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
You think?! Based on what?
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Your father??
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
An investment banking house.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Give me a reason not to.
I don't think you know what you are.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
Don't tell me what I --
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
What part of Germany are you people from?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Hello...?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Not too fast.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
You can't say that....
Howard Stern.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Do you think I...
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Does he know?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Did the driver really freeze?
No!
You're right.  You're fired.
This is a great pleasure.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Jacques!  Johana!
Dollars.
Enzo, wake up!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
I dove 315 feet!
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
You still collect them?
Can I come in?
He doesn't like us.
No!  I would never cheat you.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
You jumped in?
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
I'd better get back now.
I'm going back home.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
What are you doing?
Why?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
Well?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
So, how was I?
Get off of me you cripple!
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Mmmyes.
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
Then what do you do?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
Don't look at it!
The death card - -
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, I'd best be off.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Then you found the leopard --
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
You're too good to me.
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Thats right.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
Laurence!
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
Hi...
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Ever seen him before?
So you havent seen the film, then?
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Vous tes Franais?
Am I supposed to know him?
Five to three. Youre early.
Evening. Table for one?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Its wet. Will this do?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
Is she on the phone?
Whats the date?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Mon bureau cotait trop cher.
Alors?
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Why did you kill him?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Mossad?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
And I would like to see a priest.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Better today than tomorrow.
Jeanne, stop it!
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
What did the king say?
No, but...
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
But that was her order!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
And?
Why?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
The voice was in your cell?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
You will??
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Your majesty, I really think you...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Well...?  Shall we go?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
And... what does Jeanne think?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Besides, what about these...?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
What are you doing out here?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Are you going to leave me too?
You think you are ready now?
My father's.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
A beauty. Who is she?
Who are you?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
Dorota!
Don't worry, it won't last long.
How long have you been married?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
Halina?
We're recruiting.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
And suppose they take the table away?
What's this about?
Boys, boys...
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
How long have you been here?
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Szpilman.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
No, it was a table.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
And when is the next lesson?
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
There's always a depression on.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
You think he'll show?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
What time you get off work here?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
No.
You want a drink or something?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Cheer up, darling.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Well!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
No.
Then what are you hiding?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Not that scrawny little....? 
How did you ever remember me?
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
Come on in.
There. 
Don't lie to me.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
You can take that out to the car.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Have you got a pistol permit?
So would I.
No proof?
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
You mean that body-----?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Where were you?
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Did you get my money?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Dorothy!  Is she here?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
You might have mentioned me first.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
I never saw that before.
Aren't you hot in that?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
How did you get in here?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I just wanted to tell you...
Where were you going?
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
He's not so--
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Missile!
You got no reason to do that!
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
What!?  What!?
They'll shoot us!
What?
You can't tell anybody about this.
SAY IT!
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
I don't hear any--
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
X marks the spot.
Wes might be right about that.
First Wes, now you?
And you; you've got it all together.
Epps?
I don't want to die.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Well?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Slip out your M-16.
...Wes...?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Well?
How do we do that?
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
He says it's a box.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
Yeah!  Yeah!
I thought we were dead.
Epps...
Is there anything you do know?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Maybe we should give him some water.
I think he wants something to drink.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
When?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
What?
What's going on?
You're in violation.
Right now.
...and you're not lost now?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
That's not it.
Yes
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
May I help you?
They're not here.
And you are...?
Coffee, Mike?
What was-? Why...?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Only once, at Redstone.
So what were they doing here?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I terrible with mechanical things.
It's working.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Computer device?
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
What the hell was that?
What the hell's going on?
Vice... Jesus.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Oh shit...
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Next week we work the park.
You don't fish.
A what?
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
No!
Yes!
And harems ... ?
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I don't want to see you at all!
You can trust me.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Please.
Monescu!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
They're all right, aren't they?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Do you know my first name?
Eighteenth century.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
The same thing.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Yes, I would!
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Adolph J. Giron.
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Two lumps, madame?
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
Then why did you do it?
How much time?
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
There's a satellite call for you.
None of the stewards have seen her.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
You told me to change.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Is this in any way unclear?
You're precious to me, Rose.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
The boats are all going.
Why have we stopped?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
No you won't.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I'm Jack Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Now it's worse.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Rose, get in the boat!
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Isn't she lovely?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Will you pardon me?
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
You've got lipstick all over you.
This is Mr.--er--
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
What?--
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
You don't think--?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
I thought you were a sucker--
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Here you are, sir. 
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
What?
That's me!
Hello, Denby!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
McKinney's the name.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Why--don't you like him?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Well, he has a straw hat--
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
Can you read 'em Jack?
He's all right.
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
He's certainly good-natured.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Oh, my God...
So how's Tombstone treating you?
What d'you think of the singer?
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
I want them spitting blood!
I'm retired.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Since when is faro a business?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
You really look awful.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
What's wrong?
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Really?  You sure?
Mattie.  What about this?
Well how do we look?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
It's that woman from the coach!
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Yeah?
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
We should get moving.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I'd rather die alone.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
His newspapers?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
It must do something.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
That's reassuring.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Sidney Winch, meet -
They point, I shoot.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
Do I have to do everything around here?
Down?
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
And number two?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
I pay my own way.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Since this morning.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
How is he doing?
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
How many people do you all feed?
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Did you have your child at home?
What must I do?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
What's going on?
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Shhhhhhh!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
There.
Hey, Slinky?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Woody!  Speed up!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
You're only a young thing.
Who's there?
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Surely she is older?
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I... I don't really know.
What is he planning on telling them?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
Did you get it?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
I think she's lying.
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Are you going to?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
In school?
How are your grades?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Yes, mom --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
What do we do?
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
Yes.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Hello.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
OK. Same again?
What?
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Come on.
I don't see why not.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So, what's he like?
What happened?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Who wrote it?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Yeah.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Say something, Mark, say something --
It was my fucking television.
How much?
That's tough.
Excellent.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
A walk.
Homeless people?
Qual se tu?
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
But the shuttle-
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Bob?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Where did you get this power?
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
And that is?
Jim.
I could use a shower.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
We must change our course at once.
I trust your message was received?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
You are mad!
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Spock?
I don't understand...
Hi, Alan.
How's it going upstairs?
Did he say why?
I want to go to his place.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm your program?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That was uncalled-for.
Dumont!
What, just the three of us?
What's that?
How about over there...that empty memory?
You're alive!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
Then...
Hey... you guys OK?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Feel what? You okay?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
What is it?
Nice...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Station wagon?
Just hang a minute.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
She's still at my house.						*
Now what?
He's got it.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
Yes.
I think so.
Natasha?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
What did he give you?
What is it?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
Who's your little friend?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
What's going on, Harry?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
You got that playing basketball?
Tell him to look through it.
Sonny kicks ass.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Four hundred bucks.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
No no no no no no no no no...
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Why Cancoon?
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Who the fuck are you?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
This shit can't be real.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Do you really mean it?
I'd fuck Elvis.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
What do you think, eightball?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
You got it all worked out, don't you?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Could we try it now?
Where'd he come from?
He'll wear a wire?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Or a bit player -
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You gotta hold this for me.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
How do you know? You been there?
Yes.
No, sir!
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
We're very close!  Because of you!
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Change what?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
They're keeping an eye on me.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
The guy was a total fruitcake.
You smell so good.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
He was fully sedated!
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Any parting words of wisdom?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Hey!
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
It's nothing.  Really.
Yes, I have.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Have you ever been there before?
Is it pretty?
Jake.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Let's do it here.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Are you all right?
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
Live there?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Nice office you've got.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You meant it.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
What should I do?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Jake--
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Hell no!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Say, what happened to your hand?
I'm a solid man.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Would you?
What can I do for you, lad?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Got any requests?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Nothing.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Where you coming from?
What do you do anyway?
My face tell you all that?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You never did answer my question.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Where?
In <u>cash</u>?
I wanted to talk.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I'm not sailing his boat.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
"Arkady"
I need a ticket.
One way, or round trip?
Beck's.
Heineken?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Let me get your change.
Anybody hurt?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Would you like to try going--
What about the game?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
I don't know what you're asking?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Are you finished?
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
Yeah?
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'm going to work out.
What do you do if something happens?
I'm sleeping in my room.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Rain's coming.
He said...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He's coming ain't he?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He give 'em names?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Uh... a little, maybe.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
What's all that wood?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
That much, huh?
Like I said, I...
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Ned's share?
Who killed him?
A sign on him?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Get some sleep, Kid.
Did you kill him?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
They takin' water?
Yup.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
He hit you?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY.
HEY, KID.
I seen him.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
What is it, son?
Hullo, paw.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Did you... did you... ?
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Fuck you.
Well, suppose he does?
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
They just said they wanted time.
I love you.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
He's alright.
Get out.
Don't hurt me.
What do you mean I can't see him?
I'11 find him.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Mr. Abraham...
What did he find?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Anything special about the case?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Ed Concannon.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Mr. Concannon...?
You would not...?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am seventy-four years old.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Dr. Thompson...?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
Yes.
Thank you ...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
D'you find an apartment?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Uh ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
...I have to stand up for her...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Been a long time, huh...?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
What happened, Joey...?
Are you with me...are you awake...?
What the hell are you doing here?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
Like all this.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
How can I see her, to know her?
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
What do you want to know?
Judy Barton.
It's a place to live, that's all.
Mmm.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
The color of your hair...
That's what I had in mind.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, why are we here?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Please drink your coffee.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
One shouldn't live alone.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Meet again, sometime.
Have you been here before?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
What do you remember?
Would you know the room?
How do you know?
Tell me.
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Where?
Madeleine --
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
How's your love life, Midge?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
The poor thing....
I've told you enough.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
She died.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
The stripper's here.
How ya doing?
You're an asshole Adam.
Why?
Don't even start.
What are you doing?
Just stop.
Her fucking head was caved in.
We can't do this.
So that's what we're doing.
You got us into this mess.
We'll be ready Adam.
Are you solid with that?
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Have you thought about what I said?
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
I don't think so Boyd.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
Easy Boyd.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
Whatever you say Kojak.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
Not true.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
What else have you forgot?
He is.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
Charles Moore for instants.
Do you love me?
Keith do not trivialize this.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
You go down there.
I need your help.
Take care of those chairs.
Do you love me?
Yeah. Sure.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
That's a good one.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
I'll come to you tonight.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Are there many windows?
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Enedina and Paco ...
Was that difficult to get?
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
What do you mean?
You must think I am a monster.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
You believe me, don't you?
Is it all right?
How much is that?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
What's the matter with you?
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
What are you thinking about?
And this chest?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Is she coming back?
It's for people!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
You cannot leave ...
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Have I slept long?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
I should have told him.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Think you can do it?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
What did Cox pull him out early for?
What the hell happened?
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I don't need a babysitter.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
You know I am.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Which way?
See something?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
...tonight...
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
...this is a snappy song....
...The Albanian Campaign...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What crisis?
<u>Do</u> it...
What is it?
...the... 
...you want us to go to War...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Why is this putz on the air...
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Give'em another pill...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
Stanley, you can't do this....
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
We're due at Andrews. 
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Ask it.
Would you go to War to do that? 
...Yes.
China.
Do I know you?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
Who?
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
...who is this guy...?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
I think it's fine?
In the Folk Music Section.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
An anti-psychotic...
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
Show Must Go On.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
I have the White House on the Line.
Public Domain.
I didn't ask for a dog.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...by you?
Why a beret?
A wider option of what?
Just want to take a nap.
...mmm.
... That's what you told us to say.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
What the hell do you want?
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Where is it?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
...isn't it perfect!
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
How you doing Buddy?
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
You told him about us?
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
He still likes you
But?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
And uh, your nicotine sir
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Can I give her a message?
Oh that explains everything.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
That was very good.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
I started seeing things.
Did you?
What?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Of course.  You must be so proud.
How're you holding up?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Tell me.  Please.
Tell me.  I can help you.
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
No, I don't.
What's your name?
He was so pissed.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
It's niiice.
Nothing's happening.
Then what was it?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
I'm a terrible friend.
I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Jody he was lying.
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire?
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
It's just us now.
Remember how we were?
I think so.  Maybe.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Get down!  He'll see.
Dressed?
What are you doing?
Who did?
How did you--
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
You know I am.
You dropped a glass.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
...I'm positive this time...
Ow!
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Claire, please don't...
I never asked you to quit!
How can you be sure?
Do you know it?
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
What?
:Would you stop it!
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
There is no one here but the dead.
Do not tell me that!
Only you...
I do not understand...
They like you ------- kids.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Too much... too fast...?
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
What about your work back home...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
You sure...?
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Wanna snack...?
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
You did that, didn't you...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Hi.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
When could I look round?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
This must be one of the old keys -
Do you take sugar?
What are you doing?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
I don't know
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
What didn't you like about her?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
What?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
Her husband left her
That's good
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You got everything you ever wanted.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
Well?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Whatever helps you cope.
Sorry I--
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
Can you believe that was me?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
James, what are you doing here?
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
I miss them, too.
He was my Grandfather, too.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
It's all so complicated.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
Well? Surprised?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You called the cops on us?
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
In a hurry, are we?
My parents? What do you mean?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
How quaint.
Talk to me Artie.
Merritt, Forensics.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
I don't know what to say...
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Where's the body?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
No.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
What did you do then?
Ms. Toller?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
I say something funny?
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I'm running away.
But check this...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Davy.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
Sam...
That was about as grim as it gets.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
At least I tried something.
Thank you.
This is good.
It is?
What's this?
What is that?
I know!  I know!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
He's not giving up?
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
My.  It's gotten longer.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Now it's a bomb.
When are they coming?
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
You left me to die, friend.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
I do what I'm told.
Then you get us out of here.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
She's a bird, Willow.
I don't know, Willow.
Who are you!  Who are you!
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
Get back here, Rool!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
She's hungry.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Are you really ever coming back?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Who else knows?
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
The... bullets?
You know carpentry?
What else can you do?
You're so sure of that?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
It's me.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
...has been simply unbearable.
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Um-hmm.
Oh -- Oh --
Dorothy next!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
You humbug!
No, her dog!
...junk!
...of the West.
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
How can I ever thank you enough?
You new?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Constructions not exactly my line.
Old friend?
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.
Beautiful, isnt it?
Does this look familiar to you?
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
I dont want to be safe!
What are you talking about?
...what?
I could have given you the world.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Mother of God.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Jon --
Who?
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
His what?
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
Dan -- what do we do now?
So do I.  So do you.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
I'm terribly sorry.
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are you?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Aren't you afraid?
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Did you do your homework?
Where's he headed?
Toadies right behind.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Nice hops.
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What's wrong with him?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Where are we going?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
MMMmm!
Love me oodles and oodles?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Promise??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Does that mean you love me?
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Darling!?!
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Well... we'll see.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
What?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
There.
I thought you wanted to.
Did you hear that strange music?
What a filthy job!
I want that brain.
Throw the second switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
No, no!  That whole thing!
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
Yes, Master!
How's it going?
Where is he?
All right -- where is she?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
There's only one way.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
What's that tune that you're playing
Did you have a pleasant trip?
A god?
Give him the sedative!
Just passing through the night.
Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
Yes, I will.
No, not sound.
How do you know they're done?
How long is it so far?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
