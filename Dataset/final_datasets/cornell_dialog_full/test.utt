I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Hi.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Wow
She okay?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Who is she?
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Will Bogey get bent?
You told me that part already.
Yeah
You need money to take a girl out
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
It's about time.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
You and Verona?
What's this?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Pick you up Friday, then
You hate me don't you?
You're not a big talker, are you?
Like you could find one
Dorsey.
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Then you screwed up
You up for it?
State trooper?
What?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Why can't we agree on this?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What?!
I missed you.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
He's the devil's child...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Are we going to argue?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
Chief knows.
Chief says -- how many?
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
... Into a monk...
Don't say anything.
...delusions and paranoia.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
I will if they don't send me back.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
Oh.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Sorry...PD only.
What's wrong?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My folks are.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Two heads.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Eddie, are you okay?
Hey, honey.
Stop it.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Okay.  You ready?
And what do you do with the bones?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
In here, says he wants a million.
Did you hear what I said?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
What?
Speak English!
Get in the bathroom!
Let me get a shot of it.
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Emil???!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I'm trying to tell you.
Yes...he's my friend.
New York.
A cheap hotel.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
What?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
How was it?
What are you gonna do?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
CONTINUED
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Really.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
How?
Good morning. How's it going?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
When are you coming home?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Thank you.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
That's true
Roger.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Yeah?
Name?
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
I hear you've got visitors.
You lying son of a bitch...
Yeah, I noticed...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
No way to start a partnership.
Yeah.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Hey, this works pretty good.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
There.
They saved your ass, convict.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Where's luther?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Hey, how'd my car get here?
You okay?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Yeah?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
I'm all wet.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
How do you know?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Three more hours...
Who the hell are you?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
How about some ammo?
Five.  On credit.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
What're you laughing about?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
...We're saved!
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...would you like a drink?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Hello?
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
When EVIL returns so shall we.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Is that all?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
It's my wife.
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You noticed..
Where you going?
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
At least I won lunch.
Talk English Doc.
This thing solid?
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What are you talking about?
A fellow investor.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Friend of yours?
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
What the fuck are you.. ?
I'm gonna kill you.
How much did he pay you?
Do it.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Give me the film.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
You're learning.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He succeeded.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
How are you?  Having any luck?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
Yes... ?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
Are you religious?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
How... how can you say that to me...?
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
Yes... I remember Mary
Do you know what happened to her?
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I've been working double shifts.
How long have you been awake?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Feeling better now?
I gotta get out of here.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
There you go.  Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
How was the meeting?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
They think I'm nuts.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
How is he - ?
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Yeah?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Is there any way out of it?
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
But - what can we accomplish?
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Who?
What are you boys up to?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
You see it?
Guaranteed, eh?
You might not kill it.
I used to play ball.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Safety on?
Like you and Gordon?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
I'm fucking out of here.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
What then?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
You don't want the extra police pay?
What's the hurry?
You? Why?
The key, Wade.
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
See. Get your boots.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You okay?
Call me.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Oh, Wade.
This is nuts.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Something about my father?
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
You talked to Jack?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Call it what you want.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Well, it was an accident.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Find them everywhere. 
I don't know. You tell me.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
I don't drink coffee.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
Sir, you threw out page two.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Sir, we stay with the President.
I miss you. And I miss her.
I don't know why you stayed.
You give me ulcers.
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Forget it.  I was reading.
What's the story?
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Dunn.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine!
Simon just ejected!
Are you afraid?
Ted, the lever!
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Striker.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Both pilots!
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Captain, how soon can we land?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Rats! I've lost number three.
We have a visitor.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Excuse me, Sister?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Do you feel all right, sir?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
You okay?
In there.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
What is this?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
You know that guy?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
I'm going home.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
We?  You've taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...

Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
What kind of test?
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
HOW MUCH TIME?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
If I go.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
What's the question?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Well you're not reading it right!
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They'll get us.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
No, it's different, honey.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
What's that?
The marriage!
I've come to dinnnnnner!
That's stupid.
No, I'm not playing this game.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
I don't know.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Give me one reason I can understand.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Hey!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I said play!
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Yes, where?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What's that?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
What?
Leave that alone!
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
I'm afraid I am.
Really? Why?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
You mean she's not coming back?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Are you ill?
Yes.
The Fire.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
No, but I'm the best.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Ballet? What ballet?
Well, promise then.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
How old are you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
But...
Hello, Benjamin.
Feeling better?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Two weeks?
There were witnesses?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Are you cold?
Jack.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Right.
Beware the moon?
What do you think was wrong?
Say, David...
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
It sounds far away.
Where are we going?
Nice to see you.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Shut up, you zombie!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
It's you, David.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
You were saying?
Yes?
What's that?
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where you been?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
We want to talk to you.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Say, you can't do that—
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Excuse me—
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
You're lying!
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
No.
Yes.
What's keeping you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
They must have turned him down.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
—for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
So you were home last night?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Everybody in?
Where's Charlie?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
This is healing?
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
We got a problem here, brother?
This is the best score yet.
I'm sorry, Cole.
The Army can hang him.
Beg pardon?
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
What?
What you sayin' boy?
Beautiful.
A bad idea.
Still smells fishy.
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Boys...
You know you're welcome any time!
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Hell of a war.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
She's still talking to Jesus.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Easterners.
Riders --
You shouldn't be up.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Let me see that.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
You almost ended my career before it began.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Now let's have a drink.
... too young for whisky...
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
That.
So he's won.
On a lot of lithium?
I know. Stop it.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
J&B. Straight.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He has a great body
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're really serious, aren't you?
You're inhuman.
Because he dated her.
Are you sure?
What...is...it?
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I said we are totally booked.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Patrick Bateman's office.
So, what do you do?
A model? An actor?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Oh no, I'm okay.
Would you rather I not smoke?
Where did Paul hang out?
Don't you know this?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Yes.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What're you -- what?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Milo?
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
You're interfaced with our dish.
What?!
That's gotta kill him, right?
Milo? I'm Danny.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
It's okay. Really.
I heard what happened.
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Ready for number three?
What're we looking for?
You calling Phil and Randy?
You know mine.
...Were you?
What've you got there?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Who can we trust?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
How close are you?
Thank God.
Oh.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Is that how Larry feels?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
What is it?
Who're these guys?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Care for some saki?
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I don't get it.
I hate having my picture taken.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'll hurry back.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I love you, Austin.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
What is it now?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
What about his teeth?
I just don't see it.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
We don't judge here.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Red ...
You
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
The result would be ...
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
But why? What's the point?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
I wasn't about to.
Not quite. This is my field.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Was I?
You followed me.
Yes ... ?
And do you trust me?
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
No, after you.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Trubshaw again? What now?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Amnesia?
Why?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
What do you mean?
I've decided not to run for President.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Hello?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
What can I be doing for you?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Feel free.
Ed... you're kinky!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Hey.
Roll the hose.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
I want another shot, Sir.
Read.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Did I say thanks?
Yeah. Big fan.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
I have a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
He treats you okay?
You want some coffee?
You don't know him.
I'm working on it.
You don't know... nobody knows...
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
Oh, really?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
How's the case going?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
De-la-croix.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
I would like to change your name.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
This has to be a big mistake.
How was it?
Hello.
You okay?
What is your problem?
Who's side are you on?
So you have your small victory, now what?
Thanks.
How so?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Hi, Mona.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
How's the food?
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
You know how your Daddy is.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
I never had a really real pair before.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Money and nothing else?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...then what about...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Stop playing me Sloan.
Don't try to change to the subject.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Not even that.
How so?
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I feel the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
By name only.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
May I be quite frank with you?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Yes, he's fine.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
I beg your pardon?
What about Pike?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
I don't know... I like the Army.
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Where's the cabin?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Roberto, what the fuck?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Why did he come back for you?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Something funny, Levi?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Where are they!
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Stay where you are.
Is Dunbar cute?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Dunbar.
Buttfucks the cabin?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
This isn't the time --
No one else heard it?
Dunbar says you were.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Who, Levi --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
See! The big guy likes it.
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Will.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
How old are you?
Helping people makes me happy.
I'll...
Really.
Spooning the sherbet.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
You don't like it?
I thought you weren't dying.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
You need to go.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Is he awake?
So you never bought any land.
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you like it?
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
What was that?
How is bank?
I understand. I'm so sorry
Put the fucking kettle down.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
They go. John. They go.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Excuse me?
I don't want to talk about it.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You are throwing me out.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I don't know.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Goodbye.
Whatever.
It's not mine.
No. What? No. I know.
You have excellent English.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
How you feelin' today?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
Goin' dove huntin'?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
So...  That your first time?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I'm a what?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
I think she got to you, pappy.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Why?
What are you doing?
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Nick... You up?
This should be it...
You cool, Ich?
Short shift?
Are you expecting anyone?
What happened?
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
She disappeared... shit!
Nick --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
It's very small.
No...
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't be an ass.
Where's the wife?
I don't remember saying yes.
Might be different in New York.
Dope?
It's not your job.
Because I want you to tell me.
With these?
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I've done some questionable things.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
I want to do it.
Yeah.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
You equipped for random questions?
Not if it works.
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Next.
I think I have no money.
Vodka!
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Let's hear it.
Nerves of steel.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
What if you change your mind?
Are you for real?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I told you I'd come back.
What do people do in the afternoon?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
She didn't know?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
Methuselah Syndrome.
Hi!
This is my new friend...
Your mom was a dancer?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Well, that depends...
What's wrong with you?
So far?
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
What?
I guess we'll need another locker.
This is for me.
Yes.
Bites what?
When do you need her by?
You almost got us killed!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
I'm leaving, too.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Really?  Okay!
Hi, Eve!
...I do.
Is this because of the radiation?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Like one of Mom's?
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Right on the button.
That's right?
Who use to own it?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
The hotel.
How old are you?
What?  What is it?!
I don't see anything!
Whatcha looking at?
I do alright.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Good god.
You hear that?!
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Why?
Watch this!
Get the presents and do the lights.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
I don't know.
What's it to you?!
Where did he get all that information?
Gay.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Why do you do it?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Yes.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you like my body?
What?
Frank gone?
Look at these. What are these?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
Heineken.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
So, what's next?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay, thanks.
What's with Mike?
Yeah?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Okay, okay.
You were late.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Up where?
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
They got nothing.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nervous?
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
That was way easier than I thought.
He isn't to be touched.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
She was in here when it went down.
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Who the...
Chief, what the fuck is this?
How many bodies, Greenly?
Promise me boys.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Yes.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
OK. That's wrong.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Is it back in?
Holy shit.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
What about them?
They don't?
Obviously. That's a given.
Why don't you come with us.
I wish I'd been there.
I think we better go home.
Sixteen dollars.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Shit, Dignan.
OK. Mark that down.
Uh-huh?
Help me move him.
You're kidding.
He did?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
What's he in for?
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Let them fight.
Where you going?
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Bob, where you going?
Give him a second.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Jesus, Bob.
It's in the driveway.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
Yeah.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
OK, Bob.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's my responsibility.
Bob.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
The weed.
I know it's not.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I couldn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Hold on --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Why?
Where did he go?
What's the story?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
May I finish?
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Show me again...
That's not what happened to your parents.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
I emptied it.
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'll get the book.
No... How?
But you're sure?
So...
Where --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Say it.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Who?
Where am I?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Young Robert, we are honored --
Longshanks promised!
No, M'lord.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
The little cow is insane --
When will his trial be?
I'll wait... back there.
You know it's a trap.
I don't want to be a martyr.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I'm dreaming.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
You will die! It will be awful!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
What?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Just. Like. Jason.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
I know, but...
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Where are we going?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Lenny? Come on!
Here you go, buddy.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Er, goodbye, sir.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
And Mademoiselle?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Not an easy day to forget.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
My German's a little rusty.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
I didn't count the days.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
I don't understand. What about you?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Goodnight.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Yes.
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
Good morning.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
It was a combination of all three.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Manages what?
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Hello?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss!
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Can't.  Need water.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
Get water!
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
Jesus.
You can't make it.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Oh?  You've tried?
You?  Personally?
How was Russia?
I have to.
No.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
If I'd known you were alive --
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Need some help?
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Trying.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
You what?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
For the third time.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I mean your parents.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
What's she so emotional about?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
I've never seen a lobster.
What's the *medical* explanation?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Please don't make me say it again.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
How is that Wally doing?
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
I just wanted to ask you...
What's an immigrant?
Did you bite it?
What kind of plane are you flying?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
It's almost like flying.
I thought it was my turn.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
You're not yet three months, are you?
But you don't look very happy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Don't this place look like home?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
So, what do you do?
Silicon Valley?
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
We had to finalize the deal.
This has to happen fast.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Like what?
She had you tempting fate.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
It can buy you a new and better you.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
She up for this?
Minus one.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Says who?
You need to get a haircut.
He's gone.
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
And we got rid of the red head.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Ten percent.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Just a tip.
You guys awake?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
You trust this Moonan guy?
You're shaking.
I got scared.
The Indian rope-trick.
I couldn't resist them.
You really are a beautiful woman.
I had training. In the Republic.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
How did it go?
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Do you believe in astrology?
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
I didn't.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Jani! Where are you?
Where do you live, Jack?
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How many aces are left?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
You can start Monday week.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
What's he doin'?
It didn't go off.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Armed.
You are false data.
The only thing which exists is myself.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
In a second.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
-- automatic channels open --
TALBY!
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Doolittle! Help me.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
What's that, sir?
Oh, yeah?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
No wire.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Can I say something in my defense?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
I'll make it worth your while.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
No...
Soon, baby.
You're a thief?
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Know where I can find her?
I need to talk to her.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
That's odd...
Yeah.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Cool.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
It was stolen!
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
They're not idiots.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Yeah.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Simplicity, Hawk.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
I don't even think you have a gun!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
When can I squeeze one out?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
How can you do that?
What happened to your eye?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Hey...
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
That was a compliment.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Come with me.
Grandma Death.
You're my only son...
Cellar door.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
A sign from whom?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Regret.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
What is going to happen?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Kitty...
Chut up!
Where is she?!
You're what?!
You-betcha.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Amber...
Oh shit!
Mom!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
And wear a crown and everything.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
It must be done right away.
Once more! 
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
They have noble faces.
Did it go well, darling?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
You stay with me.
Like this. 
I want my man back.
I want him back!
Good! How is the patient?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Romance!
Have you read it?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
...Yyes
Merrick...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
You did this for me?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
A dressing bag?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Those things in your hands.
But you LOVED her all the same...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
You're as bad as my father.
No!
But --
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
What do you see, Erik?
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
I don't suppose... no...
Scream.
Louder.
Is THAT Odin?
Why should you care?
What are you talking about?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
Look, the sky is blue...
What did he say?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
A magic dishcloth.
How did he do that?
Vanish into thin air?
Same thing, isn't it?
Are you all right?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Let me go, Sven.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Shut up!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
He drove me mad!
Well... I'm game.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
No, it was lovely.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Oh, Tangerine.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'm sorry.
Rockville Center.
I'm sure you would.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Um --
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Tomorrow?
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I don't think we're ready.
Hi there.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Cool.
It's dark.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Doesn't sound like me.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
What? What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Oh, hey, Patrick.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
It's freezing out.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Order me a pastrami for after?
We can't do this.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Mary. What are you doing here?
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Oh, hi.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
What do you believe in then?
A traveler, eh?
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
What are you doing?
Are you in show business?
So now you're bummin' around?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Ballast.
Will it work?
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Coffee.
You weren't there. I saw it.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Is that an offer?
Can you shut it down?
What...?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
What is it?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Please...
Please... kill...
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Can anybody hear me...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
The "Other Place," what is that...?
What about my ship?
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
Heading three-three-four...
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Smith, get out of there...
That's an affirmative.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
Miller...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
He's engaged the override.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
What are you doing?
I mean...
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
What about his first born?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Sweet.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
You're happy for me and Victor.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
You are a virgin!
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone.
Jeff you have company!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
All right... where did you see her?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Who's that?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
How's it going.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Well I never did it.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What do you think it is?
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
But what are you going to do?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Aren't your parents asleep?
What's April 16th?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Killed?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
Where's the medicine?
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
I want that fucking radio!
NO! Stop talking like that.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Could I have that, please?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Stop!
Careful.
I think I know where a CB is.
And that's how I ended up here.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Come on!
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh, no.
Um-hmmm.
What's going on between you two?
Max?
Keys.
I'll go with ya.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
SHIT.
COME ON!
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Are you lying to me?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Well... come on.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Without me.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Harry!
Bye, baby.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Are you... are you hungry?
Oh, Kurt!
Age?
You sound as if you hate it.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
What?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Serious, huh?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Evening, gorgeous.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
Frances, it's me, Harry?
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
And no people.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
How long will you be?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Friends? Do they live around here?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Your crime... as well as mine.
Friend?
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
He always was opinionated.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I've no choice
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Brother and sister no more.
No. But someday.
I am not mad.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
I have always loved him.
What is your name?
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Your men are right to be afraid.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
Alice? The others show up?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Help you clean up?
What the hell?
What is it?
Chance to get even?
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
It's just a dream.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
It's beautiful...
How much do I owe you?
Have to drop you here, Steve.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
Yeah, follow us.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What about Kate?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Not a chance.
Who's this?
Died instantly?
You're a preacher?
Was? As in not anymore?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
He backed down.
To your family.
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
You too, preacher?
Did he...?
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Do what?
What did I say?
Yeah.
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm really sorry.
Watch my back!
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
How's it feel?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Keep your voice down.
You okay?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
I'm lookin' scared?
How?
How are you?
You could take their head off.
The woman I saw you with...
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Oh, really.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
No, sir, WHAT?
Then good night.
Aw, what is this...
Think I overplayed it?
"Coronado."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, ma'am.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
You'll think about my offer?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Come on, Montgomery...
Time.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
The Navy Cross...
Chances of recovery?
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
No shortage of suspects.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
O'Neil?
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Do you?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
Subject?
What?
I like that image.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
My God. He's going after the nest.
I'll take them all.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
...he's pregnant.
Circuits are overloaded.
My life sucks.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Wish me luck!
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
And how should we do that, Sir?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
You gave them the tape?
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
What'd they say?
I understand.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
"The show must go on."
And note the sucked in gut.
A boy comes to the door.
May I get the check?
Yes but, we were wondering-
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Okay, we got it.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
No, wait, are you-
That's It?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
Covalent... Right. So...
No, I'll kill you. .
As good as Hopkins?
How do you remember this stuff?
They're still behind us...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
We're alive!
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
That's it, It's go time.
I heard it too.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We pretend...
I... certainly, but-
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Could be this.
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Over three hundred miles.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Wil...
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
What are we going to do?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Sir, I think no such thing.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
A grand scheme?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
You must be very rich.
These supplies...?
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
To win this war I need an army.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
General Greene?
Well, this must be about something!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
Who?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Where is my nephew?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
The airport.
I don't know.
C-18.
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
What?
You say look at you?
Why would I do that?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You live in Miami?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You're an investor, is that it?
That's what I'm doing.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
You mean, Leo?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
For a movie?
She looks familiar.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Here's your keys, Harry.
We talk different?
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
How about this?
Very nice...
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
Rough day on the set?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
You been here the whole time?
Then you've read it?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
Yeah?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Why not?
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
Hm?
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
I don't have a dog.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Harry -–
You think the extra strain caused it?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
What's so great about Sweden?
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Smokes?
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Get up.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
The radio!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
That's a good thing?
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Go on.
What'd you find up there?
Who?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
He needs a doctor.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
What do you think happened on this boat?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Murphy to Epps.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Greer to Murphy.
I must be in the wrong business.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Murphy, goddamit.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I heard that.
I don't know.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What's this?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Someone from the past.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Who is this, Enid?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I...
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
No.
Do you want something to drink?
Nothing.
Why not?
Okay... I promise.
Hi Enid.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You call.
Ew, look at this...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
How repulsive!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
So, whaddya think?
Hi.
What about me? Am I not even here?
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
May I ask what you're doing?
A what?
Who does?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I'm totally serious!
So is that your boyfriend?
I don't think so...
Yes, that would certainly do...
What did you tell that girl?
Wow, this is so cool...
Aren't you going to get that?
Uh... hello?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
In what way do you mean?
What are you doing here?
What's up?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
I hate sports.
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
Let me see the sick.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Understand, I had help-
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Nonsense.
For you.
Do you love her?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
What are you working on, Egon?
Oh no.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
I'm not even good for me.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
Well, good night, Louis.
Should we go?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Egon!
What now, Brainiac?
Who, Ray?
This is what you do with your spare time?
What kind of tests?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My Fault!
What's your story, Pete?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Like a used car salesman.
On a purely scientific basis.
You must have gotten the last copy.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Yes?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Who?
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
What do you mean by "seen?"
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Tribuus... tomorrow.
What is that... wailing?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
The Senate too?
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
Servis made it through again?
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Serious stuff...
You need to come home!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Are you going to graduate school?
Aren't you eating?
Will you take me home now?
I want to go home.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Did they ever find out?
What?
I'm meeting someone.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
You're not one of those agitators?
I'd rather not.
Hello.
Can I help you, sir!
Will you take me home?
You don't?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Sit down, Benjamin.
No.
Aren't you?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Yes?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Do you understand what I said?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Yes?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Thank you.
You can admit that, can't you?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Oh my God.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
There isn't any.
Well how long has this been going on.
How many times a year.
But you don't hate him.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
What?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
And you were a student also.
What kind of car was it?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Really. I want to know.
No.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Drive down the block.
What have you done to her?
Nothing else.
Why did you say that?
You believe me, don't you?
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Thank you.
I know.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Benjamin -- where are you?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Need any help?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Like dancing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Too bad.
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
What?
We'll dance.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
That's a silly joke.
Do you understand?
Very early in the morning.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
Why?
Then you know him?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Any letters?
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
No - absinthe.
What's the matter?
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
What?
Skiing? 
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
You're a little too fast.
You're sweet.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
All right.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Yes --
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
How clear is Manchester?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Take them back, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
It is time for the performance.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Hi, Bobo.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
No.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Not much time.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't see why we have to take the train.
No.
What?
Working the what?
I've heard the name.
Upstate.
Atascadero.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
She didn't see you, in other words.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What is it? What's going on?
What's that?
Roy Dillon?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
That's natural.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Why am I here?
Well, when you put it that way.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Carter.
Carter.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
What?  Where is she?
You look kind of cold.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
The serial killer?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Fuckin' A.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You're so easy...
Thanks!
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
What if your parents come home?
Mommy, I'm scared.
Promise?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What should I do?
God ... this can't be true.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
There you are.  Who was that boy?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
You've created a monster.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Miss me, baby?
I suppose.
I didn't tell you everything.
You know what gets me?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Otherwise, how are things?
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Huh.
You told me.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Go to the funeral?
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Okay.  Okay.
I know you think that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Anybody home?
You were about to ask a question?
Ask it!
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
No.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
This is crazy.
Not at all.
Like hugging a lamp post.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Harold!
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Go on.
I came for my clothes.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He cried.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Honor, I suppose.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
No.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm going to call the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Good Lord.
It died for your sins.
This is man to man.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Cut me open.  Find out.
What are you going to do?
Who's dead?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Because he was cruel?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Don't touch me.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Oh, Paul--
That's an interesting piece of news.
Mom?
That's why I'm crying.
Yeah.
Everything stays as it is!
Don't worry about it.
It's fine!
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I'm touched.
Coming.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
What's the matter now?
You and Harold are friends?
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
What kind of a life is that?
That's been said before.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Get out of here.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
You've got to fight from time to time.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Yeah.
What do you mean?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
No.
How important do you think sex is?
What's T-J?
More or less.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Why do you say that?
She left you right?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Hello?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
The police? They know less than you do.
I'm only human, you know.
Where'd you hear that name?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Take it or leave it.
It's an investment.
I thought you were a businessman.
What does that do?
You can fuck off, too.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Was he with a girl?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Could I see your registration?
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Check.
Do you sing and dance?
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Sort of.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why do you say that?
What is it?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
What's that?
I think he's following us.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Maude, do you pray?
Just like this.
That wasn't very scary.
Oh, you weren't scared.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Yes. It does.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Your studies?
What would you say?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Yes.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Frank.
It's coming.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
No bad dreams.
And you're sure it was a woman?
I've got to finish it.
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
Who?
I need to touch it to "see"...
You are a Catholic??
Here. You'll need one of these.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
It's almost over!!
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Son. About Rasputin --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Got tired of me?
Well, you did break out --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
That voice --
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Helping you -- I just --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Anything else you --
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
It's freezing, isn't it?
But it's not true, is it?
Hello, I'm --
You fucking ass-holes.
Will you sign for the bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Lucky man.
No time for argument.
Nobody escapes us.
We want the man who did this --
Please. Get back into bed.
Frank --
What happened to you?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You would be. They tore me apart.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
What's the problem?
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Is it deep?
It's probably going to need stitches.
You're done worse.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Julia?
Larry...
Huh?
What's wrong?
No, not much.
No personal details?
You're awake. Good girl.
What a pretty tune.
What did you say?
Yeah.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I'm here.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Meaning what?
Steve. Thank God you came.
What's wrong?
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
What?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
Why would they care?
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Like fuck you are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna Moss.
May I help you?
Uh.  That's me.
Right.  Why?
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Is there a difference?
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Are you all right?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Can I do anything?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What were the others?
Did you say something?
It sounds stupid.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Are you still in love with me?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
Don't forget your CDs.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Nothing.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Rob here.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
So you live in Chicago now?
So you'll stay?
I'll call you.
Hi, Mom.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Byzantine?
Someone beat you.
He tried to kill me last night.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'd rather hear yours.
You did kill those men.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I hope I never get that old.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
He is older than I.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What were you doing in Felton?
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Stop.
You're not from these parts.
Does it change with me in the room?
You feel you know me.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
How can I stop such a man?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Who am I deceiving?
Complete your inspection?
We must talk.
How are you?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Run!
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
I want you to come to me.
Did you know the victim?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
What were _you_ looking for?
All I need is time.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
What doing?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
How's business, Bruce?
Anything the matter?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
Get out!
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
Call Duffy!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Sweeney.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Hildy!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
In a way.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
How about Bruce's?
You know me. The shirt off my back.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
So have we!
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
What went off?
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Pete, you're through!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Where's the money?
You know it is!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What do you want?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The City Sealer's office!
But how do I know...?
Get out of here!
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
There she is!
That was a googly!
Give him the you-know-what.
Only till they get you into the local school.
It's true.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Sod.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
I did see them. I did.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You know it? It must be an old one.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Is it peace in out time?
What did I do to deserve this?
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
He left!
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
That's not something to joke about.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
What?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Should we stop?
Come on, get with the facts.
And...
How's about you give me those same directions.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Fascinating.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Thank you.
Rise and shine.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
I still don't.
Jesus Christ.
What'd ya got there?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Oh, right.
I'm gonna go ask him.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Where's Bill?
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Please, just a minute.
Thank you.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Grampa... watch the language.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Plates match.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Hello, my little boy.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I am sleepy.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
Well, I think...
Please. I look a mess.
That's not how he tells it.
Hunh.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I want our boy back.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
My apologies, madam.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Yeah?
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
You do?
What are you doing in there?
What SPF, sweetie?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
It's perfect!
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Really?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
You were gone a long time.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Huh?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
I want to talk to you.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Could be.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Hey, mister.
Character.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
For me.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Man named Turk Baker?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Here, I got it.
When do I raise the bet?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I got time, Bert.
Half.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Who's he?
The expensive kind.
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
In the gut, I mean.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
With what?
HOW MUCH?!
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Findley.
What time?
There it is. I'm broke.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Long wait for a bus?
What time does the bus leave?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
What do you do on the other days?
Why?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You going out?
Who is it?
What happened?
No. You?
What is it, Eddie?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Now and then. You know how it is.
You name it.
How much do you remember?
Humans.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
I surrender --
So, what do you do?
You built things.
What's that, Dad?
Is the hill ours too?
It was so real, Dad.
I'm home now.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
George, where have you been?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What do you want?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Not really...
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
You try Martin?
Perfect, she's using it.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Dad, please...
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
How're we doing?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed!
So, what do you do for a living?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
My reputation precedes me.
May we go home now, please?
Your treat.
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Ah, Venice...
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Yes. Now we know.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
An old man's dream.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
I'm through!
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
It must be one of these...
No. You like the way I do things.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
How did you get here?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Those people are trying to kill us!
Dad?
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
What did you find, Junior?
Get that camel out of the way!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
This is your last chance.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Charming.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Let up on the brake!
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
That's far enough!
You will go to palace there.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
I like the service here.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
India...
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
A fulcrum release lever!
What?
What're we going to do?!
No, not her. Me.
My place, can't you see?
Are you threatening me?
You weren't listening!
Why? AL  You know too much.
Just walk down the hall?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Who is it?
I'll get in trouble.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Now what?
What is it?
Where is she staying?
What happened?
Where are you going?
Yeah. I did it.
They both look good to me.
Follow that busboy.
Even Rene?
It's embarrassing.
You shut down your sensors.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Some agent you are.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
One of your instincts?
I can't...
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Aim just in front of his face.
This may hurt.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Never mind that, where are we now.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
She is beautiful.
You're a lucky man.
JOE What abilities...?
Doesn't matter.
No!
Sir?
Yes?
Al Viola.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
We're here.
Don't you want to get out?
You'll feel better
Joe.
Why would we want to hurt you?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
What?
Then who did?
You mean from it.
You again.
Can I help?
Promise you what?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
If I was with you, I wouldn't
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
What did you tell them?
You work for Ryuji?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Where we going?
Chiang Cho?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
What is it?
Yeah...I have to get away.
Could I have it, please.
This the only spare?
It'l take months.
What's new?
I'll take some.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Mom.
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
When's the air date?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Is there any more rice...?
What?!
Lowell.
Lowell.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Who's that?
I know what I have to know.
...but that's as far as I go...
Should I just take the documents now?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
What did you get us?
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Where are you, anyway?
What about now?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Most certainly.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Why in God's name would I want...?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Who was that?
Marylin! What have I done?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
What is your husband's profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Is Tong older than Ming?
It sounded like a bell.
How nice.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
Oh, for the love of...
He's passionate.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Hmmm...
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Honey, I could sit...
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
You don't like me?
Miles? You're scaring me.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Pre-Castro.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
What?
But you're going through with it?
Well, that's about to change big time.
Mr. Massey --
That's delusional.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Mr. Rexroth.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
What do you think?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Who said anything about a reward!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
They're practically all the same, sir. 
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Whadda you want!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like what?
High time you got back.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Detectives!
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
This looks like the best spot.
What!
What's the matter?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What're you going to do?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
Any luck?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
No harm in your coming to see us.
Where's the bus to New York?
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
But can't you wait until morning—
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
I've been thinking about you.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
I said, the old man's screwy!
Mr. Gordon—
You're drunk.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Mebbe.
What's the idea?
What's up?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
What was his voice like?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Then who killed the President?
No.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Are we going away, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
...you heard echoes.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Who?
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
What's wrong, Lou?
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Time?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
How much more?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Why were you with him?
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
She knows it's my case?
Help us do what?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
What have they told you?
What did they want to know?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
This is pretty.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
How old's Annette?
I called you last night.
I see.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
What do you do when he comes home?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
How'd you find out?
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I thought you were tired of your business?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
He say we like the same thing as married.
Yes'm.
I know what it looks like.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She didn't say.
You said that the last time.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Sure.
What were you two fighting about?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Beaumont Livingston.
What do you think it is?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Can you cover that?
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Who?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Is it ready to go?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
He went to meet that stewardess.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Who was that?
How much is there?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
So what, you left her there.
Couldn't talk to her?
Where did you shoot her?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Where you shot her.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
They don't have your winning personality.
That's Winston. He works here.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
What's up with this shit.
My office.
Uh-huh.
Turn left.
My money's in that office, right?
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
What do you want?
You're hurting me!
You know, you got a strange line here.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
She hates me, Louis.
Ah!
What was that?
Jake, is that you?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Where are you?
What do you think?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Yeah, but for what?
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
We're at Della's.
Why? What for?
Can't you stop it?
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't gimme that.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
Who else were you expecting?
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Oh God!
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Where's Wong?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Push 'em back.
Hello.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
What are you doing?!!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Where have you been?!!
Everyone okay?
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Hurry!
Get them in the lab!
Yllo, what's your head count?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Pull me in!
Rizzo, he's out there.
That's why I'm here.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Kaboom.
You're so bossy.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Robot huh?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Do I have to?
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
How do you open the damn door?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Yes!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
I never saw one that big.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
How come you have to tell them that?
Colorful, isn't he?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
What? What?!
Where'd you get all this?
You all right?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
What day is this?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
We're not even sure what it was.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
You wanna call it a night after here?
Leg of lamb this time?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
You love sharks?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Yep.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know it's okay.
Mine too.
Did you hear it's yours?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Nails? Really?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
We don't even have a dog!
Wow, dream big!
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Yeah.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
The Wizard of Gore?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
What?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
What?!
Or...
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Have you found a place to stay?
What?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Happy birthday Adele.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Shush, Adele.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This the book your writing?
Now why is that?
Sure.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
...and?
You two been busy in here.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
I like that.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
All set?
What's that?
There's more...
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Carrie, watch for Early.
Bri'.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Did she suck your dick?
Why?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You got any money?
I hate this game.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Nah.
Casper, where is he?
Where you at?
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Sup then? Sup?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Yeah.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Are you in trouble with the law?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
You didn't?
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Oh shit.
Yep.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Hi mom.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
What's that supposed to mean?
Morpheus.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Sorry.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
A few people.
Hello, Peter.
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
Hello?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
What?
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
Yes?
It's me you want.  Not her.
Nope.  Nothing.
Now what?
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
What scars?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Congratulations, dad.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
Did you see his face?
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
We got a problem?
About what?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Is this your first time here?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
What are you looking for?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
I'm not playing a game now.
I just don't want to fight with you.
You.
I tried again and got through.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
You're right.  The killer told me.
You beat him.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Where is the Fortress?
The White Castle has fallen.
They know when they're going to die?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
I cannot reach her.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She must make a glaive.
I can. Because I choose it.
I road them often in my youth.
Even by you?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
Sugarballs?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
A fine match.
The new King.
You know the voice.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Each to his fate, lad.
She was not as beautiful.
Do not try your trickery on me!
It will not help.
I cannot stop the sand.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Rocket launcher.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...I'm going to kiss you.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
You can't sit here like that.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
It's impossible.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Yes -- you are.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Anything?
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
Your father?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Most certainly.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
What do you want?
Water?
Hello!
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
If I was I'm sorry.
Don't run away.
You OK?
Yes.
Ben?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I wanted to see you...
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I loved him!
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
I think so...
You can't even imagine.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
Good one.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
The idiot speaks.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You almost had me fooled.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
You have Stromwell.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Hey --
What're you doing here?!
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
And I fully support that.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Now I am.
I didn't mean --
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
No more... please...
Yes?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
You be our guest, Jack.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
But... but, why?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Fine-looking army.
We must follow that bird.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Nice piece of work.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Why not mine the damned walls?
Easily spoken...
Water doesn't burn...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Jack!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
My lady mocks me.
I have no wife.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sunlight?
How do I get the horn back?
I don't believe you.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
That was in jest.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Praise be to God.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Where?
Hello, Jack.
Sorry, Jack.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Dad's disappeared!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
When does George get to come see his house?
Do you guys feel like painting?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going to bed.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
I'm living here while I build another house.
Can you keep Sam straight?
He's a freak.
Huh?
Josh said...
I was wondering.
You hate your father.
Where are you?!
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
Pardon me?
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
I didn't recognize you!
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Where are you going?
Did you got through my pants?
I'll have to pay him back.
What are you now?
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
What are you doing?
A blueprint spool.
I was parked in day parking.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
You brought your kids?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I'm helping George build his house.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Despite you.
No.
You don't look like you.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
No, nigger.
I'm talking about a haircut.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah.
Why not?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Don't mention it.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Let it go, Claude.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
All in, boss!
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Wait for the firemen!
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Makin' friends already.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Come on. One more time.
Good idea... kill me.
You think I'm a tourist?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Hey.
I think I'm floating.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
..."The Devil?"...
Can we go fly over Central Park?
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
I'm a Sandman!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Answer the question!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Don't!
What does it mean?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
Is it inside the city?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
How long have you been living here?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Are you ready to put him in?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Well? How do you like it?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
We'll keep a watch on the house.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
What's that, Ed?
I was here yesterday.
Hello.
Hello.
What's he do?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Please tell me.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
You talk to him?
Repeat that, Bill.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
I won't ever tailgate.
What's that?
Does it say anything on the tape?
From the club. You didn't answer.
I had a dream about you last night...
What the hell is going on?!
Let's go home.
At sixty?
Hello.
Who is this?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
What are you guys doin'?
Last time I saw you.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Why don't you like me?
I didn't know you cared.
All of it?
Fossils, huh?
A what?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Certainly not.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Yeah. You know.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Huh?
You mean you don't want to go?
And mine's Conway.
Goodness, no!
Oh, yes.
Very often.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
You're lying, aren't you?
Are you taking me?
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
What are these people?
Oh George, come on.
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
Yes.
Well - I mean—
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
You can't take her away from here!
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
Good.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Thank you.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Ouch!
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
No. just peace on Earth.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
They don't?
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
I wasn't scared...
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
The radio show?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Since how long?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
So... how'd you hear about this?
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Yeah ... ?
Goodwill...
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
And they're buying it?
Yeah?  What's up?
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
How'd you know?
Wally!
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Kill type?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Tell me not to worry, John.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Lara called me.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
You can't run --
Uh, sir...
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Red Ball?
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
To them.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
She's a precog?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Sean --
Do you know who I am?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
You don't seem all that proud.
Why?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Why should I trust you?
You said they're destroyed.
Good God.  What was that?
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
So there is a way to fool the system?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
He looks familiar.
Raincheck?
I don't have any sugar either.
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
Yeah.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
I can take you down there.
As far as...?
I know.
What the fuck was that about?
Ricky's not wearing one.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Hello.
So, what kind of gig is this?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
I feel weird asking him.
No coke tonight.  Right?
I want you to quit.
I never promised you anything.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Yeah.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
He must have that shit troughed.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yeah. Sure.
There won't be a next thing.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Spa?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Yeah?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
What about it?
So, it was a draw.
So, it's not a winning record.
How am I being shitty?
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I gotta pick up the baby.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
How much is it?
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
What are you doing?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
What exactly did they say?
They didn't say an address?
Motherfucker...
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know this guy?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Wanna bet?
No.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Kinda. Yeah.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
You look good, man.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes.
You strapped?
See you later.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Yeah.
Yes. You're going to New York.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
Who's gonna outfit us?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Is your papa West Indian?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I'm wearing, Archie.
What did you give it to me for then?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Little.
I will do it.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I'll be away a lot.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
We need you too!
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Can I ask you something?
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Let's go.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Get out.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
You evil this morning.
Well, all right, then.
That's a fine chick.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Yes sir.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Senor?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
[Drive.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[What do you mean?]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
And what if amateurs try it?
How long you staying, Crease?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Do you think he'll come back?
It hurts.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
You feel sorry for the husband?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You've done much of this work before?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
Good news. You're going back to school.
He has to go, Samuel.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
I don't think I remember him.
Ah?
When was this?
It pains that they should do this.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Wadda you think?
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
No, Marty, please...
No...
No...
You got an elevator in this house?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Ma.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Sure.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Okay.
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Which hospital?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
Wait a second...
Give us this day our daily...
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Gimme three.
You betcher ass, Dad.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
All of them?
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
They missed the boat.
Why can't you look at him?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
What's going on? Who started this?
O'Reilly!
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Huh?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Better let me talk to him.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
The letter.
You made it up.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
What John Doe?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
What do you do when you work?
Baseball?
Yeah, Boss?
Help yourself.
Who's got him?
St-rike!
A what?
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Four bits.
Join the John Doe Club.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
How about family? Got any family?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Oh!
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Racket? What do you mean?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Is there a crowd in the street?
Hello, guys.
Dinner's on you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
Tell me what's wrong.
What do you got on Korda?
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
You can't kill me like this.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
How do you feel after a shooting.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
How are we gonna get him out of there?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
You tell me.
Yes.
What did you see?
I'm just practicing my lying.
Is it always like this?
You're crazy.
McCall, you all right?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
You crazy? With all those people around?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Any verification on numbers.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
But this is impossible.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Divinity?
You are not a God.
What?
The woman you're stuck on.
One condition.
What is it?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
You went to my high-school?
Then how do you know about --
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
But I don't know anything about programming.
Don't know what you're talking about.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
I'm in!
It's... an eagle?
And how do we release the power?
Just shut your gap!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That was a CHEAP shot!
We're asking you to go to prison.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
Luciano.
I booked passage to London.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
You're getting' 10 cc's
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
This business is about taking risks.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
He's an animal!
You get fifteen percent.
We learn from life.
The terms will be mine.
Forget it. That's past.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Where's the stiff?
Forget it.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Who did this?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
At the moment, yes.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
He seemed quite taken with you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Really?
He's an organic farmer.
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Oh--yeah--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
No.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
That infernal phone!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
I did. What about it?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yes, I was--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Y-yes.
Yield *how*, sir?
It does!
Mr. President--
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
A *day*!
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
What?
Pardon?
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
I did--and--and I got right up.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Ax?
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
You won't stand for it?
Anything *better* to offer?
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Do I actually *see* this--?
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Are you married?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Tell me more about yourself.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Now, what do you see?
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Hello, Mary?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
People have been crucified before.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
You're a fool, Babe.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
How'd you get the picture?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Fourteen carat?
Thank heaven.
Come on, John. What happened?
Newspaperman?
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
I can't find him.
Look!
Yes?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
I'm Chairman?
We provide opera.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Your Honor—
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
What is your name?
Farmer?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
What are you doing for lunch?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
I see.
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
What's that?
What is it?
What brought this on?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
How long you been in this town?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
...so rich?
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Got a license?  But no car?
Can you help Mom?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
I've offended you!
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Is it something you've heard about me?
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
We're only talking about six weeks.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
Would you like another beer?
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Did you carry a gun?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Psych major?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Goin' somewhere?
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
And what did he say?
Yeah, I was there.
Every damn day.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
We're almost there.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I'm not?
According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
I think you were jealous
Got guts, lady.
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
That looked rather painful.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
He was the last time I saw him.
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Yes!
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
That boy's got talent.
I'd better go.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
It's me.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
You're the Sphinx.
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
Nah.
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Or flowers.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
But... only when no one is looking.
You guys going to a costume party?
Are you famous?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This is bad.
And there's the Sphinx.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Ah -- you approve?
Please...
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Bastia -- and you?
I haven't been there for three years.
No, they're living in Nice now.
Why didn't you wake me then?
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Do you know what you're saying?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Fuck, what's his name?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
You straight?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
What's the matter?
Blow.
What you see?
Hello, remember me?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
You wanna knock?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Tape his mouth shut.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Hey, what's going on?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Don't remind me.
I need your help.
Who did?
What?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
This? I've never even fired one.
Come back.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
I said I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Please...
You're going to go see her.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
You stole that.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Close your eyes.
You got this under control?
Get moving.
That one.
And what happens if I don't call you?
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
I'll light the lamp.
AAA-MENN!
Yes! Yes!
And the Lord told that man --
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Who?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
You go set down by the River.
Amen! Amen!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
You, Pearl. You swear too.
John...
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
What are you doing, boy?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
How's that?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
This man down at the Drugstore...
Miz Cooper!
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
It's just a stupid cat.
What the hell's going on!?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Bring him out of what?
Dad -- what you doing here?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Where you think you're going?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Give me the key, mother.
What the hell you doing here?
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Well, a hat...
An evening gown.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
He's cutting our throat...
Misha! Misha!
That must be the one!
What a lovely room you have here.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I am, Gaston.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Good evening, Your Highness.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Leon, my little boy.
Let's do that.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Bad news?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
What's new?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
That's two weeks from Thursday...
What can I do about it?
Business.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
In other words you don't know.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes, it is.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Let's forget that we ever met.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
I have never heard one.
I don't look too foolish?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
But, darling, you can't do that.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
...and we won't clench our fist...
It's dead.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
You haven't seen her yet?
That bad?  Old or young?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Where are they?
You leave me no choice.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Good morning, Comrade.
Cigarette?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Where to, madame?
At Père Mathieu's.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
How's the job coming, Bob?
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Why not?
We can't touch Hoover --
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who?
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
I did?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Mr. President!
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Mom expects great things from you ...
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Mr. Castro.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
... little Bobby.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
Who do you think is behind it?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Why, you got a customer?
Who we working for?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
How about Kissinger along with him?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Where you from?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
We got the press this time!
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
Amen to that.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Were you planning to tell me?
This.  Above all.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
He looked old, didn't he?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Because ... I have to relax.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Congratulations, Dick.
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
It'll be over soon.
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
How'd you know I was here.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
He's real all right.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am, I do.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
...You ride Winston.
What about yours?
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
I thought it was a car afire.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
What do you think.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Not like that. Not like you say.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Big talk.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Llewelyn --
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Promise?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
Yessir?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
What airport would you use.
Airport.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
With anything?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes I do.
Call it.
How's that?
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Yessir.
Okay.
Well enough.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
Could I get another room.
What about one forty-two.
Not that way.
I don't mean braze.
Pot metal?
Why would he go to Odessa?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Are you jackin' with me?
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
...I meant your food.
It wasn't a woman.
Any idea where it is?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
No... what about your sister?
What?
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
That's very kind of you.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I don't think your friend likes me.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Dr. David Ravell.
She called you 'George,' George.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
You don't sound like you're from here.
It's something I had to do. For David.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
The Five?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
What are those for?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Rosa...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
No... before that.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
You can't do this -
It ain't the law!
That's right!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
How'd he know about the treasure?
Izzat right?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Suckin' away.
Ass right.
Pullin' ah pants down...
I counted to three, honey.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
The preacher said it absolved us.
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
That's a maiden name.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Mayo, are those your friends?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
What did you call me, Mayo?
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Vietnam?
You're sure it's okay?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
How late?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
God help you, Lynette!
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
And you turned him down??
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I vote for the motel.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Hi.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Hey, you guys still awake?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
What?
What the fuck is funny about this?
There is not one thing funny here.
He said open it.
The hell does she want?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's gonna handle it.
-- posed to mean?
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
She said she did.
I mean it!
'Bout four o'clock.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
478...
What do we do?
I heard you.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Why?
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
You got to sit on Eldridge...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Inspector Brimmer
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
You got it. Berkeley?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
You want me to put a man on it?
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yes sir, I did.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Fuck is up?!
Motherfuckers...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You believe that?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Well?
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
I know him well enough?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Sir?
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Father...
Did your father teach you humility?
Is it?
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
No, I don't.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
How far away?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Gray.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Ellie? What's wrong?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Yeah, sure.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
What?
I can hardly read these.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
What do you mean?
I'm not climbing that.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I think it's rather extraordinary.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Do you believe him?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
I'll drop it!
You've got sand, for a maid.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
That would hardly be proper.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Difficult ... to say.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
What?
If I had known --
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
You?!
Come on!
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
To freedom.
Why?
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Just do it quickly.
What's that?
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
No, it's not.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
How long do you leave him in there?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
She says it's not.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Icarus?
It will be an ascension.
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Where did he go?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
I don't believe this is happening...
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Look at this!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
How far can you stretch?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Argon's private lab.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
That's impossible.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
Your place?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
You have the cutest nose I've—
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
You're my what?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
All right, outside!
That's a canary, sir.
My error.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
To Old Madrid.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
Who was that?
No.
A statement? Good.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Did you call, sir?
Yes sir.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
It's okay. It's alright.
Sure is pretty.
... Why?
What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
I think I've got something to say.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Oh God.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Can we do any better?
JENNIFER!
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Are you sure?
So what's it like?
Real rain?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
Yeah ...
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Excuse me?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Bud?
What's wrong?
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Hey.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Yes, I'll be there.
...yes I'm still on hold...
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Hello.
Please don't.
You just said very food.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You're so scared.
....no....
No.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Hi....what....what's up....?
I'm going to work.
It was cool last night.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
This is funny.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Hi.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Are you ok?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
No.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
It's alright.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
What is this?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
....now: this pudding?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Yes.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes. Sorry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Yes I am.
Nothing.
I know.
So they'll go.
Hello?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
I must grant him his last rites.
And --?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
You're a sentimental man.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Leave at once --
That poor woman.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Thank you for your time
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
Hearst?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
What are movies about?
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Sigmund Freud?
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
May I help you?
To do what?
You're lying to me.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
For Christ's sake, shut up--
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Oh, no--
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Sure. What is it?
Yeah --
Do you see her yet?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
You want us to wait for you?
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
But you said "you."
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
Nine o'clock.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Huh?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Jake, no --
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
The kids are sleeping.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Name me a better photographer.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
If possible -- both.
A detective's nightmare.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Where?
Like what?
Hello.
Something wrong?
I knew it!
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
He and his wife splitting up?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
What about this morning? Any developments?
A Federal offense.
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
What about the rest?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Maybe she died.
What are you getting at?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Steady Marlon!
Friend of yours?
Meaning me?
What you say your name was?
Any other entrance?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
You awake?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Are you going down there?
Frank!
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
He has a knife.
They're looking for you!--
Hey where'd you go?
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
I came here before.
Plato?
Plato!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Wash up and go home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
Okay--
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Where's Dawson High School?
They'll be looking for you.
You still pretty upset?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Oh, Jim!
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
You smell like baby powder.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
No!
What's he like?
Hi, Plato!
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel, you promised!
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Searching for a money man...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
Negative five?
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
No, Nick, no --
Gabriel!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
He says he wants it now.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
I had better sex in prison.
Be more specific.
Hey, it's... been two years --
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
Ash?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
I can't go back to Vegas...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Cancer-sucker.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Rudy, don't move --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Tell Ashley... I...
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Mr. Brown?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Who's your parole officer?
Mr. Blue's dead?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
What the fuck are you talking about?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
Dead.
I'm cool.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
I got the diamonds.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Tell them to come on in.
And this is Helen Carter.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Like what?
We can't stay here!
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Thanks for taking over.
That's right.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Can I have my gun back?
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
How's that?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
That something I shouldn't see?
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
And you're all alone.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
You're not giving up?
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Because there's a man I want to see.
We got company. Female company.
Gee, I can't.
And that's tough, isn't it?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
How about California?
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Thanks.
Ouch!!
Oh my God! We're dead!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Hi Buddy.
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Oh, right.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Where's Shorty?
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Huh?
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Did you do that?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I got it!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I finished all the interviews.
What are you working on?
She's right. We should stick together.
It's okay. I understand.
Father, are you okay?
Yo son, check this out.
What does it say?
"Ray!"
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Bring her home... I guess.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
"P" as in...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Man, that one made me puke!
Are we leaving?
What is it, Betty?
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
We can't stand here all night.
What did she want?
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Who the devil is he?
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
You'll be all right?
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
I didn't know.
Yes.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
But he also wrote --
Have you ever been on television?
Graham is an unusual name.
You play an instrument?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years?
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Do you want them?
You are?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
What... what are these interviews about?
You just ask them questions?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
You know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
Yes.
Have you fantasized about me?
Her name was Elizabeth.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
I've told you.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Loud.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
You son of a bitch!!
What visitor?
That you are under no obligation to me?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
And what?
Yes, I did.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Why?
I get real busy between two and four.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
About what?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Prettier than Ann?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Hello.
John Millaney.
Hello.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Why not?
Hung up.
No.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plenty of room for two people.
Everybody has a past.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Hi, John.
God, you need help.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
IBM.
Hi.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Where is he now? Do you know?
But where are you going?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
You got it!
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
I'm not going, Janet.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
. . .For his own good.
That's an extremely negative response.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
This could be worse than the old series.
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
So what's up?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
You okay, Miles?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
What do you smell?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
It does. Feels right.
Sure I know Maya.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
What?
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
What?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Please, Miles, please.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
What the fuck!
Well. That about does it.
Love you, man.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Is she sleeping or...?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
I had class.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Hello?
Hello?
Ken.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
Daddy.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Does it hurt?
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...Tell Graham --
I see.
No I'm not.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Morgan, be careful.
How can you say that?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're distracting us?
How do they know it's over?
We might lose the signal.
I'm getting out now.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
They'll read our minds!
I can't even imagine.
Did someone save me?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
Goodbye?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Doesn't look quite fair.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
That's a lie.
Never will again.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
This a friend of yours?
Who is he?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
You can't do this.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
What about his brother?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
You work here?
Is this a fair mix?
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
I can't wait to meet her.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
My two favorite girls.
... Simone.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Hello?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
What I do to Simone?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
For her?
You can't.
There's... a wall between you --
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Hi, Dad.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Nice boat, Taransky.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
Would you like me to read?
You could play the lead.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
What if it catches on fire?
A star is...
You did create me.
Don't step in the horse manure.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
What were they hiding from?
You're a doctor. What kind?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
You want to ask me a question?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
Dr. Crowe?
You really look better.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You know that accident up there?
Where is she?
They?
She wanted me to tell you--
I don't know how else to look--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Bitch.
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
It's time to make amends.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Down boy.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Mac... let's get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
What is it?!!
Sorry.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
It's my nature.
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Flip.
I never danced in a towel before.
I loved you. I loved --
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Well?...
Yeah.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
Why are you stopping?
One to five?
What are you thinking?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Do I have a choice?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
He's giving them up?
How bad?
Did he give you his name?
And this is your car, isn't it?
Man, that's great.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I'm here, where's the car?
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
It's the last place they'd look.
You're finished.
...When did you know all this?
You got clicks, anything?
... Jesus... what for?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
I'm working on it.
Why?
What'd you say?
I DON'T KNOW!
What else did Padiche say?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Jesus...
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
You're better when you take them.
Is it intelligent?
Then it's God, right?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
Can you sleep?
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
You want it coming back with us?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Yeah.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
What do you want to do?
Are you okay?
Claire...
What a memory.
Do you?
... Mike.
Claire!
I like your coat.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Okay?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Mike, take it easy...
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Even Joey Venza?!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Yes.
Are you in charge here?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You're here 'til what time?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
How do I know that's her?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Let my kid go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Shooting.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Yeah--
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
I suppose.
I... I like you.  A lot.
Waldos.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
It's Friday night...
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Your dog ate it.
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
So they're airing this tonight?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl!
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Come again?
I'll live.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
You are being rude again.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
You can say that again!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
You want Betty Grable!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
I'll open mine now.
You're crying, Animal.
May I have this dance, Miss?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
Lay off, Sefton.
You heard that, Sefton?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
Who did?
What are we going to do with him?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
This is me in Cincinnati.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Where is he now?
Target their Bridge.
Data?
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Can you locate them?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
Antonia?
Close to retirement?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Oh
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
But I do have a theory...
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The Nexus.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
I don't believe it...
Why don't we beam it up?
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
I don't understand.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
What's wrong?
I know you... Do I not?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Close... There --
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Wait! Give me a chance --
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
He asked you not to grieve...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What I have done, I had to do.
So!  Speak!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
How can you tell that?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Physician, heal thyself.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
He's on a build up to detonation!
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Yours... is... the superior...
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Yes, Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
What IS working around here?
... the good of the few...
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I speak, sir?
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
I really must thank you.
Stop engines.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
I do this because I was there,
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Now wait just a damn minute.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
You're joking...!
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Memory problems, too.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
It's true... what you said...
... Gone?!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You tricked me.
Permission to come aboard.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Admiral. Full power is restored.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
What is our condition?
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
10 seconds, sir!
What is it?
Estimate range, ship to whales!
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
I'll have to re-energize.
The whales...?!
The explosive override -- ?
Hi.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
You have warp capability?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Why not...?
Anij!
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Yes... that looks like them.
A ship,
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
That's your expert opinion?
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
My name is Sojef, Captain.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
One. It's Ru'afo.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
You haven't done that in a long time...
Come in.  Hi.
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Augh.
All hands. Battle stations!
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Do you know what this is, Data?
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Who are you?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
This must be it.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Captain --
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
Main bus...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Were the two of you... involved?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Captain?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Emergency override!
They're bypassing Engineering...
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
What the Hell's going on?
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
No!
Thanks...
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
I was nervous -
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
Torpedo room--?
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
What took you so long?
And your coat.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Sorry -
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Never been this close.
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
What is it?
Captain...
The peace conference.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
I SHOULD have been -
Close enough to beam down?
Direct hit -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Can you remember our father?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
What do you imagine this is?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
It's you.
Counselor.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
How can you be certain?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Cannon fodder.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
New Praetor?
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Why don't they answer our hails?
Not very chatty.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Report!
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
And?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
What can I do for you folks?
What do you think of America?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where's that?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
George... Do you hear me, George?
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Please.
Please...
What?
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Who?
Shit.
What?
I...
What's the matter?
Why are you going here? What is here?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Are you angry at me?
They are beautiful.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
This is yours...
Help me!!
Help me!!!
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
I told you...
Is there a reward in this?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Maybe.
No.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Charm.
It's alright.  He means it.
Nero.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
And what about the guy that was following me?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
I've got a good idea, yeah.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Take it to him.
Are we under arrest?
Right.  That explains it.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Besides that.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
He was sitting here?
You have the photo from the diner?
We have another one.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I'm hesitant to...
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
Why did you go to Chicago?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Don't you touch him.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Doesn't fit.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
What was your weakness, sir?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Let's talk about Zero.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
You have to put things in perspective.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Yeah.
Well, thank you...?
Hi.
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
I thought I was going to die.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Hi.
Always...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
What do you guys do?
You have to lay it on the table.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Well... This is it.
I'll be around.
...well, it suits you...
Lorraine?
How's it going? It's been a while...
How are you doing?
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
So I don't call either way.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
There's the rub.
It's definitely a step back for me.
You want to hit the town tonight?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Oh, like that song...
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
What's dumb about it?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
They turned you down?
It's kinda money, actually.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
You gotta do it.
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Nice, baby.
Christy was nice...
I don't think so.
He drives a carriage.
How you guys doing?
How long do I wait to call?
It's not like that...
Is she looking at me, baby?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
It's on.
Sorry man.
The bear's got his claws back.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
And you?
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
You heard about your father?
You take care of Paulie?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
I'll think about it.
You think we'll go for that last place?
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
No, I wanted other things for you.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
I know about what you mean!
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
I LOVE YOU.
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Uncanny!
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
Shut up.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Who's this?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Good afternoon!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Freddie?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Ha.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Hello?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Hardly.
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
That ring's so great. The green one.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Oh my God. Tom.
Is he really not here?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I found Dickie's rings.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
No!
It is a little coarse, yes.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Well, we're all working tonight.
What kind of people?
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
Travis?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
How long has he been there?
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Yeah.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
20 bucks?
Well... I guess so.
What's your real name?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
But that one night?
Well, I tried.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
What do you mean?
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Anything you say, officer.
Wha -- ?
So howsit?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Had a close one.
Spit it out.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
I don't understand....
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Motor oil?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
You first.
What was that?
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Sir, that is true.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes... yes, I do.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Here we are.
Mother o'god...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Why?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
Ernie.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Jesus...
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Jesus.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Exactly.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
They all know you?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Who?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
San Francisco.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I did.
Do you think I should go?
Yes.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Good morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
See them two big trees across there?
And the white house?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
We won't be here.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
He was killed last night. By birds.
Well, where did he go?
Sixty...  Oh.
Lovebirds, sir?
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Doesn't what make me...?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
I think you're a louse.
So you're a lawyer.
Ouch!
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
What did it say?
With... with Annie, of course.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
What?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Are you all right?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Some cream?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
The town looks clear.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
There we are!
Have you got a pencil?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
You must leave this house.
But Richardson?
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Toddy hates me.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
This is a gift.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Any attacks of pain since?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Think maybe knives do?
Fuck! What do you want?
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
Yeah, no kidding.
No. You don't.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... it connects you to me...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
An accident, Nathan.
What's with your friend there?
I think I dropped an earring.
You wrote this?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Such power exists?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Gee, I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
I thought that was only for bombs.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Go to the movies.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
I want to know what he told you last night.
It must be twelve-thirty.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Well, how do I know who you are?
That's right.
Don't!  Stop!
Where is she?!
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
... And stay outta here.
You like Michael.
Still mad at me?
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
Sure.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Tell them to get something to eat.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Oh, no.  Now what?
-- a job.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Does it burn?
But you passed the test!
What's your name?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
Huh?
You're beautiful.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Sixteen.
Where these tracks headed?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
What you doin'?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
What's happening?
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Spaceship of some kind.
Neither will we.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Anything?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Put that down!
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
What about Childs?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
We should sleep in shifts.
Now how did you get hurt?
What do you do on the towers?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
You know of them?
We need your help.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
All right, what is it now?
Alex, what is it?
Alex, what is it?
In the future, we'll be better.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Did you hear me, lad?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Oh, that explains everything.
Why?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Is he all right?
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I don't understand.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
He said he traveled for two months.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Where do they take them?!
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Do you really believe me?
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
What?
I've been ok.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Well, how'd you get here?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
Well, good for you.
This is a great song.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Honey?
We're both fine.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Armed robber.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
That sounds nice.
What did ya do?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Do you love me?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
And what's the mysterious code word?
Hey, peaches.
Hello...
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Is this your car?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
In case of what?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
But you think he fools around.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
What happened to your hair?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Louise?  Where are we?
I am really sorry about this.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is it?!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Then let's not get caught.
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
What's so funny?
No You mean...?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
We're in love with your roommate.
Healy you dog!
Very nice.
Here, just have one of these then.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
How'd you know that?
Are you... an architect?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
How about -- ?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Turn it up, Magda.
All set.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
She's blackmailing you, right?
You want her dead, don't you?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Miami?
Hey, hey, hey!
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Friend. Baseball bat.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Thanks for picking me up.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Oh. Well I am.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I see where you're going.
I'd go with the seven.
What's a mook?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Ted, are you okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Well... why don't you move back?
So you're a writer?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Ted...?
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Slow down. Smell that?
Yeah?
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Six rounds. 357.
Meet me at base. Over.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What was he saying?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
It's not real.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
This Jimmy's?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
It isn't?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Where did you see that?
It never came up.
You don't have to kill it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
You're totally insane.
That's not what I hear.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
Off me or off you?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Yes, Sergeant?
Let's hope you're right!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Ohhh Mother!
No! Not again!
Gotta go, man.
Is it the plane?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
The list is long, but distinguished.
You ever done this before?
What the hell is this?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
That's Kazanski.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
Figured it out yet?
I've seen this before.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
It was bad.
He's a good pilot.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You think I shouldn't fly.
What's wrong with this one?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
I'll go encode your room key.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Kill him.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Amazing.  Where are we?
You open it.
What is it?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
HER!
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
On his way.
I don't know.
No shit...
Lori...
Well...What do you say?
What are you doing?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
No options.
Go on.
...What?
I thought you didn't like me.
Now what?
Where are you going?!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
This is one big mother!
Prairie dog burrow...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Use the fucking bomb!
Road's in!
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
How's she doing?
Down, honey, down.
And I appreciate it.
Twenty.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Darn it!
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- an angel dust dealer --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
-- Easy as that, huh?
That DD-5.
Do you have to do that?
-- What?
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
...Jesus!
A fucking wheelchair?
-- Find him?
Figures.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
'lo, Cecil.
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Look. Mister --
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
What color hair will she have?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
We can do it right here.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
OK, Gordon.
What is it, Gordon?
HE'S GONE.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
The usual, 9:15.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Call me.
Do you want to talk?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
But I love you, Laura.
Right on time, baby.
We're on our way, Baby.
James...
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
This afternoon?
What about tonight?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Bobby killed a guy.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Can I take the car?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
What's wrong?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
...he wants to testify...?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Ed Concannon.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Anything special about the case?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
Thank you...
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Is it over?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
It's a long road that has no turning.
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
That's right.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
What happened in those three...
You look kinda lost yourself.
Did you see it come down?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
What was it like?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
That needle ain't pointing north!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
They'll understand us, all right!
Can I read it?
So I don't know about horror.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Yes.
Doctor...
I want my kid out of here now!
What?
When do you think it'll be done?
Freddy, for all I know.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
The car's no there yet?
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Captured?  How?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That was Nancy, not me!
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
There's still a way.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
Feels different doesn't it?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Sorry to here it.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
How ya doing?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Shouldn't we turn away?
Well, spit it out.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Who is it Philip?
Son-of-a-bitch.
If you've got "a broad" available I'll take her.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
Phil.  What are you doing?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
No.
Whattaya mean family?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
What's she doin' here?
Club Zanzibar.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
What happened on the charges?
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Hasta siempre.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
You won't of missed much.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
You're perfect for me, too.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
You okay, honey?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Actin' funny how?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
You got me, peanut.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Oh shit...
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
That you, Sail, honey?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Sailor? You know what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Have it your way... But you want it.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Get rid of him?
Explain it... I told you.
You got nice tits.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
What?...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
You snore.
Emily?
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Yes.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
So -- what do we do now?
So whose car is it?
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
No...
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Vernon.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Really? That's remarkable.
You cold, James?
Can I ask you something about her?
Thank you.
The guy on the phone.
But... ?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Outside Scranton.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Kinship. And what's here?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
I just wanted a little sip.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
He cribbed that from Borges.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Not have it.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
Who's that sitting in your car?
The more the merrier.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Listen, Antonia --
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
No.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yo, Traxler.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Five years.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Then what? What?!
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
I'm just talking, man.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
What do you mean?
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
Were you watching me?
I would.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
The passionate one?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
But you are taking it?
People have the right to know.
I'm twelve.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
I'd like you to keep a journal.
How do they know?
I want to be normal!
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
To relax.
Who do you see?
Sorry.  Where is she?
Where?
How old are you and your sister?
A nap?
Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
It's going to take time, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
You're quiet at work.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
I'm not easily shocked.
Is that all?
Why do you want to know?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
I'm sorry, Walter.
We should live together.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Lord Almighty.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
But what did he see that made him panic?
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
He's got the shakes?
You totaled it, huh?
I don't know how!
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
He's convulsing!
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
He can still make it.
But where are you going?
Did you sleep well?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
What is that one over there called?
How wonderful!
There's no comparison.
Don't be so humble.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Good night, my love.
I don't love you.
Have you ever been in love?
It's divine!
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Please, you come too...
I'll stay here also.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Thank you.
Your mother?
Why have we stopped?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Of God.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
Why?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
He's told you?
Often?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
I don't know.
I went to my room.
What baby?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Don't you know?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What's your real name?
Would you like to be?
No questions.
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
What things?
How did she know that?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Is that what she said?
She's dead isn't she?
Yes?
Are you pretty?
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
I'm frightened.
Why?
Would you like to tell me?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Who?
Yes.
Is someone in the room with you?
She said Michael.
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Not your fault...
For what he made me go through.
She took the baby in her arms?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have it.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
No.
You can call me Sister.
I can beat that.
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
What man had access to her?
Could there have been anyone else?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
This was before her pregnancy?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
She is not a child.
???  
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
And my permission?
Because I am a moral person.
Would you like one?  Huh?
Fine thanks...
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
May I be present?
For Agnes.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Before or after you killed the child?
Well --
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
I don't snore.
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you pulling my leg?
I see.  Do you like the play?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
What are you doing?
What are they saying?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
No, that's his other one.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
I'll brook no denial!
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Hi Norm!
You are.
Aye, but you know him well.
He's betrayed the class.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Look after him.
He's been gone a long time.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Engines off.
Gravity?
Activate lifter quads.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Can we come up?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
You like this shit?
Okay.
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's really on there tight.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Yes.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
What's happening up here?
Don't count on it.
<u>What is it</u>?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
It's stopped?
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
How?
I thought I'd find you here.
Okay.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Martin?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Where did the parasites come from?
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
Where are you?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Let's hear it.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
I found it...
What's going on?
Listen to what?
De Vries?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
What happened?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
That's what we thought.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Thanks.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Six month stint on Datus.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
You're more than modest.
You take charge.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
You know me better than that.
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
We never met. That's why.
Feeling better, my dear?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Bill...
You've already met.
Macbeth.
When? When are you going to do it?
Knit me a muffler.
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Happy birthday, darling...
I'll check with Eve...
So she seems.
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
What fire and music?
Don't be condescending.
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
You think?
How do you do, my dear.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
You probably won't believe me.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
You're not going, are you?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
May I have your coat?
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Oh, but there is-
But the raves about your performance-
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
No, don't go...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
How far to the station?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
He's in love with you.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
That's on time for Margo.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Would you, really? How sweet-
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Call, what call?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
--what do you think?--
July of '71.
And?--And?--
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Morning or night?
Sure--off the record.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Five hundred; six maybe.
Hey, easy...
Something maybe big.
But they both worked at the White House?
What happens when the baby comes?
--I'm not your source on that--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
We can't talk inside either?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Talk about Segretti--
Your name, please.
Where in government?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Who's Colson, Harry?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Anything?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
No, it was good.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Good morning gentleman.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This.  Right now.
What do you suppose they're saying?
Me too.  For the most part.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Um...Chris --
What?!
Hi...
Stifler told me.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Onions?
What about the game?!
That's not why we're going out.
Are you kidding?  No.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
There's our man.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Dad!  I know!
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Yes.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
This was remade?  Into what?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
What's up, fellas?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You did it.
You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
No, not again.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
You sure you're comfortable?
Victoria...I love you.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
<u>Yeah</u>!
Here, babe.
Merde! Just missed!
The key is don't look down.
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Ha-ha!
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
God. I can't believe it.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
You recognize her?
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Andy!
What've you got?
Merde.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Hurry, Grandmama!
Noooo....
Is everyone all right?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Hurry up with those papers.
You're a princess...
The "Odessa Dunk"?
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Singer!
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
You're like New York. You're an island.
What do you mean, next?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
He was creepy.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Oh, sorry.
Uh, narcolepsy.
God bless.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
it's my first time.
Yeah?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Yeah?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
You- Do you love me?
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
You're so sure about it.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
and I keep, you know, it's-
I'm following you and David, if you-
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Yeah?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Check it out.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
God, it's so clean out here.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
What?
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Oh, you got a headache!
Where are you going?
Who said that?
Probably on their first date, right?
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Mean?
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Ah.
Yeah, watch the road!
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
You fired the cleaning woman?
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
M'mmm.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
It has your ring.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
What what's about?
I'm not.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
So?
It was fifteen seconds.
Yes.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
What?
Still champions.
It's an unfair advantage.
Truce.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Ah.
You got your DP?
Please, Ryan.
Something soft.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Scout's honor.
Lemon or raspberry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I think there are sixteen there.
I didn't say a word.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Well, yes, actually.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
What?
I...
I was impressed.
The charades.
That was my clue.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
She's all over him, are you blind?
Shit!
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Why not?
You're keeping a record, are you?
Monica and Ryan.
I didn't know you had this.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
She's such a great photographer.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
I order you to find out where we are!
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
So what makes you so special?
Why do they have you tied up here?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
Z!  what are you doing?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Yeah, I know.
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What did I tell you?
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Sure.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I forgive you.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Three.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
His apartment?
What's her first name?
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Cut.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Are you all right?
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Are we dressing for dinner?
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
The Vice Squad?
Where are you going, Baxter?
This?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Well -- I guess so.
Yeah --
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Don't mind what?
Very clever.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
No, no -- just had a little accident.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
You threatening me?
Good evening, Baxter.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
What's this -- you packing?
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Kubelik.
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Yes, I know.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Are you there, Fran?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
How about a drink ?
Winning the war by yourself.
That's good gin.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
How?
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
Can I go get those mangos now?
Flood.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Get in there !
Will they attack?
Touchy.
Spooky.
Yeah.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Fucking savages.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You think?
Captain Willard?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
Are you warm, Captain?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
Avalanche season is coming.
Let's go.
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
What happened here?
He's coming around fine.
Did you catch Corbett?
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Stay put!
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Told you I'm fine!
Don't push me..!
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
You better get some sleep.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
Getting loud, getting loud.
No... no thank you notes.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Hi.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
You wanna dance?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
And mean it...
You don't owe me that.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I'll take you... why not?
Grouchy?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Well...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
But what about...
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Oh, is he dead?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Go away.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
I carry bacon in my pocket.
That's very thoughtful.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Exactly what is your previous experience?
What?
Uh, Fontella's
No shit.
You can't --
Five million dollars?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Such language in front of a lady.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
You think this is a fucking joke?
What?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Why?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Electra.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
About?
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
I paid a lot for these.
That's right.
Yes.
Was that it?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Do you have ulcers?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Was she the only one?
When did it start?
I waited another four minutes.
I wasn't watching television.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Hi.  Did you call --
Would you like a drink?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Can I ask you a question?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Who's your friend?
Fifteen crowns.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Tell them we're working for the University.
I'm an idiot?
I've been saying that since we met.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
I'd love to get in there.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Like helping a sick kid?
We're going to need it all.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
Now you're using that word.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What do you want me to do?
Doug, I can't just leave you!
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
Hey Doug, where you been?
So, he didn't fire you?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
So go dance.
She asleep?
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
What if they expel you?
Why not?
It could help with a new car --
To see your father?
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I'm thinking.
Get yourself a glass.
You don't know me.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
'Is it really me?'
This play -- ?
You got some kind of list?
No problem --
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
What is that?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
How do you know this place?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What'd you tell your father?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Help me live until I die?
But if you could, you would?
What's Landon Carter up to?
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
This week.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
So what did we just make?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
How was school today?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Dad, you seen the drill?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Maybe if I used my left....
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Operator...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Catch you later! 
But Professor --
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
A gold mine?
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
That's just what I needed to hear.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Oh yeah?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
That's what he told you, huh?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You lost that one?
Oh yeah?
You like people?
Then why'd you do it?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Okay.
Hi.
My stomach's growling.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Don't call me stupid.
Why?
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
You smoke Pall Mall?
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Hi.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Then what?
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
What is this thing?  A fighter?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Got a casualty list?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
You keep an eye on it.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Pick those up, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Pictures don't lie.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Well... THIS.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
I don't understand-
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
...That's fine.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...This must be boring you.
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Yeah, but Charlie –
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Fink.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
Is this multiple choice?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
How's not smoking?
You okay?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
What are you doing here?
I'm De...
Was there anyone with you last night?
Did I miss something?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
You tell me.
I didn't.
How exactly did you hear?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Aren't you going to thank me?
What did you think?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
Do you believe me?
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
I hate rugrats.
Thanks.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Who are you?
Naa..
Of what?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Ouch..
What's with the wigs?
Who is it?
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
What are they?
A primate?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
She's good.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Drugs??!
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
What's that?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
You're a fast mover.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
So keep painting.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
... What do we do?
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
I don't.  So, no.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And a very, very good one.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Is there something wrong, sir?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
What is it?
Alfred, are you...?
Please be looking for me.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
This is easy.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Umm-hmmmm.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Winded, old timer?
No!?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
How about dangerous curves?
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
Master, Bruce?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
He's home. I sent the signal.
You are direct, aren't you?
I haven't had much luck with women...
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Mr...?
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
To kill me.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Like normal folks.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
I don't-.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Back off, man.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Holy shit.
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Is this what you wanted?
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Do you want a drink?
I don't sing very well.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Where does one man get all this junk?
Are they paying you for all this?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
What happened?!!!
It's very good Bernie.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
No!
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Maybe two cars.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
... in the distant future.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Uh, you first.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Beavis.
Does that say Xanax?
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Chief, look!
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Who sent ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
My God, we're back where we started.
Here's something.
I guess we open it.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Aren't you dead?
Handbook?  When...?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
We're very unhappy.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
Tell the truth.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Is there much more of this torture?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Hellooo!  How's school?
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
An attorney?
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Were you going somewhere?
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
... He walked off...
Oh. I have a message for him.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Oh, I like that very much.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I see.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Certainly, Ben.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
Good morning, Louise.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
1952...?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Good night.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Morning.
Enjoy.
Why, Craig. why?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maxine...
I know. I'm sorry...
Pardon?
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
Hi.
This is important!
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Let him try.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Vegas? What'd you think?
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Yes, my dear?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
But of course.
Oh, be still my heart.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
We have to meet.
What's the play?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Who's calling?
Can I get you a drink?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Darling!
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
You still there, sweets?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
You've got to be kidding.
Yeah what?!
Captain Mertin?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
There ain't.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
She gone like they say?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, good luck with the job.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Be here. In case.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
No. I mean work work.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Morning.
MAMA!
She likes this dress...
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
I know Denver.
The church!
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Sethe?
No, You looking good.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Where'd she been?
The Gundersons.
Sir, please lower your voice--
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
What's a pederast, Walter?
If what's during league play?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Heh-heh--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Which one was Logjammin'?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
I was talking about my rug.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
What happened to your house?
Increases?
Well...no, of course not--
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
This was, uh--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
No, but--
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Have it your way.  The point is--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
No.
Is this your homework, Larry?
It is a fucking emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Shit yeah!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Huh?
Fuckin' A.
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Who the hell is he?
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Two years.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
How does it look?
Nomak?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
She's been bitten.
Get in. You’re leaving.
What took you so long?
Don't try to talk --
Whistler, I --
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
You don't look so good.
Are you all right?
It won't work on you.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
That's weird --
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
How do you like that? Right on time.
You're a monster.
What -- ?
We keep in radio contact.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--and if she ever did--
Try, please, Anna--
What're you doing there?
Why?
No!
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--how old?
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
So says her website.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Your body, your call.
Anna--
I think we get the gist.
Just now?
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
Can't you like just divine it?
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
No fucking.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Mi casa y su casa!
Fire escape??
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Boy Kurth.
Yeah. Me too.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Oooh. Oooh.
Pointless.
What?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
She's far from "fine."
"It's why the witch kills children."
Why?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Thanks, Meurice.
Who was it?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Uh-huh.
...What?
...You called me this morning.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...But first I gotta know what happened.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What night is it?
What's the matter?
Sign.
What did you take these for?
Now that don't make much sense.
Dead, huh?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Not yet.
Can I feel 'em?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Don?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
. I. uh.
You like to open me. don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Dorothy. no!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
What else is new?. right?
What happened to him?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
What's the plan.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
O.K.
What did you see?
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
God. you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
No.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What's that?
Twenty-six months.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Diego Delgado, please?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
What's the matter, George?
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
I'm calling it three.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
There's no room.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
It's a family heirloom.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Yeah, maybe.
What are you going to do?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
You mad at me?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Hi.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
How are you doing, George?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
Source?  What about Derek?
Do I know you?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
No, that's alright.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I fucked up.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
It's not enough.
Nice weed, huh?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
But I haven't shot him.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Read it.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Why?
What is she saying?
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
I think I'm going to make your day.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
What did they argue about?
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.
That's ridiculous.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Can I go?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
And how are you now?
Why did she say she was leaving?
She was.
Why?
Did you suggest any?
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
I heard him say it.
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
Three fifteen.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Hi, Joe.
Frank!
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Is it against the law?
What do you think?
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Why would she lie?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Rebecca -- take these off.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Because I'm expecting a call.
The witness will answer the question.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
I can back it up.
If you want me to.
What's she like?
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Well, that's a long time.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Nobody did.
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
She's changed.
Not this kind of heat.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Oh. When did you move back?
Lemon?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Is the dizziness gone?
Help cook?
What?
You drink bug repellent?
When?
Francesca?
So what happened?
My mistake. I apologize.
I would love to come for dinner.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Uh-huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
What do you want me to say?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
What time is it?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I'm positive.
Okay.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Shit.
Is this Hell?
What else?  Money.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
You know I can't.
How do you know?
And you believe her?
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Where is this going, Johnnie?
The money!
We know how this was done, eh?
Not bad.  What for?
They were early.
They just left, didn't they?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
I need you ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
You murdered Gino!
But everybody is all right.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Where is it?
You can't kill me yet.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Is that the money?
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
'63 Chevy.
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
What?
It's in a case, on his desk.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
okay, all right.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
You're a U.S. Citizen?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
We thought you were gone for good.
What if I say no?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
He came to kill us.
Oh, Jesus...
-- we'll explain it --
xxxxxx
And that's it?
Can I help you?
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What?
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
What if it doesn't come back?
I think we'd better have a look.
Er ... Thanks ...
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
You are late.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Enough though, eh?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Tell me about Layton.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Trust me.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Look at that - right on time.
Will you please turn back.
Turn!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Don't you like parties?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
That's it.
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
My mother said it would be all right.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Whatever happened to you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Hello ... hello ...
Yes?
I mean it fixed itself.
What the - ? How did you - ?
What?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
For God's sake, what's happened?
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
Where is she?
She asked me to pick her up.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Here, you try.
Do you have any music?
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I think this place stinks.
Not as good as Nino's.
Five years.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
What do you think?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Whatja doing?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Okay.  Great line at the end.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
What happened?
Watch? --
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
How'd it go?
Did it really go well?
Do you feel good about it?
How?
Let's go...
Yes.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
Play back the last line...
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Because...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Yes.  How do you know?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
So he was indicted?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
It's incredible who's here.
At least kiss me when you do that.
Okay.  Good night.
I don't wan to discuss work.
Take it easy.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Where's the bathroom?
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Did you hear what he said?
I mean, you look so pretty.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
Now what kind of statue was that?
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Yeah.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
It's hot in here...
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Oh, OK.
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
It's coffee.
I... feel.... pretty.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
He doesn't look fifty.
Something like that.
What show is this?
You broke up with my machine?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Well, stay here tonight.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
Dress, huh?  What for?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
Like what?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Just stay away from me, okay?
I was a slave.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
Ow.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
No -- you don't have to --
But you threw a knife at my head!
Put your head back.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
What!?!
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
Five?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
How can you keep doing this?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
So very much.
Why?  Why me?
The mark of the Coven.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
And Spring Fling.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
What are you talking about?
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
You said "Crash".
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Just till I lose.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Neither will I.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Don't tell anybody.
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
Why baseball?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
You a God damn witch?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
Nuke--  Good luck.
Crash Davis?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
I don't believe in fighting.
No way.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Who ain't?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Well, I'd rather not say.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
A powerful man.
You got it.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
Oh, good.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
No, of course not.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
What?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
All right.
My wife?
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
She was afraid to call you.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
It's always been our policy -
To Abraham Lincoln.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
...pit bosses, floor managers.
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
You can't make me stop caring...
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
To the Riviera.
Why do you want to do that?
I was with somebody.
Fuck you.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Now you need approval from him to go home?
Don't you threaten me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
Is this yours? Your pen?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Yeah.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
What expenses?
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Can I go in?
And here. Here.
Oh.
And I mean... that's no good.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Uh-huh. Good.
Hi, Jennifer.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
Yes, you did.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Great.
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Well, how 'bout that?
Do you know that?
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
We'll go later.
He's sittin' by the phone -
They checked in alone.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here, come here.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
They're havin' a good time too.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
I know. I know.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
I'm positive.
I know it, I know it.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What a "drag."
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
How much?
Good morning.
Hey, Captain God!
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
What's this?
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Any minute.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I don't want to know --
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Tell me what she looks like.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
It won't be him.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Yes?  Yes?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
What's that supposed to me?
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Know what else is in here?
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
What time frame have you got in mind?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Negative.
And not a nickel.
Count it.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Seems not.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
You could always make it up to her.
What you think?
He agreed that he was.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
You all right?
He's getting up.
What's that about?
Why?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Would you like a drink?
What'll it be?
You mean that?
Come on, Dil --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
You could?
Sure I do.
Will you meet me again?
Kind of wish I didn't.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Happy now?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Don't call me that --
Are you all right, Dil?
Died...
You didn't.
You tried.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
More endearments.
And you'll never leave me?
Meet Col --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Hey -- what's he like?
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Jude?
Who's the old geezer?
Give him a cup of tea.
Why would you do that?
Why?
You OK about that?
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Why do you want to do that for?
You sure about that?
Fuck you.
I seen your fucking face.
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Why not?
What the fuck am I doing here.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
I didn't.
Don't know her.
What?
What?
Like the one about the frog?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
You stupid bastard --
What?
What if I did?
Give me the shooter, Jude --
What are you talking about?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
No -- I guess not.
Oh, you should see your face.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Reggie -- stop!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
Then say it.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
That's the spirit.
It's Charles!
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Bartholomew?
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
Sorry about that.
Keep going.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
You can't.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Or Tex?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
The money is unimportant.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
About how wealthy would you say?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
How's that?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
How did you find out?
Where did everything go?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Who said?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
What?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Yes -- that's right.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
What's he up to?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
is there anything you do?
It's almost ten o'clock.
You're grounded Friday night!
Hi honey.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Hi honey.
A little.
You know her?
You were eavesdropping.
What did you hear?
No!
Of what?
No.
I know where you're going.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Someone tried to kill me.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
What are you doing?
Lisa Sherman?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Kenny's aunt?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.

Come on, Night Shift.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Great. 
That's my business.
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
What did I say?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
All right, then how about this?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
That dog ain't mean.
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck! That's...
...the ice cream for money!
 
Take your gun!

Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
...I'm not the psycho.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...

Oh, shit.
...up!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
...do we?
Come on.
Come on...

Hang on!

All right.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Oh, no!


...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
...shit.
A-And you  owe me...
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Come here.
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Oh, fuck!
Okay...
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Oh!
Hey.
Be cool.  Be--


But...
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You got a prob-...
Yes, sir.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Andrew...
No, go--
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
I can't say it's a surprise.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...


Of which we have more than enough.
Vaughn.
This was supposed to be a...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
....-lene.
Assumptions are always...
Doc...
Not tonight...
...the river.

No.


I would've in another life.

Rangers.
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Thanks. 
...-time. 
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...without caution...
...fishin'.
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
 ...miles. 
You find yourself wearing a...
...you answer mine.
Lying? 
Let me see your...
I said let me see your hands now!
...tunnel now!
What the hell was that?
 
 Talk to me.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
How did she get that idea?
What for?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Haven't the faintest idea.
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
She's just no good.
...No...
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Off the alley.
That's just lovely.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
I don't want it anymore.
Isn't that your number?
I want the rest of the pictures.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Give you three minutes.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
No.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
K... Cross.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Oh, yeah?
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
It was in Chinatown.
Working for the District Attorney.
As little as possible.
...No. Why was it.
What about it?
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
She's too upset.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you get some sleep?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Going somewhere?
That's good. Now what's her name?
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Walsh here?
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Who?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
The water.
Come again?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
No, really?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He did or he didn't?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Yes. I want proof.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
But...who...
Elena!...But when...
So what'd they say?
You're still beautiful...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
My husband...you know him.
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
I might make him nervous.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Who else you been to see?
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
And the notice?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
We haven't heard from him.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Ow!
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
You're very easily amused.
Where's the towel?
How old did you say you were?
Is that what you want to do?
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
I'm going to leave you.
Goodbye, Charlie.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
They do it only because you do!
You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Thompson!
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Are you sure?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
What's this?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I'm giving him his ring back.
I just told you.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
How'd you get here so fast?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Then who operated the store?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
What smells like shoe polish?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Eight and a half.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Allan Harris.
She's in here?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
No.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Julie Dwyer died.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
Shit. What about tomorrow?
She meant nothing to you!
Oh, my god.
You know.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Her fucking body fell out!
Let me borrow your car.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
You're kidding.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Lovely story.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Go open the video store.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
You used to go out with her?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
Ooh! Can we?!
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
You've only had sex with three different people?
What do you mean?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Well...?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
You had to tell him.
It was only a few times...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
It stings a little.
No way!
I beg your pardon!
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
Dental School.
I will. Take it easy.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Answer the man.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
You know how the airlines are.
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
She's losing it!
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
We'll never know, will we?
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
What are we going to do?
Two...
Do you see them yet?
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
The winds are picking up.
Where've you been?
A flare up...
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
Gabe!?
Let's be creative.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Never, what?!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Thanks for holding on.
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Take the rope.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Oh, my God!
Travers!  Hurry it up.
What's the delay?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
He's alive!
What's the code, Travers?
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Appreciate it.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Yes. They want to help.
Fine, sir, fine.
What would you like to know, sir?
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good.
Where is he now, sir?
Surprise?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
I wanna be sick.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Religion?
No, sir.
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Are you referring to the background score?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Carry on, Chief.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Max, the cab driver!
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
What?
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Hi, Ma.
I got caught up at work.
I brought you flowers.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
It's home.
You on some kind of work plan?
You should start a union.
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
How about the thingy next to it?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
You said you were visiting friends!
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Get rid of 'em.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Who's Heller?
It's what I do for a living.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
I never told her.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
That's it?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
What are you doing?
Has this happened to you before?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
He's why you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
What is it?
At a horse show.
How'd you get the picture?
Liza?
And you feel bad for it?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Yes.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Agent Lowry.
What?
We've lost contact.
There's no plug to pull.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway --
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
You aren't staying?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
How can that be?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
Dr. Cullers?
Can't we get rid of them?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
You're not real.  None of this is.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
And in return?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
But the work --
Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
What day?
Do you love your parents?
I don't think so.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Ellie --
What?
Hi.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Go git it, Luke.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Whatcha got?
Lucille? Where do you get that?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Luke. Where you goin?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Man Oh Man.
I hate this...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
When are you going to call them?
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
Who are you?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Where is it?
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Would you want to work with us on this?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
We've got another one.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
What happened to you?!
Who's the married man?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
I don't want this.  What are they?
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
Don't hang up!
You know how to use this?
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
What's wrong with him?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
What's Abba?
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
How about I put Nikko on it?
I just got here myself, Susan.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
What!? They brought the car here?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
You haven't told me where we're going.
So - why the airport?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
You're kidding.
Crash victim?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
What about this one?
It'll be fine.
What do you think?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
But what am I going to do?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Yes?   Go right ahead.
What have you done with the ring?
A small price.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Well?
Just checking.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Wow.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Michael.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
The store was busy.
I think I should go home.
What?
I guess we need to talk.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
I guess I should go now.
Forget I asked.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Sure. Why?
No.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Getting back.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
Where are the tapes?
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Why is everything an argument with you?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Guns.   Can you get them?
I'm from Belgium.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Everything.
What'd you guys find?
The map said to go left.
They don't have a wine list.
I knew I should have driven.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
How do we know what room she's in?
Algeria.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
She seems pleasant enough.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
You're back!
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Tell me, who is your master?
I'm tired now.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
Where is he now?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Give it back!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
What was it?
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
Don't you want to see her again.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
It's Jade Fox!
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
No onions though, okay?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Mom --?
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
What's going on...?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Get it?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
...necklace... pearls...
We've got company.
Who got himself what?
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
So what year are you going into?
You a lesbo?
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
I sincerely doubt it.
How's the water?
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
And you promise to abide by it?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
You don't know how to love.
But you knew this was important to me.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
German.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Those are my letters!
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Did you hide the letters?
I look terrible.
Where are you going?
Don't you want to change that?
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Yes!
Is she with you?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
What's wrong?
Why not?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
You amaze me.
Who are you spying on?
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
Not at all. What's wrong?
I can't thank you enough.
Did she show up?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
What are saying, darling?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You're shouting at me.
Ollie.
It's your play.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Where did you mail them?
Daddy!
I've wanted a friend.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Oh, how beautiful!
But why?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
I like stories.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Can't you get contacts?
Or if there's a full moon.
Where?
Hey, did you get contacts?
At least your PMS is over.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
What the fuck are we going to do?
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
What?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
When's the last time you saw him?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
I really gotta get going.
Everything okay?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
I think I'm a werewolf.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What kind of animal?
His wife.
They don't speak English...
Please, they'll kill me...
Lost something?
What now?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
But...  How long has this been happening?
Someoneís after me.
Donít kill me!
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
How do you know I'm innocent?
Holy cow.
For a month.
The Washington Post.
.. Nothing.
Don't call the Vice President!
I don't give a shit.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
When does it break?
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What I told him to?
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Gimme a quarter.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Alan...
`Dave'?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
You got a gun?
Who?
Well...
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
I care about the homeless.
Look.  If there was some mistake...
... . Ellen.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
How were you gonna get home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
I know. I'm sorry...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I never thought I'd...
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
The Monroe?
Then why did you come here?
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
What is it?
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
What?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Yeah!    Don't you guys miss having girls here?
I think he's sweet.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, he's your roommate.
What happened?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
It's all right, Chet.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Knox, I don't believe this!
But I love you.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What?
What?
So?
Come on, that's impossible.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Put more into it!
Who are you?
They are...they are everywhere.
And what? These things are octopusses?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
I'm not staying here!
You don't have to be so touchy.
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Got it?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
You want ME to go up there?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Joey...it's okay...
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
Man, don't go up there...
She's gone...
Where are you going?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Who's going?
Damn right!
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Who's full of shit?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
I thought that was it.
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
You're back.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
No, I --
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Where's it gone?
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
You Biederman?
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
How are you?
You seem... disturbed.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
You think we'll ever come back?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
What?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Down I would say... What would you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You're working a partner on this.
I don't want to hear anymore.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
You okay?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Hey, buddy...
How then?
Why?
You need anything else?
You want to be a good detective?
Wanna try?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You be careful.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
You all right?
I'm going to be a policeman.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Belle --
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Anybody can see that.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
But I like the new one better.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Stevens!
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Your butter money?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
It feels fine now, Jabez.
But I'm glad to be home again --
Worried!
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Mary! Come back ...
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Ma -- is she? --
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Sheriff.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
You're very perceptive.
The code key, please...?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
New York...
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
How long?
...I've missed you.						*
Yeah.  How'd you know?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al?  Al, you there?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Is that him?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
He wanted to kill me!
You're full of shit ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
What's the matter with you?
Howard, give him the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Mister Mulvaney?
You got Bank Americard?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
I used to, but I stopped.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
... The bodies out the door.
He wants one.
Sal?
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Oh - Maria!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Newsman, not ...
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
What is it, Choco?
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Hello?
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
<i>The FBI was breathing down Lateesha's neck... and she assumed that they were onto our scam. So she set up some college kids to take the fall for the heist. They have been under FBI surveillance for the past 6 months.</i> <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN </b> Claremont drives like a maniac.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
I've already formulated a plan.
Hello?
I don't know.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
Is that the decoder?

I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
We are so fucked.
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
You the man.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
No!
Where did you sleep?
I hope the block is still standing.
Eddie Lovell.
Jade.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
...peanuts.
This might take some time.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
It's dug.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Hot.  Hot.
Tina, you are too slick.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Be a man.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
I don't know.
I'll do that.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Get the broom.
How do you know this?
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
Turn it off.
I didn't think so.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Take it easy, Pop.
You're it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
You did?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
O'clock?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
What are you wearing?
Okay.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
I will stop this car right now.
Nice jugs.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
...cause you said...
According to the map, we're just about at school.
What?
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
You have beautiful eyes.
A raft.
Cute puppy.
I made the polar bear pants.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Why ith dat newth?
What?
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
I am strong!
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
You said "aloha" twice.
Times two.
What papers?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
Yes?
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Is he....?
The Water of Life.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Should I call a doctor?
Bela, are you ready?
You'll be sitting on the right.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Don't you have any savings?
What happened?!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I've never seen anything like him!
Um, okay... roll camera
What do you think you're doin'?!
Wow.
I don't understand.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Goddamn landlord.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Mr. Wood?!
Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
Hey!  You're not eatink.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
What is happening?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
What are you making?
You look beat.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
I'm really sorry...
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
You're sure this is gonna work?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
B-but it's our money --
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
How you doing, Ed?
Uh-huh?
They tore her dress! ...
He's who we want to go with.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Mr. Pekurny.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
No. It's a mess.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
He had girlfriends!
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
St. Joseph's.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Hi. Is Shari here?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
What does this mean?
How much less?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Yeah...
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Are you sure about this?
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Shari, I really like you...
So...?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Kinda'.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
You would do this? You would actually --
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
All right.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
You brought the girl!
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
No -- keep it.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Hi.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ohhh...
How?
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
NO, that's fine
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I guess you know why you're here
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Hello, Mr. M.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Where to?
Plenty of pep, too.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
I don't believe you.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Yeah.  I'm here.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
What?
People can see this.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Now could you leave me alone?
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Did you talk to Exley?
In the morning.
Yeah, I hate them.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
That's him.  That's him.
How's it going to look on your report?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
You expecting problems?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
You wanted to meet here?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you mean?
More or less.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Yes, I do, sir.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You're the key witness?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Lynn Bracken.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Do you have any proof?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Around.
Shut up!
Brill?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
You knew the deal. No contact.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
Jesus!
I didn't use my name.
None of your business.
I intercepted phone calls.
That is one ugly sunrise.
They're here.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
It's a little late for that.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Your stuff?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
For your wife?
Hey.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Have you been working with Rachel?
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know.
Good.
Are you sure you're safe?
Is it over?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
I can't.
What makes you think it's you?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Listen--
Gentlemen--
Who would do that?
Bobby--
Yeah.
No, but they took my blender.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Are you okay?
You think there was a connection to--
Then what's your goddam opinion?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
Who?
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Now is that clear?
Daskylus…
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
You felt obliged to.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
This is - what is this?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
It hurts too much.
Shall we be all right?
Oh dear.
A broken car?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Well, then ask him his name!
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Top Hat.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Are you asleep?
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
He needn't disturb you.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
No. But he hands them over.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once… He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
You've got a mustache.
Or my wife's.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
The windows don't open.
That's doable.
You don't call, you don't write.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
I have a question...
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
I don't want to waste your time.
Oh?
Maybe I should drive this time.
But--
You stole my luggage? You--
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
And good morning.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Aren't we early?
And--
Camera in the--
We're working.
They moved it.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
What?
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Parachute.
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
Not for me.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
What's wrong.
--You're a cop.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
In the van.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
You two make quite a couple.
Tonight your league night?
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
See you.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
What the hell is this doing here?
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Oh, my God.
Five million dollars?
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
What are you doing here?
I don't get why they'd do that.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
What do you mean?
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
She insulted me!
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
How many counts?
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
You've been reading for hours.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
She's one of the sick people?
Whose number do you need?
Annabelle Daniels.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Cause I don't even know you.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
That's Ed.
More than you need me.
You already packed up your stuff?
I don't do favors for you anymore.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
Where's my paycheck?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Will he finish what he begins?
I can't ...
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks his concern.
... the power?
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Because of my father, I guess.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Our destruction?  Who?
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
You, too, golden rod.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
What are you afraid of?
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
I was worried about you.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What'd you say?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
A tremor!
Leia!
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Will they die?
Did you call the Zoo?
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
With food?
Where is he?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Location.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
How do you know all this?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Who?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Arthur.
What book is that?
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Why can't you be my champion?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Me?
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It is.
You are truly magnificent!
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
Oh, I see.
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Is it coming out Willie?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Lies?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Chris MacNeil?
Pretty close?
Did he tell you about my party?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Have you told him what's happening?
What kind of stuff?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Wait a minute you need two.
Captain who?
Oh I bet he is.
Mr. Dennings?
I don't want it.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Lieutenant?
You just missed them.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
Shut up!!
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
It's my goddamn car!
Trunks?
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong with them?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Piano.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Jack.
You look awful.
Seeing anyone in particular?
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
I made her nervous.
Frank?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Where the hell is she?
Awe inspiring.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
I thought we had separate rooms.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Really.
What're you doing down here?
The Royal.
April.
What?
You weren't there.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
The audience was a little off tonight.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
What do you mean?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
So?
When?
Ready?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
It's orange!
Come on.
Nine!
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
You're kidding me.
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Don't worry about it.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
It went well tonight.
Fucking.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Forget it.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
How do you do it? Every night?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nina?
He had a mind that escalated things.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Jack.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Oh?
How'd the show go?
Jack.
None?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
What did he do?
He's lying.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Pollux ...
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Hello?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Well, Alan, I think we’re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Where do I go now?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
I’m having kind of a bad day.
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Where’s my car?!  Where’s my Ferrari!?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Hello!
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
Excuse me?
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
This place is a perk, Kate.
What’s going on?
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
I found it!
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
And where do we think we're going?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Stop it.
Sweet.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
You said it was urgent.
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Wish I knew why.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Look at that...they're changing color...
A surgeon might...
No need to get up --
Such as?
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Yes, there is.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
One of us pays the other for half.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
How ya doin'?
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Well... yah.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Stan Grossman called.
Norstars.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
How ya doin', Wade?
No kiddin'?
We're good to loan in.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
...Well, that passed.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Geez! You look great!
...This is a nice place.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Oh. Geez.
Hon?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
And his wife?
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
You need to lighten up.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
You're kidding.
I want brain parasites.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
You... don't have to... leave.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
When?
No.
What did you say... ?
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
You got about thirty seconds.
Marla...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
What list?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I know that.
What are you reading?
You?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
You get rid of her.
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Tyler...
Four in Milwaukee.
What about Marla?
...stop me?
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
Fuck you.
Ask me nicely.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Why... why... why... ?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Look at me...
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Really?
What are you doing?!
Yeah, how?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
No!  It can't be.
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
May we come in?
Take a guess.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Whoa, nine months?
Shouldn't we pull over?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
What is it?  What are you?
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
It's only the end of June.
That... him?
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Remember the departure time?
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Wow!
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Batteries not included.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
How you doing, Brewer?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
You never been in one of those things.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Why'd they want us?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
I do?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Stay on your heading, Captain.
What's up?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
This your stuff?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
What?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
Hello....congratulations.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Free?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
I need a drink.
A quest?
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Happily married, probably.
In a bar called Hellfire.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Well, it's enough for me.
Excuse me...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Sure...
Sure you don't want anything?
Alaska.
Hey, mack!
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No. We have tomatoes.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I don't make the rules.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
You want me to hold the chicken.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
I just can't look at you.
You always do this to me.
Sorry.
Oh.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Well...  I better let you...
What questions?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Like what?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where is she, anyway?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Catherine...
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No inner feeling.
Where are you going?
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Robert, I think you better just...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
And what about love?
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
Well...
Mass production is what does it.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
What?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
I think he's 18 or 17.
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
How do I know you're not lying.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Maybe tonight?
You're lucky.
Fletch.
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
You can't keep me here.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
So where do you know Alan from?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Thought so. What for?
Are you all right, Doctor?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Are you serious?
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Ten days ago?
John Ultramalensky, right?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I'm the Sufi.
Sure you did.
I'm still here.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
John who?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
You were in the war?
Can I ask you a question?
Are you still in love with Alan?
Thanks for the great time.
Who.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
So you're saying she moved out.
Tell the cops.
Fletch.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Who?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
I have some ideas.
How could you call him?
I was upset.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Actually, you may take it all now.
That was close...
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
How'd you get this from her?
You okay?
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
Three hundred.
Let's get serious...
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
I can't kill this kid's father...
Are you okay?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
Like me.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
Kill them.  Not quickly.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
I'm still the king!
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
This isn't music!
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Where are you?
Sal --
What?
It's your problem.
It's beautiful.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Des Moines.
Why not?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
When ya go back on?
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Popeye.
You got the warrant?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
You're shitting me!
It looks open on the other side.
You give him his drops?
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Where are you transmitting from?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
That's impossible.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What?  What is it?
She just died, your mother just died?
What are you talking about?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
What do I tell them?
How?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Please, Dad, just do it.
John, you there?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
You're not looking too good.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
She makes ten.
Got a minute?
So how'd you like LION KING?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Are you a good cop, John?
Fuck you, asshole.
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Why don't we go take a swim?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
What happened that night?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Faster!  Eat faster!
See anything?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Darren, we better turn around.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
I thought Jason was only a legend?
But what if they try and scare us?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Look --
Look, I don't want your money!
What do you want?
You need to leave.
Hello...
Jesus!
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Why did you want her body?
Tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
About Jessica.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
That's disgusting.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
A major prick.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
What are you going to do?
That was truly excellent.
Did you hear that?
Where's the radio?
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
What are you doing??
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
I...I can't...
You pushed me...
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Very dangerous.
It's just a review.
What happened eighteen months ago?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
He carries a gun.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
What do you mean?
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Is it?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
She is kicking you out.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What else?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
What else?
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Where the hell are you?
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
You're charming the boy.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
I hate the Mets.
You've worked with Elliot?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Would you like to meet him?
Is it true?
What? Come on, Paisley.
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No violence, please.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
They're sparing no one, I see.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
No?  What's keeping you?
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
At least it's nothing contagious.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
I have to know where you come from.
You wish.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
It's all right.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
How was your evening?
Will you be okay?
How the hell did you get here.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What about the car?
I can't.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
Flight got you nervous?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The doctor will give you something.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
The name?  For the certificate.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Where do you want to go?
Where did you get those?
Where did you get them developed?
You go out much?
$250,000 right off the top.
I didn't. I just waited.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
I mean it.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
He must have.
Do you mean that?
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
That would be the first time.
No scars?
No more about Beynon.
Things can't get much worse can they?
How long before this car's hot?
Are we going to make it?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
Where we go in1?
Let's just get to the border.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
What's the damage?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
Oh ay?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
No, don't Jack, don't.
It is. Honestly.
Yes, while he was here.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Tell me about the girl.
And you didn't know her last name?
Have another?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Sorry about your father.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
That must be interesting.
Don't know.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
What is it?
Is he staying the night?
I'll call the police.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
So shut up.
Did you sleep well?
No chance of that.
You coming back?
Meaning what?
Oh, you've been watching television.
What's it to you anyway?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Not suede boots!
Three hundred altogether?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You did?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
They did.
It's too...
I...
...that's right...
Shoes, boots, yes...
No.
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You...
No.
Did you?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
You're actually talking about this?
Yes.
What?  What?  The leads.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
Me?
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
It is dead.
Everything I...you know...
I am?
He said he filed...
He said we...
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
You have nothing to hide.
Will you excuse...
Did the leads come in yet?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
Shelly: get in the office.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Mmm.
Who told you...?
Moss...Who told him?
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
Would you come in here, please?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...I only...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Under him?
Yes.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
I will close.
What are we going to say?
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now?  Now?
Is that what you're saying?
Mmm.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
It was his idea.
I've got the check...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Shelly...!
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Rick...?
Who did she call?
What would have elapsed?
No.  She told me "right now."
What...?  Say the words.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
You cashed the check?
Fuck you.
You just this morning...
Have a good trip.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Yes.
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Three?  I count two.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Bought at the airport.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I don't want to stay here...
Ready, Frankie.
We were all upset about that.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
Beautiful.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Where's my wife?
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Good.  Then you're staying.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
This committee owes an apology!
Yes.
Why too late?
On a plane back to Sicily.
No, I meant lose his family.
However I can help you...
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Rosato, where's your brother?
You want a war?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
You did not know?
What have you done with him?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
I never thought you were.
What way might that be?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
What was that about?
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Let's get out of this funk hole
It's not like her.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
I never made it to Korea.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
I can undress myself, thank you.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Where's Betty?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
He is not going to kill the old man?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
My monsters?
How are you?
What about?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I'm just here about my brother.
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
How's that?
You have my word...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
I'm on the move -
What's wrong with it -- ?
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
Donny --
You guys have any skills at all?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
oh.
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
You goin' home?
You okay -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Nah. It's a scratch.
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
Come here --
Where you off to -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Now what -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
And here I am...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
Ready -- ?
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
Unlock your button ...
She does have one thing you don't.
The hard part ...
Is he still working here ?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Talk? To you? After what you did!
My bag. My bag.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Then you're safer in here.
What happened? You okay?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She didn't do it again did she?
How'd you know where to find me?
I guess so.
Okay.
Is that true?
How much money you got?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Will you take a check?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Good to meet you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Can we do it at my office?
Would you excuse us?
Seems like it's going well.
Jobs doing what?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Do you know when you'll be back?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
I could go for a Whopper.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Tell me what you really think.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
No.
Well, are you going out again?
My wife's dead.
My wife's dead.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
What?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Oh, I know.
No. Thank you.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
You grew up around here?
Why do we always stay here?
When?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
How's it goin'?
Just for fun?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Do you play the piano?
Will? Are you awake?
Come with me to California.
Yeah.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
I'd come back--
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Short fella. Pale face.
Want to work?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Government.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Excuse me for asking.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Is it fur?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
What's the matter? What's happened?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Get to what?
I stay in my own yard.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Look, Ma!
Didn' you get no sleep?
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
They know he got hit in the face.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
Yeah?
You can have this for ten cents.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Here we go!
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
But what about this?
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Morning.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
Remember high school?
It's me. Martin Blank.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
What am I gonna do?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Jesus...
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Seven it is.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Will you come with me?
You kill people. 
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Hello, Bob.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I have scruples. Next.
This is not good.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I bought a new rug.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
No, I don't have one.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Marty! It's me. Paul.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Poor thing.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
What?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Why should they?
Yes. We're suing.
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Aw... that's so sweet.
Why did you go?
What did he say?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
What if she doesn't want to go?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
You don't seem to upset?
Of course not.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
I don't believe it.
Tom?
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
Why do you always wear that hat?
She gonna be long?
What does she do?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Sure?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Welcome to our show!
What's that?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Who's that?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Dead.
What did we learn in school today?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
I found it! I found it!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
You what?
Shit!!
Alright, so what have we got?
There they are!
I can't believe they decided you won.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Phreak?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
What's going on?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Shit!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
An accident?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
Honey, I don't think their home.
Because the lights are all out.
Four plus Myers.
Yes.
Who you calling?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Hi.
Come on Rachel.
What?
Had enough?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Get the outside shutters.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Something?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Thank you.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
What?
He was standing right here.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Hello?
I've already lost it.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Get him out of here!
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Want a beer?
We're all alone, aren't we?
A man wouldn't do that...
Exactly what do you need?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Not any more.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Laurie, you come with us...
Hello.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Wow, it's the red one?
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
How about you?
Yeah, you would.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Isn't that beautiful?
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
It's so late.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
I am... I did slave all day.
So?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
But you don't have any symptoms!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Come on.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
What are you talking about?
You promised to stay on the wagon.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Perfect!
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Ohh?
Sometimes she's terrific...
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, God...
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Good.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
I was so bored!
I'd never do that.
So how are you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Really?
When'd you get here?
Dad...
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Why are you so upset?
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I'm looking for...
...very good.
We could skip the Gavotte.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
You want to get married...?
First things first.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
<u>Do</u> it...
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
..It won't be long now, sir...
And how would you know that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Why?
Sir:
I am all attention.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waited too long, hon...?  
Waal...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
How could you know?
...Franklin.
Make them eat the figurine.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
And you let her get away.
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...I'm sorry....?
You want another drink, honey...?
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Look what they put her on...
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Hello....?
Thank you.
...what a lovely perfume.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
...sir...?
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Howdy Pouty.
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Yeah. I guess I do.
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Don't say that.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Gee, thanks.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
I was talking with someone!
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Guess who?
I said I was sorry.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Veronica, you look like hell.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
It doesn't work on small animals!
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Did you miss him completely?
Did to.
The bomb, asshole!
You two....
You two....
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
Look, Mother!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
looks startled at the outburst.
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Just a couple more . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Poor Father . . .
I'm coming with you.
Mummy!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Bye, Dad.
Isn't it beautiful!
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
Sure plenty of times.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
What did you just say?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
That was cold...
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
You're alive...
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
What evidence?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
What's under that sheet...?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
Nothin'.
I...
Bill, listen...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Underbelly!
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
You were... very... inspiring.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
What's the matter?
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
How'd it go?
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Give it here, Bernard.
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
As long as you keep remembering why.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
I should.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
And?
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Where'd he go?
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
And it's a shorter commute.
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
His secretary just confirmed.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
Who was that?
I think it's time I came home now.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
Just reduced.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Do you see a man?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
Detective Bedsoe.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
Sing.
What are we doing here?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
It will be a good harvest this year.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Sometimes.
Why?
Huge.
You're hurt.
No.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Where will you go now?
He's in there!
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
You know it's not safe here for you.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Is there anything else you need?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
You get anything on Smith?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Jesus.  What is this?
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
That you, Talley?
We been through that.  Forget it.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
What the fuck is that?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You got something to say?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Mine, too.
What?
You gotta pee?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's enough.
That's not enough.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
What's wrong with the radio?
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
I think so.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Ten.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
He did.
We must go to the Diplomat.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You will tell them the truth.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Very good.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Very soon.
Perfect timing.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Who did you call?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I will need a suite.
Let's have dinner first.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Has Roger spoken yet?
They are being evacuated.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to stay.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Rutaganda's place?
What is this about no water?
All. What do you mean all?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Why the hurry, Roger?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
What are you playing here, Price?
Melissa!
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
What's down there?
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Then what the hell are we doing here?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Could we have a word?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- and who's next on your list?
No...
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
First time for everything.
Please! Something! Oh-God!
I think...I may have the answer.
House 2, Guests 0.
It works.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Damn it.
Did you find something?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Town records are coming up now.
Are you all right?
Good-bye.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
What the hell is that?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
...set up some more things.
But do you agree with me?
Oh come on!
Maura, what is this!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I think we should do it.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
The rain is letting up.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Hello?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Why are you so interested?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
What?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Every day.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Joey ... ?
Thank you.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
JP?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Oh, I don't ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
Looks like you've been expanding your...
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Count of three?
Now that's a lock.
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Alex, are you....
How.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
And I'll bring my entourage...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Cat got his tongue?
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Get away from there, convict!
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
...Hello?
Hungry, anyway.
You're from Muncie?!
Sid found me the icepack.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I filed it yesterday.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
I got big ideas, though!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...Geez.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
...This'll only take a moment.
How's that, Sid?
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
...and awduhs a light lunch.
He don't look wise.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
I think you need some help.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
-- But, you're an American?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I suppose so.  Yes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
Investigation of what?
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
Good night.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I... I think I am...
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Well?
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
I'm fine dad.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
What you been up to?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Good shit.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I suppose. Why?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Oh.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
How can you do that man?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Where you going?
I don't ever want to see you.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
How are the parental units functioning these days?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Right.
Well, you can...
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Good.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
She your only sibling?
How much closer would you say you were?
Duggar called him?
It's legitimate.
No.
Randy Stetz?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Will...I...
Did you love her?
You heard me that time.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I don't know.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Hey...
You and Kay were like sisters?
It was like some big fucking secret!
No game.
Oh?
You gave her gifts.
Monstrous.
Your lips, they didn't move.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
No, my beloved, my child.
But why?
We want no quarrel with him.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
More.
Why always on this night?
You made us what we are, didn't you?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Why does he call you that?
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
Do you think I would let them harm you?
What have I done?
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
The girl, Lestat -
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Karaoke -- perfect.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Julie...
What do you mean?
I'm holding your hand!
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
The shower again?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
You sure it's okay with you?
I trusted you.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
What's going on?
Cool.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
They were cut loose.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
Where'd Estes go?
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
He is exhausted.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
We will see who is the first to die.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
You are fortunate in your father.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
But they're somebody's children.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
No.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Is this the place?
Well, sure I do.
There it is, good as new.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
What boat you sailing on?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
George! George!
Well, no younger than I was.
How's that?
Got a match?
Hello.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Yes, sir.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Well, why don't you say it?
Eighteen.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Oh, Mary . . .
Mary! Mary!
How fast does this go?
Come on, you guys.
Don't!
Get on the rocks!
We're carrying weight.
Throw it.
I thought you said she was going with us?
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
What about that camera?
I'm going out there.
Because.
Pop....
It came up during the meeting.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
There is nothing to discuss.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
What makes you think there might be?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What is it?  What's the matter?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Can I go swimming?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Terry!  You okay?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Where's the rubber band?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Fine piece of engineering.
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Recovering nicely.
They said you'd be here.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Come on.
Yes, you can.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
He's a young one.
Give me a ride?
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Herpes?
Yes, it's great!
Isn't this fun!
The space shuttle has landed!
I don't talk that way.
Yes, there is goes.
Polar bears.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
I'll go with you.
How'd you do in school?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
You want to show this?
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
Like mother, like son....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
How come it's my responsibility?
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
I see what you're doing....
We don't want any....
A big one....
I want you to give up your work....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You and Sean used to make....
You hungry?
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
You the architect?
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
What happened?
Yeah....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
When I invited you...
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
Who?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
How come only me?
Shit....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
It's my fault...I have to....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Woman has taste....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Not for me ..
What does that mean?
You gotta stop smoking ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Jesus. What are you doin?
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
Have you got a print from the hand?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Is this normal?
Vehicle references.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
What are you reading?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Pray?
Sorry?
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Interview over, Blattis ...
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Oh no.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Wonder what he said.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
What --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
What about medical?
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
That's the girl I love.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
At last I find you.
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
I'll get you some quick work --
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Beautiful.
Jerry!  You made it --
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Pardon me?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
You look good.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
Where's Dad?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
You rented an automated litter box.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
We're safe!
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Well that's good.
Billy!
Any damage?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
What is?
It's... behind... us.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What?
There' no reason for name calling.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Constantly sick.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Alan?!
Come on, let's go.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
I know, it's very exciting.
Dino droppings?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Up and down, up and down!
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
It's safe.
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
Go away!
Let's go!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Well?
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
Fifty.
Chain saws.
No, but...
Mister Biller?
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Hello?
Doesnit sleep?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
What happened? Where's Jason?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Fine -- terrible.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
You work in the cemetery.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
-- You appreciate my writing.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
I'll bear that in mind.
Do you?
-- You seem amused.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
It's gone out so quickly?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
I'm sorry ...
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I can't imagine you crying.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Ann ... Ann!
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
Did you see her?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Are you gonna start it up?
What's that?
Uh uh.
Yes?
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
What was better? I made better bait?
Oh no.
-- We can talk --
Gee.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
You said it was!
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
It's kind of late.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Bree --
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Have you discussed this with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Not unusual.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Are you closing the case?
Where is the child?
What does?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
Okay...Same as usual...
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
I want a pizza.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
I don't think so.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Objection.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Sustained.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
And what is your present salary?
Objection!
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Is that...permanent?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Yes.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
What if I fight it?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
You ever think about getting married again?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Dalai Lama.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
What can I do? I am only a boy.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Did you ever doubt it?
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
It is a story, you decide.
I want to go down there.
We have enemies.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
Hmm.
No.
Much too young.
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
This is a setback.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
No way.
I got something on the screen.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
What?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Oh my God.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I didn't say it like that.
No thanks.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Thing we can lift it?
Get him onto shore.
If I'm ever in New York...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
I wouldn't.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
They don't believe her.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
What is this?
What was that?
Are you alright?
Hank?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Are you on drugs?
<u>You</u>?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Why not?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
What do you see, Starling?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Reasonably so. Yes.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Ahhh... Why?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
On what basis would they reject him?
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
What did you do?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Where were you going?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Why didn't you bury those people?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
How far is it, scout?
What?!
Fort Edward, then?
Got a reason to stay.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
They know, don't they?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Excuse me, sir...
Shut up, all of you.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
You got money in this tub?
If he had his blinkers on--
Who else...Sixpack.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Typhoon?!
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
It needs blood?
The shack...
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Yes?
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
JD.
Nope.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
They were going to pay, then?
What are you doing?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
What they like then?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
Well, what's going on?
What the hell are you doing here?
You got it all?
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That you, boy?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Look. Go on, look.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many feet?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
You jerk--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
That makes it okay?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Nice job.
What's that for?
You still going to all the home games?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Come on in--
I'm a colonel.
My mother said he never asked about--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
So I'm part-Indian?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
This place is a gold mine.
Right.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
It's a .45.
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
You get much of that in here?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Eladio Cruz.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Your mother was a saint.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
That's a matter of interpretation--
No.
Besides my father, I mean.
Morning, Hollis.
Charley Wade.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
Nobody's too busy.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
Mrs. Bledsoe?
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Nice-looking kid.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Yeah?
How come it feels the same?
So what are we gonna do about this?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
How 'bout you?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
That's Butterfield...
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Hokey enough for you?
Thanks, Billy.
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Yes.
What was that?
What the fuck?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
And this Butterfield guy--
Are you finished with me?
You believe that?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I saw him in Vegas once.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Are you sure?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
D'Amour --
You know Vinovich?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Oh yeah?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Can you do it?
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Why's that?
What is?
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
You don't think I've got it to give?
Yeah, they told me.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Yeah? But look at you.
And marriage, does that get easier?
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You are.
Where's your husband?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Mr. Harris?
Do you like massage?
Like Japanese food.
It's ok.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Hospital?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
No, what are you talking about.
Its bad for you.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Oh no...
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
I spaced out.
I'm still shaking.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
I found them in your file box.
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
Is he going to be okay?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
I don't understand what's going on.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
Peter, let go of the chair!
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What can I do?
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
Hello?
Maya?  What do you mean?
You know what?  You can go.
He can see you Thursday.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Would you sign it for me?
What's this?
Monica, what did you do?
What?
Yeah, you met her?
No I don't.
That's not it.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
Which one for tomorrow?
Okay.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
Can I take your coat?
Careful.
You could make a career by telling me where.
I don't wanna see that.
Nah.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
I told him you looked like me.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
I know.  But chances are...
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
I don't have to do what you say.
Didn't know you cared so much.
You don't look half-bad.
I can't be nice to a fan?
Forget Tonya Randall.
Clothes.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Hey.
Sorry about your game.
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
We're going to get some food.
You're what?
Just something I'm trying.
Actually, I don't...
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
You're out of your mind.
And what happens when you lose?
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
Still the man.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
So what are you gonna do?
What are you doing here?
From your mouth.
After five years.
Good.
What surery?
Your teeth are straight.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
...what the fuck is this...?
Don't sit down.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Wilson.
Yeah.
You take cream or sugar?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Yeah.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
You really use strong language.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
What happend, what's going on?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
Did you listen to me?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Picky, picky.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
How's today then?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Jack.
Hello?
I'm gonna start rolling --
She lived in Tarzana.
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
I live alone.
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
I'm sorry.
What were you saying, Stanley?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Slowly or quickly?
-- did she talk to you?
I love you.
How do we do this, then?
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
No.
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
You don't want any water?
Are you on drugs right now?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Go to it, handsome.
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
..sorry...
Hi.
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What are they doing?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Now.  You were saying?
Aramis, this will never --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
No!  Stop --
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Do I look all right?
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
D'Artagnan!
Thanks, but not for me.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Are you hungry?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Where is Michelle?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
What the hell happened?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
What did the six-toes have to say?
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
I was just having a little fun -
Something I don't already know?
Captain?
I had it all on tape...
No...I'm in some trouble...
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
What about him?
It was you who did the asking.
What have we missed?
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Who is it?
Tell me now.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Where the hell's Graham!
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
How did you come to Gateway?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
'No' what?
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
'Intimate? !"
What the hell can I do?
Molly?
Hello, hotshot!
To do what?
Blue is cold.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Thanks for the lift.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
What kind of coffee do you like?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
We were just trying to push the envelope --
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Ten.
What do you mean?
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Popcorn?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
How can you be so casual??!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
"Burlesque"?
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
Don't be ridiculous.
You don't, do you?
There's something about him, isn't there?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Give me your phone.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
This isn't real?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
And she knows what?  Everything?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
And you still believe I'm the One?
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
What's funny?
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
How did you do that?
What is this thing?
Did you go to her?
What did she tell you?
What happened?  What did you see?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
You can't!
What?
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Operator.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
They've burned through the outer shields.
No.
May God be with you.
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Panther...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
I think we should see your uncle.
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Michael, give us a lift.
What's a'matter?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Take a drink!
Hey, where you been?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
Bore.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
I'm sleepy.
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Come on.
Just keep him quiet.
Can you spare it?
Yeah.
That's your name?
Just plain 'Joe'?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I wasn't going to say --
What about the Mayor?
...This shit's not bad.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
It doesn't matter.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
I'm all excited --
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
You're overthinking it --
Well, I guess he's found one.
Obeah.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Yah.
I am.
Jennifer.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
I've got plenty of friends.
Oh goodness, no.
And I'll be a visitor.
Why?
Thank you.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
Did you like making love to me?
For how long?
But there's so much to tell you --
'Love will find out the way'?
No --
How long have I got?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Sounds fair enough.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Okay.
What way would you put it?
I'm not hungry.
'Spooning'?
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
You're what?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Then what is it?
Which is what?
Those were my words, Bill.
No.
Joe, don't do this --
Yes.
That's me.
You want me to be your guide --?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
Where are you?
About what?
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Drew's aboard?
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
I hope so.
Not my birthday again?
Don't get carried away.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
You know each other?
It'll come back, Daddy.
That was wonderful.
Then what is it?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
Are you relieved?
How'd you know?
Not at all.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
39.
30.
47.
Slam it?
That's it?
Burt.
How long have I been here?
What?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Yeah.
Why?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Dying.
A BEER, please.
You're the memory guy?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
How can you read that again?
Shut your mouth!
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Why are you here?
Natalie? Natalie who?
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Why's that?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Like what?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How do you know him?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
So who are you saying he was?					*
Why would I do that?						    *
I should kill you.							 *
What cop?
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
No.  I was in Namibia...
Sal Maguda.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
I got to talk to my ADO...
So...?
My end?
You know how improbable this is...?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
I forgot the napkins.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Is this the protective male talk?
...in the morning.
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
Then it don't work.
How much we looking for?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
Control your men.
Yeah...?
They had me from the gate.
So?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Why?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
You sure you heard what I said?
What you gonna do back there, East?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
He's got taxi fare.
For money.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
Tell her, Ratso.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Thanks, Joe.
What you got me up here for?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Twenty months?
Years?
No, I'm not afraid.
Yes.  I think so.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
What's your father do?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
What time is it?
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Lady...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
And a right.
I only got...
Wait a minute-
He's special.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Don't.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
Oh, my!
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
You want to read it?
Pretty rough so far.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
Then light the match, Paul.
Misery's Return?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Don't talk to me like that.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Did I do good?
Yes.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Nyah!
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
Would you mind if I'm on top?
I wouldn't do that.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Just like old times?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
I don't.  No exactly.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
It's the transponder.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
To friends.
What kind of show.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Is he serious?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
I'm walking.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Where were you?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
Okay...
Are you damaged?
I donít think so.
Youíre in Prague?
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
What kind?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
IMF mainframe.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Claire.
You're going to use Walter?
Abort.  Thatís an order.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
Jim, itís over.
Whatís the problem.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
The Shawfish?
Cosmo?
Rose, pass the wine.
Hi.  Hi.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
Here.
Mona?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
That's it.
Fast.
When you get engaged?
A bride without a head!
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What do you want to do now?
You're making me feel guilty again.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
This is your place.
Ronny!
Are you proposing marriage to me?
I like this ring.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Have you told her we're getting married?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
What?
Will you live here?
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Hi.
Hi, Loretta.
He should pay.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Loretta...
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Thanks, comrade.
Sorry. That was rude.
Then why are you eating alone?
Go ahead.
I'm freezing
It's Cosmo's moon.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Am I right?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Come Here.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Ni!
They're nervous, sire.
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
Look, you're a busy man ...
Oh, shut up.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Sorry ...
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
What is your name?
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
I don't want land.
Herbert.
But I don't like her.
But, Father.
Who are you?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well, look er, I ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Quick!
Well, she's got a point.
... I Bet you're gay.
Hurry!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Bravely ran away, away.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
What are you doing?!
You should have someone look after you.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Mama...
I'm sorry?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Must they always follow us?
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Mrs Brown.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Who told them that?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Hello?
I have to talk to you.
No, in person.  Now.
Can you turn off the game?
It is.
Then leave her.
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Alex...
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Okay.  It's West.
Shit...
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Go for it.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
So start at the beginning...
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Someone's shut off my money!
It's been a very strange day.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
So what's the problem?
Howdy!
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Yes...what is it?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Your Aunt called me.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
That's okay.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Okay... but just...just to see.
"Really?"
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Those men in front, in the car.
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Yeah, what for?
You feel it?
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Come on, it works.
So where does this lead ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
How long till the room fills ?
And you believe that ?
This is cute.
Do you know where you're going ?
What are you DOING here ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
It's fine thanks.
That's not to tough.
But, he's...
Stop the hydraulics.
What's wrong ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Well ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
Maybe you should get over fears.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I think we should follow him...
Are you okay ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Do you still teach?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
You want me to move?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Seriously.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
I already bought a ticket.
What does that mean?
I don't know if I want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
And she saved it.
Do you have any pictures if her?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
What's the matter?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
This is really very nice of you.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
There's water in your bathroom.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Getting off please.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Boyfriend?
Where are you going???
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Never heard of her.
Hey look!
It's not his fault!
What's that?
Lock the door.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I should do this myself.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
I think this place is just fine.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Something wrong?
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Why not now?
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
He's so tiny.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
You're such a baby.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Keep your voice down!
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
Can't you see it?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Excuse me, what about the job?
You don't like it?
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Kinda like men.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Dance with me?
This is where we are.
Kiss me.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Well, you were pretty great!
Ahem.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
No, no no....
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
This is one big house for one single person.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
No....
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Do you like her?
My Dad was funny?
She's shy.
He's allergic to everything.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Sure.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I won, I won!!!
How old are you?
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It's a mosquito bite.
Hey look at this!
No, I don't wanna.
You have no personality.
Come on, let's go.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Why are you running away?
Just do it.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
We'll never be the same.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Ben Gay.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
How about...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
So... one almost has to...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
I think he's been fired.
Well, sure.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
You're not eating.
Big weddings are so strange.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I'm up against a deadline.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
And to m...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
I hate that music.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
She's fine.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
He's going to run for president.
National television?
Okay.
President?
Come on. He's a crook.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Do you know Barbara Jean?
You want me to wait?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
What's this?
How do you know?
She had on high heels?
What kind?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
How long have you been with them?
And before?
I'm not sure. Where?
I'd really like to see you.
Hello.
Oh.
Wrong.
Stay.
I knew when I first met you.
You know who that is?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
I'm Opal.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
What do you think of him?
He is to a lot of people.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Got me an audition tonight.
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
You've heard of it?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Just wait one fucking minute.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Through the power of the simple word---
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Take a wild stab!
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Who?
Are you all set?
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Could we go with you and film it?
Yeah.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Boy - you hear me?!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Want to keep your job, boy?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Yeah.
Guess so.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Yes, aren't you?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
But I would like to see you again.
What d'you mean?
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Hi.
How did it go?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Is that so?
What's wrong?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Day work.
Don't do that!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Just get her drunk.
Like a home, for one thing.
'You Will Anderson?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Want me to hold the light for you?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Hello.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Now you stay put!
Omar--
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
We got any shots?
Can you get us into Straylight?
What the hell is that?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Where the hell have you been?
What about the route to the core?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What is it?
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
You've been calling her name.
Holy shit...
How long have I been out?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
...Feels like you.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What's that?
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Well excuse me.
Guess who I did it with last night...
Who told!
Okay. That's bad.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Hi!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Wings?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
He is totally crunching on you.
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Gus?
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Oh.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
What!?
Wow, Josie- you look really-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Boys.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Our penguin, right?
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
We followed your instructions.
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
Where are you going?
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Who told you to choke up that way?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You know her?
Are you okay.
Are you sure?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Yor dad picking the music again?
I used to live in this house.
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Max, where's Kristen?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
It's over.  It's over.
Oh God.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
Just until we get things under control.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
I've heard crazier things this week.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
What was that?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
C'mon.
I'm in.
Hi.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Are you busy tonight?
If that's all right.
Whoopsidaisies.
No, I didn't.
So who left who?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
You like Chagall?
You've got big feet.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Can I stay a bit longer?
What?
That's not true.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
I thought I'd give it to you.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Do you want to stay?
Bernie.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Yes.  What do you think?
What happened?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
Ahm... room service.
Mr. Thacker?
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
That's right -- Topol.
Any more announcements?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Right.  No one else?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Yes.
How was she?
Bad news.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
But you have no proof.
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Oh, I had them removed.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Welcome back.
Whatcha boys playin'?
What's your name, buddy?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
So long, kid.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
There they are!
What? What?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Martini!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
Okay, sucker.
Giving up?
He can't hear you!
So why are you talking to him?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
I said out!
You can come back later!
Hear what?
'Kay, place your bets.
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
A dime.
What are they?
He's a patient, Rose...
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
There they are!
What kind of crap is that???
What?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
You're sure...
What?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
No.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Do you want me to do it?
And she's a knock-out, too.
Nice dress.
So were you.
You okay?
Hi.
Yes.  I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I'll look forward to it.
Well, to-- new friends.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.
No.
What's he do?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Live happily ever after.
You okay?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
A phone message.  Only--
What's that supposed to mean?...
It was a ouija board, remember?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
They play pretty rough.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
I want to be a teacher.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I'd better go in.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
No thanks... .
And if you don't?
I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
You're not sore at me?
I don't rate it.
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
You... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I know what you want me to do!
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
My hand.
Edie.
Give me that gun.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Is Johnny in?
What's wrong with your shoulder?
My favorite little cousin.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
But they are not yet one of us.
...And what is this?
What kind of symbol?
She was?
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Oh, is this Adele?
Yes.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Why not?
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Just that she got away.
What?!
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Whatta you think?
Outside of that.
You tell your sister about it?
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
I'm going back inside.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Who was the friend?
Karen, I told you not to--
I bet.  How much?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
That's funny.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
None of your business.
That's my dad.
Think I could have them back?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
Well, does it make sense to you?
You like taking risks.
You're not dumb.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
I hear six.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Really?
I know what you're talking about.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Take the next exit.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
You like to sit down?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
He doesn't even look like that.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You wave back?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Out for the evening?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Yeah.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
It's tight.
They're all over us!
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
What's your name?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Let's go.
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Lucky lady. Hi.
And we're here on the couch...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
Where did you get that sweater?
You really love me, don't you?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Come back to me.
Yes, sir.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Terry, slow down.
Don't get your hopes up.
Ssh. He's great.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
He'll win.
Oh no!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
What happened to you?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Maddy's party.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
And the butter.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
What's up?
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
What a great kite.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Silicon is from sand.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
Hey! How was your first day at school?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
It's weird...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
I know, Mom.
Yes!
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Thanks, you guys.
Drew!
Jerk... What did you say?
What's wrong with you?
I'm ready...
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Innocuous?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I buy that.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
I'm a law suit.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Are you a good lawyer?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Thanks for coming by.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Some do. I didn't.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Hello?
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Mom?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Objection!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
How many gays do you know?
Since when?
Joe?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Not when I was in the Navy.
You taught him a lesson.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
He was doing a great job.
You came for us....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
What do you see? Riddick?
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Just come with me!
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
We just keep him locked up forever?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
Didn't bite.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Well, don't ask me to.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
How much you weigh, Johns?
Just shut up, okay?
Some prophet guy?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
The sled as a shield....
Where's Mr. Johns?
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
We crossed our own tracks.
...then we saw this.
What the hell are these?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
I'd rather piss glass.
An' this?
Take it.
The best. But we won't need them.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Now, just a minute --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
All right --
We got off at the wrong stop.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
Lucius.
One is in a museum!
ThatÕs a lie!
How so?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Of course.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Stop right there.
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
You! ... You knew about this?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Bunker...
So what's the problem?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Fuck this shit!
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
No, thanks...
Must be somebody?
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Merle?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
The brush-off, huh?
Okay. You win.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
You're drinking it.
I didn't say anything.
Want a spike in it?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
Cold?
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Mine?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Would I want to?
Yes, Miss.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Where's you get it?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
Private eye?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
And without much discrimination.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
The usual grind.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You'd be breaking the law.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Right.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
He checks too.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
I have a rough idea.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
I told you she's just..
Right.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
It's terribly good.
Attributed?
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
I thought it was tremendous.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Me too.
Jeremy phoned this morning
Bastard.
Now, top secret file.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
That's enough of that.
The torture of small children--
What period?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It was last year.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
You gonna pull?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
What's this?
I'm not armed.
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
How was the beach?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Sorry.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Johnny, it's the only way.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
... so I started tailing him.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Who's the girl?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Mean anything to you?
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
What in God's name...?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Who are you going after next, sir?
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What's your name, lover.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Did you sleep well?
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Not... quite.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
The Rex.
Hello?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fuck off.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Business.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Edward, did you hear me?
What!?
Why do you want to know?
Did I wake you?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
What!?
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Couple a hours.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
May I help you?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Every ship but the four you sent.
I killed him myself.
I fear I'll never see you again.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
We'll never survive.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
You've been mostly dead all day.
Inigo.
What?
Yes.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Where's Fezzik?
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Slow going?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me explain-
You're that smart?
You're just stalling now.
-- get back, witch --
Yeah, an hour.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
But sir, I'm not condem ...
What is that?  A handkerchief?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
Where would you like to eat?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
What are you doing?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
I solemnly swear...
Hindenburg...
Heil you know who!
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
No. At least I don't recall.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Very early. Dawn.
No! Of all...
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Let's all talk about Mary.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
What should I know?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I ought to call the police right now!
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What?
What is it?
How can you even think a thing like that!
Am I that close to Fairvale?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're very... kind.
Is your time so empty?
Why do you ask that?
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
Phoenix?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Wait a minute!
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Barefaced.
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
You didn't find anything.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Did you wish to see someone?
Gosh, you had me fooled.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
How do you do.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's down there?
What is it now?
You're losing your blood?
That spoke to you?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
Yes, why?
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
But what about lunch?
Why didn't you eat last night?
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I think so.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
That's the way I feel about it.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Meaning what?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
That's the one.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
That's what I said.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Oh, is that what caused it?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
What was her name?
A place you've never been.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
There goes Mother.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
So am I.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Well, she's back.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
You're so sweet.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Took your time gettin' here.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
What's the plan?
When you planning to cut back on that?
Why do I always have to sit in back?
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Can't be worse than you.
Let's get this thing done.
You get him?
Do tell.
The gang's all here!
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Han!
Shall we try and go around?
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
All wings report in.
Good shot, Red Two.
Over there! Two more of them!
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Yes or no will do.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
You!
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
You promise you won't tell?
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Yes.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You're OK by me.
What a guy
Are you - giving a party?
Who's Eddie?
...How's the turtle food this week?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Like?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
...I dunno.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
No doctor!
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
I don't like ya face.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Seven minutes!
Six!
Here -- Three minutes.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
What?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
...What?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
The legs must be goin'.
...Did ya fight last night?
...What?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Ya nose is broke.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
Yo, Paulie.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Why?
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
...I can't haul meat no more.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Do you feel you have a chance?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Is this paper even good?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
What was <u>that</u>?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
You shot Roger.
How did you get onto Doom?
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
What the hell is that?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
What the hell are you doin'?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
How do you know that?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Farewell, my cuz.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
'Tis he.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
By the hour of nine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
A most courteous exposition.
I will follow you.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Nurse.
Why did you do that?
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
Well I don't!
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
What is?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Lose them!
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
I still am.
It's quite satifactory.
That fucking figures...
He's company.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Then where is it?
Yeah.
So this is what, a test?
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
How did you know?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
He's going back.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
You speak French.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What happened to it?
Gaelic.
Doing well.  This is?
Can you get it?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
I don't know...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You're crazy.
Here it is.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
We've got to go now, then.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
And you're solid on that?
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Don't you have to be here?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Anything I can help you with?
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Whatever...
Dwayne please calm down!
I'm not asking.
How's work?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Winner!  Four, winner!
Wait.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
So tell me what you know.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Yeah, that's right.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
Hello.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Not Yu.  You!
You're not very good at this, are you?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
He'll be back soon.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Is it hot in here?
Wait!  There's people down there!
Well we're not friends.
Yes.  We have heaven.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Steamed dumplings?
Are you serious?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Very nice.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
What is this?
First class.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Master Ching taught me.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
What is your name?
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You have one of these?
Where were we?
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Shortcut?
You make the plate?
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You talk too fast.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Not anymore.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
How'd what go?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
You sonuvabitch.
He is very good.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
You don't understand this guy.
I'm not running.
See you at the wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Or a vegetarian?
Okay, we'll order out.
Of course we are.  Of course.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
They made me put my hat back on.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
How romantic.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
I think so.
Always a mood killer.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
I'm a work in progress.
No.
I already explained about that.
About a minute...?
I love you.  I love you.
And the church.
I'm okay with that.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Does it matter?
Reporter?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
You take the microwave?
Even when you were young?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
I told you.  Nothing --
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
You're a basket case.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Can too.
Men never get this movie.
What?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What about the letter?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
All righ...
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
It's Y. O. H.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Not.
What?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
It was sinking.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Did you call that radio station again?
Have you seen my wallet?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Do you like baseball?
What about camping?
Do you like it?
You're kidding --
Oh.
He's ten.
Got any more ideas?
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Who? A scab?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
Where you going?
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Tell me.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
No. New York.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
What?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
I can't leave.
Why don't you call the cops?
Oh. Hi.
How far out of town?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
We been through that.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Colette, go.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
What?
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Danny?
What's this?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
You don't understand.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
You're serious?
Now get talkin'
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
I've got a hot one.
No last name?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
What're your taking down?
You've got no choice.
Murder.  Beautiful.
I thought you'd be happy.
The Mexicali Boys
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You think that's a good idea?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
A private, sir?
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Jackson?
No kiddin'?
Where?
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
What is it?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
GO!
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
How about...?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
I'm listening, sir.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Shit, sir.
Damn fool.  Sir.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
How fast?
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Lloyd?
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Gee, it's easy.
No, no, don't go in there.
That's unlikely.
That's not even a scam.
I don't feel anything.
Lloyd is doomed.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I'll put this past my boss
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Ha!
What are you doing?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
What?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
I swear to god.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
You will?
Well...
So we can finally talk?
He does this every year?
Thank-you.
Have a good sleep.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Sure I do.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Stop by later.
Yes.
Yeah.  With potential.
Okay, this is important...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Yeah.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
One more time would be nice.
Okay.
Okay.
It's your castle, man.
You're freaking out here man.
YEAH!
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
Just her name.
I was gonna...
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
What?
Should I stay?
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Scherner told me something else about you.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
You're not telling me something.
You asked for shoe polish.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
What are you doing?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
What?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Eight hundred, give or take.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
Can't we hold him?
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
He's broken his pattern.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
I did that.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Where's Sid?
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Who are you?
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
It's good to see you involved.
I have rehearsal.
I got a surprise for you.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
What are you talking about?
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
What kind of a game?
Can I help you?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
What do you mean?
What?
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Who's phone?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Nobody said she was an actor.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Gale he's got Dewey!
I know!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Hello.
It's Sarah.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
How'd you do?
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
What are you doing here?
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
You know that's not true.
So...
I wanna let go. I do...
NO! Don't believe him.
What?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Yes?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I wanna play a game.
Michael... Michael Myers.
You tricked me...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
What brings you out to these parts?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I like it. It's... sexy.
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
At the airport.
You girls ready.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Where is she?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Are you alone in the house?
Hello?
Have a good trip.
Don't come any closer.
You coming tonight?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
You're crazy -- both of you.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Do you believe this shit?
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
You've left unfinished business before.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
How you feeling?
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
What time is it?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
This doesn't make any sense.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He's preaching.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
No witnesses of any kind?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
How did the fire fight end?
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
So they ran our list.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
No.
Tell me it's not true.
Anything... anything missing or different.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
You ain't goin'...
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
Got a warrant?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
I didn't give any order to fire!
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
I say NO!
What in...?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
How'd you come by this?
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
What you want me to call you?
You want us to fire a shot if...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Think she means for us to follow?
No...She's not...
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
I miss Tommi so much.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Well, look here!
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Oh…what have I done?
Thank you, my lady!
Wait!  Will you desist!
Most interesting.
How long has it been?
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
But nothing is happening.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
It is over.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Cut round him for now.
Romeo.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Be good to her, my lord!
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Who are you, master?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Can you love a fool?
Oh, do not go
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
She sings too?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
He made it clear.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
Finished.
Doesn't it worry you?
Nothing.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
That's right.
And you like it?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Hugo.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
No, Alex. It's, it's --
I don't want to. It's different.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Hello. Hello.
No.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
You know we're right.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Aren't you going to answer it?
It's about me and David.
So, uh...
I see.
Is this where no one stays?
Yes.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you know many of these people?
I'm sorry.
In this firm.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Here?.
You must be Hugo.
Writing seems easy.
It was some guy called Brian.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Your watch.
Chicken salad.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Do you think George is a fairy?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- is that right?
Thanks a lot.
She's got a...
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
What're you doing later?
Your husband?
I know.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
You here to see my mother?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I asked you first.
What?
How is she?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
How long you had this?
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
Where do you want to do this?
You would?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
... I don't get it done often.
No.
And?
It'll ruin everything.
Sit down.
Don't do it.
-- don't you want to --
-- you are.
I don't know what gets into me.
Why?
So I'm saying it...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
Oh yeah?
I'm busy, man.
Yeah!
Here in the canyon.
How are you, baby?
Honey?
Yeah.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Jill says nothing.
Now, Jackie --
How come you took your own car?
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Yes.
-- please, baby --
I wish you'd go now.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
George...
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Tonight?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Sit down.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I wanna hear it from you!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
You really think so?

Awww --
No you won't.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
You and your touchy investors.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Shut the door, shut the door!
Fine.
Five times a day?
It's been so long I don't how long?
C'mon.
-- Yesss?
Why don't you ask for another one?
Johnny!
Good for you.
George? Was he alone?
That bastard.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
You're kidding.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- there's not much room --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Are you married?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
I don't know.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
No I ain't.
Yeah.
Mommy!
Oh,
Shall we go into the living room?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Sure.
Who?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
What'll it be?
It's good to see you.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
I...
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Give me the bat.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Well, obviously some people can be
This is our Colorado Lounge.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
I've been hearing noises in there.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Was it a prescription?
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
It could have been anything, Marty.
Yeah? Really?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
How are you doing.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
What? 
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
This prom is a real drag.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Hurry, Sister!
Soprano or alto?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
It'll be hell.
Van Cartier.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
Three years.  A rookie.
You have to help me
We need experience.
Who are all these people?
Oh my Lord!
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
Are you leaving us?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Miss Van Cartier.
The vow of obedience.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
It never solves anything.
In English?
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
A vote?
But -- why?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
You're not... seeing anybody?
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
But you didn't tell me!
I can't see anything in here!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
She's gettin' away!
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
He's not like other guys.
Not a note.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
I lied.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
He is a behemoth.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
The Widow Windsor.
What is that you wear?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Climb up!
How are you?
Other people?
My suitor?
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Thank you.  No.  Here...
Why would you do such a thing?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
My God... what has happened?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Go home.
I don't reckon.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
I'll see you, Bill.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
You know what, by God?
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
What's in your bag?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Don't you live somewhere?
They let you out?
They still around, your folks?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
So it died when it come out?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Yeah, I guess.
Yes sir.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
What!
And what are you, his chaperone?
Like me, too.
Will that be cash or charge?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
How'd you get started?
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
Hey, man, good to see you.
No, he's not. You are.
Two, right?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
She probably died.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Does it hurt?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
You going to sit here all day?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Well, if you put it that way...
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Yeah, that's right.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Hey, it's you.
Where did you get that thing?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
Fries?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Did you say more?
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Well, why does it?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Cigarette?
You always run with the well open?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
White or black?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
Does it now?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
Are you absol...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
You're right, Joe.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Yeah - where were you?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
You'd better go fix it.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
With ME?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
OH!
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Good night, Sugar.
Oh - Sugar!
And you've got cold feet.
What do you think you're doing?
We don't have to run.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
No!
Thirty-four.
I was it.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
About that roadhouse -
You're leading again.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Why not?
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Oh?
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Running away?  From what?
Rough?
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Thank you.
I'm not interested at all.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Oh - in here.
What is it?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
PLEASE!
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Refresh my memory.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
You know what I love about all this?
Christ, Amy.
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Huh?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
That was a long time ago.
Brilliant.
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Six thousand, right?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
You quitting?
Who are they?
What?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
How did you know that was me?
There’s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
Are you sure?
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Yeah. You?
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
You want me to let him in?
“Not yet...”
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
And so you did your job, right?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Can you swim?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
What's wrong with him, David?
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Whatcha got there?
Night, son!
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
What?
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Goodnight, honey.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
What?
Look at that!
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Yes I am!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
Who is it?
Guess.
Oh my God...
Dude, we don't have watches.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Nowhere.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
What about air strikes?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Fight the power!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh yeah...
Evening.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Idiot...
It's time we lock coordinates.
Look at this...Jesus.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Really?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
Explosive?
Dawn!  Dawn!
Take this flare.
But how are you going to escape?
Will you marry me?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
What is it?!
I'm homesick.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
It's a beautiful thing.
Buzz Fazeli.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Theo.
What the fuck is this?
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
He's the guy Buzz.
How's that?
Knock-knock.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
Leave him alone!
132, 154.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
Why were you suspended?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Very good, busyboy.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
How big is this spacecraft?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Anything else?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
But sir --
You don't think weapons are important?
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
So?  What's the problem?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Edmunds?
What is that?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
What do you mean -- not normal?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
In Edmunds' things.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
What's the matter?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
None of this was here before.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Parasolutrine?
Not believing you.
But --
You're insane.
I promise --
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
You hear that?
Would it work?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
For who?  The fish?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Norman, where are you?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
She's cracking, Norman.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Missed.
How's that working out, by the way?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
English?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Good idea, Ted.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Norman Johnson.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
He wasn't feeling well.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Well, we'll see...
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
I'll get the information.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Here come six more... grid two!
There are only three or four left.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
No!...
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Are you safe?
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I don't believe it !
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Well, whad'ya know...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
So ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
He's nothing like you.
Are you the boy for me ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Do you mean it ?
Shhhh...!
You don't look very happy to see me.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
It stinks, you goin.
Well, see ya.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Mr. Rasczak.
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Mister Rasczak ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Disclose the information.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Captain, what's the next move?
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
They had a pattern to follow...
What answers?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Not for us?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
I have one, but they lost it.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You like kids?
Great.  Who is it...?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
No, that's true.
Good morning.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...and we could get up every morning...
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
What are you going to do?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
Ten thousand dollars.
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
I'm sorry.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Big day last night.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...why am I here...?
I will.
They think it's your First Wife...
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You have to hide.
That's my...
We're just talking about the...
I know that...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
What?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Why not?
Doug...
Arrest him.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
He saw the accident...?
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
Town's out of lilacs.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
I know the feeling.
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
How do they know that, you told them?
What is that...?
It's lovely.
You cool the broad out?
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
She wasn't in...you were al...
Yeah?
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Where are we?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
It just slipped out.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
That happens.  To families.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
This'll work, huh?
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
I don't want to say goodbye.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
No.  I think it's ugly.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
Uh.  What is it?
In high school.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
No they're not.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
Excuse me --
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
IS THAT YOU?
Queen of diamonds.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
It's not good enough.
And when did that pass?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Which part of no don't you understand?
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Are you here?
Something's up wi...
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
It's temporary.
What happens next?
Get out!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
...in.
I have a snoop.
Look, you've never liked me...
You bet you are.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Oh, my God.
She's devastated.
Can I look at the pictures?
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
You're lying.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Look.  I know they hate me.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's forever you know.
They're my kids.
No problem.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Must've been hard being poor.
But really, you never know.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Mom?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
What do you want?
OK.
Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hello, Vi.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
That's good.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Fuck me hard!
I dunno...
Who is this?
But...you called.
I believe it.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
That's good.
How many?
How'd you get it?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Scooby?
You want some?
Doubt it.
So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
What is most important to you?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What now?
--be prepared.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Now what?
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
Enjoying the tour so far?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
My seven body orifices????
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
That is correct, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Right.
Do you think they would cheat?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Yes, Major.
What happened?
He's dead, all right.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
That's the point.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
I'm okay.  What's up?
Have you tried the emergency system?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
Sure, King.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
That was really great.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
A cloud.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
I know, man.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Oh, you were in the band?
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
It's okay.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
You could do it.
You okay, man? You okay?
Will you stand up for me?
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
You rich?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Erica, you coming?
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Yes.
No.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Nazeer what?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Can I talk?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It got that close.
Jeff. Jeff.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-hm.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Wait, away?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Do your covers and all that shit.
You really suck, you know that?
Really?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Ready?
No, this has everything to do with you.
Pony, oh my god!
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah, come on, play it.
Soon.
Is that Jeff?
You know, my mom has this saying.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
What are you going to do? Hm?
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Di, we're sorry.  We...
... I don't know.  Probably not.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Madonna.
Hat-trick?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Hello?
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
You want us to help you pick up?
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
If I could be of any help...
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Good.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Why not?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
Or shall I call my servant?
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
You're a writer, you said.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
What scene?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
They've come for my car.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
The other guests?
What are the notes?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
How did it go?
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
What's the matter, Max?
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Bring something to drink.
Paramount is calling.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
She said it wouldn't last.
And now?
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
Oh no, not you again.
They think I have a concussion.
I know it.
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Hey, where you going?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I'd rather not talk about it.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You're wasting your breath.
Shouldnt've done that.
Others?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
That horrible woman!
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
You're going to take me back?
What are you talkin' about?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
Me??
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
I can never get a way from it.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Well, aren't you excited?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
What kind?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Columbia.
Wipe 'em out?
Hey, boss.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
Now...when do I get a taste?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Who is she?
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
What terrific story?
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Where's the light switch?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
53.
Okay? Goodbye.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
It could make weather!
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Yes! This time we got it right!
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
I was right. you are Superman.
Hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Lois, someday --
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
It has everything.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Where?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
You must be freezing.
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
What's he going to say?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Stop him, Clark!
What now, my love?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
What'd you call him?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Again???
Damn!  This will get him.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Ready?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
I don't understand.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
No! You couldn't imagine -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
With my luck, now it'll rain.
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
I gave him this new face.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
Yes...fine.
Say hi to Zoe.
I understand.
Case?
I have to.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
Because I'd be to blame, right?
That's what he said, is it?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
We've only got honey.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Nicole!
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Dolores.
Why?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Need a hand?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
DADDY!!!
That's not news, Zoe.
I tested positive.
What for?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
No.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
There wasn't time?
You remember this?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
What do you mean?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Back?
Yeah!
What would you think of me if -
But...
Who else phoned?
What's the matter?
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
I didn't do anything!
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Torque wrench please.
You will.
Why do you cry?
Alriight!!  My man!
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Easy money!
We're better off by ourselves.
I love you.  I always will.
Kyle, don't go!
You broke my arm!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And no elbows on the table!
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
What's that mean?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Major, Major... he's here ...
How come?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough, tough!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
What's he like?
My whole life has been combat.
A girl.  You know.
I bet you're ticklish.
And who was the enemy?
Here, drink some of this...
Give me the short version.
What?
I could fight you on this.
I'm so sorry.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
Do you know what to do?
You've got to be kidding.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Home.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'll give you a boost.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
This is C.R.S.
A fresh shirt...
What are you doing here?
Want anything to drink?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Then, what good are you?
Get us out of here...
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Nicholas...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Julliard, yeah.
Happy Birthday, man.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
For you.
Call that number.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
It doesn't matter...
Do you know how to change a tire?
How did those... ?
Split it?
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Where?
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
I've been so lonely.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Didn't I give you two?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
What makes you ask?
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
What's happened...
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
Luke, can I talk to you?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Well, this lot is full!
Are you working with her?
You don't believe in the paranormal.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Theo... Did you?
Why?
That's so sad.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What kind?
You broke last time.
CQ what?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Who done it, then?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
What more is there.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Has he?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Had a feeling it was you.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Weren't you on a television series?
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
You don't seem bothered.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
I guess you're just habitual.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
So what's your beef, pal?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Of the deal, man.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
You sure?
Yeah, that's right.
Been away a lot.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
I don't get it.
Hello there.
What kind of trouble are you in?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
What.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
But more or less.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
...I guess I've been all wet.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
How much to they want, Dave?
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Should I... should I tell you why?
How did you get into the store?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
...Ed?
Jesus...
You don't got a headache?
Hello!
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
He's a barber.
Second chair.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Sweet Jesus!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
Yes.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
The body?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
It's still back there!
What's that?
What does it say?
What are we talking about here?
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
They're all heavily armed.
You're not.  Where is it?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
Hide quickly!
Help someone!
You want to book the flight?
We're not watching the sea.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
Who are you?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
The memory of who?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
Marlon--
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Well, what do you think?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Well, thank you for your help.
Good.  Good.
Poopy day?
You've got something to show me.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
I'm looking for him.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Who sent you?
And what's that?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You found something?
What?
What do you think?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Had you.
Scully?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
What are you implying, Scully?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
What kind of infection?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
What?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
We've got to keep moving.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Are we being watched?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
My god...
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
Sing a song of sixpence.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
...give a kiss to Edward.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
What then?
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
What about Julia?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Wait...
That went well.
He's mine?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
You're looking well.
How is she?
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
We proceed assuming she is.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
What's she talking about?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Who are you looking for now?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Holly.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Have you seen Calloway?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
That's what we want to find out.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Can you tell me whose...
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Him dying like that.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Well?
Didn't I?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Seems exciting.
Striptease, sir.
Hmm.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
...this way.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Baron Kurtz.
Oh, you did.
That's all you meant?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Where are you staying?
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
I don't know - I'm American.
Richard - I saw a fin!
But he has been there, off course.
Have you told someone?
You think?! Based on what?
What's a fascist?
Fucking Danny, man...
What do you think you're doing?
You coming?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
When can I see you?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
It looks a little like a swastika.
And belief follows?
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Who? How would I know him?
Give me a reason not to.
Explain it so I can.
I thought you hated Torah.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
What about chicken?
Hello...?
Isn't it true?
Who knows what that is?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Which one were you aiming at?
What is it?
Not too fast.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
How?
You missed on purpose.
Who's this?
Do you think I...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Oh, fuck you...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
What do you mean?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
Good afternoon.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
Is he alright?  What happened?
How did it happen?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Yes?
Enzo, wake up!
It isn't lit yet.
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
I don't have one.
Well, what are they?
That's good.
Your mother?
Madame...
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
... Everything.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Good night.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
I recognize you.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
You'll try again tomorrow?
You want to lie down for a while?
Why?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
What are they for?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Will he understand Spanish?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
So why the long face?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
Want to get a drink?
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
We do!
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
You okay?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Is he in love with you?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Don't look at it!
Love is different for different people.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
It's about the leopard.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
I can use them.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Mr Lombard...
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Something like that?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
So, what are you looking for?
Ever seen him before?
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Oh... We split up.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Is this Friedman?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Why did you kill him?
Try again, and this time be polite.
When they realise I’m missing...
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Are they still operative?
What do you think?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
It's a miracle she's not dead!
I'll go.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
And?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
How old are you?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Get them out of here!
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Good.  Where are the English?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
This is no good!
And... what does Jeanne think?
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
Besides, what about these...?
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
What are you doing out here?
Why would they?
God asked you to do something?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
But you already confessed this morning...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Him?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
A beauty. Who is she?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Sit.
When's your baby due?
Will I still be able to play?
Let me see this.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
And suppose they take the table away?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
That's better than yesterday.
It's not funny.
I can look after myself!
Why didn't you come to me?
Pig!
Dirty pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
Where are you hiding?
What's all that gunfire?
Are the Russians here?
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
She wants to see what you can do.
What?
He's given it to us.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
I'm out, Johnny.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
You just worry about your end, kid.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
I'm not sure I know it.
How ya doin'?
I guess I left it in my room.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
You got a back door to this place?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
Well, what did I tell ya?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
You got nothin' on me.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What's your next step, Nick?
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
What?
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
You hand that over to the police.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Aren't you Nick Charles?
I don't know.
Dead?
It's been the same one for three months.
How's your brother?
You can take that out to the car.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Did you kill her?
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Who's that man?
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
But what if you need more money?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
I have no right to answer that.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
Isn't that my drink?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
What do you mean?
I'm going to tell her.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
You worked here?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
A casual one.
What?
What are you doing.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
You ready?
You're the one with all the ideas.
Get off him.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It's a combat action.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
What!?  What!?
You think?
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Take the binoculars.
They'll shoot us!
It'd make their heads explode.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
Where you going?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
You're going to be fine.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Wes might be right about that.
How!?
No.
First Wes, now you?
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Oh, God...
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
Some good ones.
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
You get it yet?
You will.  You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
If there's gold.  If!
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
I think he wants something to drink.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Stress category.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
HUMMMM.....
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
I have to... he's a G-34
I've never been under the table before.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
Are you all right?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
Why did you have LUH come here?
Where's LUH?
I'll report you.  It's....
What?
Which way?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Remember this...?
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Alright, let's check it out.
What was-? Why...?
Treat. We treat devices.
This is where the van was parked.
How long are we going to stay?
Why do you do it?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Ex-girlfriend?
What's up?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
Political.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Computer device?
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Why are we stopping here?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
What the hell's going on?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Vice... Jesus.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
What was it this time?
You okay?
Device.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
I'll do it.
It's our only option.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Like it?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Who?
The tennis player?
I like you, Baron.
Monescu!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Do you know my first name?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
The same thing.
Then a little nap--
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Any minute I want!
But attractive--
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Yes, Gaston?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
You look beautiful.
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Yes, madame?
Then why did you do it?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
What?
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
I make my own luck.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
You're distracting me. Go away.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
So don't marry him.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Where to, Miss?
This is horseshit.
You jump, I jump, right?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
I'm sorry.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
I hope so.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Like her paint job?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
This is Mr.--er--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Nix, the law!
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Inspector McKinney.
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I'll go with you.
Hello, young fellow!
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Oh, there you are--
McKinney's the name.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
--And he has sex appeal.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
That's him! That's the sucker!!
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
No!
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
Ain't got time.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
God damn son of a...
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Listen, I want to talk to you.
I'm retired.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Age quod agis.
What's wrong, Doc?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.

Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?

Always?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
I have to go.
Wyatt!  My God...
What can I get you?
Oh, all right.
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Yeah?
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Get down, boy.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Look pretty rough.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
What about all these saloons?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
It's too late -
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
His newspapers?
That's reassuring.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Interesting presentation.
No.
Have we met?
If I were you -
This has got to be a mistake.
Down?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
What is HE doing here?
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Please sir. Please -
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Why does he always pick on me?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I'm busy.
How is the garden doing?
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
What's the problem here?
How many people do you all feed?
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
When did you talk to Harry?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Yeah?!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Which one can I open first?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Are you peeking?
I dunno.
No she's NOT --
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Laser-envy.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Reach for the sky!!
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
I want to go home.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Finn ...
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
I already lost everything once.
I'm Melanie.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Why does he need money?
What is he planning on telling them?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Don't bother.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Is this bad for him?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
Private?
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
Yes.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
I got money.
She's not at that place you sent her?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
OK. Same again?
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
What's your name?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Happy birthday.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
What's on the menu this evening?
Excellent.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
How's it going with Gail?
How long is it?
Where did she come up with that?
What do you see as your main strengths?
With a starship!
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Sulu, what are you doing?
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
No, but you can bet they will.
Where did you get this power?
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Spock.
What is this?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Your vision?

And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
Each man's pain is unique.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
They'll start to soon enough.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
That all you can say?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
Then...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
How did you do that, Flynn?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Thank. you, Master Control.
You think we can make it there?
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
What did he give you?
No.  But I wanted to.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
Beat it.
What's going on, Harry?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Not yet.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
I don't remember.
Turn-offs?
What's that?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
She OD'd, didn't she?
You have a pimp?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Where you goin', honey?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
I think what you did was...
With a vengeance, I hated them.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Why Cancoon?
I'm hip.
Live with what?
You'd really do that?
Who the fuck are you?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
This is Drexl's coke?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot what?
The zoo.
Clarence...
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
He wants to talk ya.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Could we try it now?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
He knows.
He saw the wire.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Preach on, Big D.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Put it in your pants.
No.
Well?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
That's him.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You used to call me "James".
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
What does this mean to you?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
What...virus?
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Nothing.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
It's nonsense.
You want somethin'?
You own this place?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who was that on the phone?
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
I got it.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Where you coming from?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
I didn't say it bothered me.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I'm guessing no.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Have you ever been there before?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Jake.
Shit!
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
John!
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
Someone will find me.
Who the hell are you?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I have half a mind to--
What happened to your hand?
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Where you headed?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
Not from where I stand.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Now, what's this?
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Kids.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
What?
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Would you?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
Shhh! Liar.
Got any requests?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Hey.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Soda.  You got any soda?
I got it.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Where you coming from?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens when you lose?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You'd never understand.
Where?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I wanted to talk.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
Grace ... Grace?
I can't see it.
I'm not sailing his boat.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
What'd you say to me!
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Let me get your change.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
I axed you a question.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Proceed.
Is that the entire message?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
...I can't remember.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Would you like to try going--
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
I assumed because of the train.
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
Just give me a minute.
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Are you finished?
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
I'm going to go in.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'm going to work out.
I know now.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Not really.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Was your family traveling with you?
Is this a religious thing?
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Rain's coming.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He give 'em names?
I thought... you was an angel.
What's all that wood?
Like I said, I...
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Duke.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
Finish him, Ned.
Did you kill him?
Better re-load it.
He ain't killed.
They takin' water?
That was... the first one.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
I trust you, Bill.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Three ways?
He musta been movin' right along.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
He's gonna die, ain't he?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
They just said they wanted time.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
We'll make it.
What-are they speaking?
Ready?
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
We're on vacation.
A little of both.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
What do you mean I can't see him?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
You're not safe on your own.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
He was accused of jury tampering.
... tell me about this case.
What are you doing here?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I do.  Yes.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
What is this going to cost?
I am seventy-four years old.
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
) I'm sorry ...?
Thank you ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You know what happened.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I object, your Honor...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Maybe I can do something right.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is it over?
Dr. Gruber.
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
...yeah...good...
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I know.  I went ...
... I understand ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I just saw her.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Who told you that?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
One hour.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Nothing.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
It's a place to live, that's all.
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
No? Then what?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
The color of your hair...
Well?
That's what I had in mind.
Scottie!
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, please...!
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
You don't remember.
When?
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Would you like some coffee?
No.
What are you thinking?
Where were you born?
What else?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
No, don't go away!
Yes --
Where?
Oh, yes!
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Well?... what'll you do?
How's your love life, Midge?
Could be.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
I've told you enough.
Just wander.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
What's that?
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Name one.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
So that's what we're doing.
What is your problem?
Who? What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
He just had two.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
What kind of words?
You're a fucking moron.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Then what do they have?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
There's my point exactly.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Easy Micheal.
Why?
He is.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
I just don't see him in the big picture.
Keith do not trivialize this.
Not padded ones.
Yeah. Nesting.
Hello.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Everything okay?
It means she's insecure.
I'm getting married...
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
I guess.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Stop this, stop this.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Let me pass!
What will the lady say?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
What's the matter with you?
How in hell does it wind up?
You see how much you like her?
Me, rich? Come on!
Kill him.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Don't say that.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
What's going on, Moncho?
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Have I slept long?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
You know how much man power you're talking about?
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
I haven't been working on anything.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
My God...
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You all right?
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
She's beautiful, you know?
Don't worry about it, all right?
What did you do to those people?
You know I am.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Find out anything?
More or less.
Where's John?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
What are you saying...
...on the way in.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
Mr. President, this is St...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
It won't hold.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
Yes
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Why is this putz on the air...
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
No rain.
Pride of a job-well-done...
What about him?
Oh, MiGod.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Whaddaya think?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Why do they go to War?
Do I know you?
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
"Back End" ... count on it.
In the Folk Music Section.
Where is he now?
...we get our hands on him?
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
No, I didn't think so.
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Hell of a show.  Hell of a job, Stan.
Show Must Go On.
What're you doing?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
I go with this here... 
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
Black...
Public Domain.
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Yup.
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Grand Marnier.
... That's what you told us to say.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
Speak English will ya.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Whatever night you like.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your words, not mine...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
You sure?
So, where are we going?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, right...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
I guess I'll head back...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
What if I have a previous engagement?
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I don't.
...isn't it perfect!
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Weird and tiny huh?
Would you like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right
We're all here, and ready sir!
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Yes?
Of course you will.
I miss you.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What?
You think that'll help?
No.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Oh-kay...
I've seen you.  From the window.
Tell me.  Please.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
What was her major?
You're discussing me with your psychic?
You think he killed her?
Nothing's happening.
What?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
I can't believe this is happening.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Maybe we should just...
Oh.
I think so.  Maybe.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Did you tell her?
Dressed?
When?
There we go.
Norman...
Are you lonely?
What?
What are you...?  No.
Keep your voice down.
Do I have everything?
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
It's Madison Fra--
I think she's starting to suspect something.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
What?
:Would you stop it!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
With his hands!
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Who the hel1 -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
If that were true, I would not be here.
I know that you're evil.
I do not understand...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
HARDER!
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Too much... too fast...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
You know...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Do you love me, Michael...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Hi.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
And it can't be forged?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Do you take sugar?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
And how did it feel to be rid of him
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
What happened?
ANGEL...
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Check this out.  Hurry!
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
You do know how to drive?
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
And then what?
You're amazing.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Do you trust me, Julie?
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
You promise you'll finish school?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
But who would run the store?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You called the cops on us?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
Merritt, Forensics.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
How long?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
We all have...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Will you do me one favor?
About a year ago.
No.
He did say something.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
The teeth, were they...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
I say something funny?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
You are.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
But I..
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Well... that, too.
You might have mentioned you had that.
And people are actually fooled by that?
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
There's only seventy-eight.
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Good work.  Really.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
I've even printed my own currency.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Hey...!
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Why did you say that?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
What's that?  I hear something!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
You?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
But what am I gonna transform??
What'd you bit me for!!
I just wanted to test it first.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Talk!  Say something!
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Are they going to kill you?
Amish.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
What's your first move?
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
When will you be going?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
God, Fred...
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I will be the judge of that.
No, you listen. Get out!
Is this where we're going?
To see?
If she?
...resourceful!
Oh --
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Run, Toto, run!
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Are you ready now?
That's right.  What's she doing?
Oh --
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oh --
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
...has been simply unbearable.
A home --
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
I'll be home in time for supper!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Because I'm still scared!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Yes -- there --
Oh -- Oh --
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
Stop pushing!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
...junk!
...of the West.
Come on -- come on --
It's a whozis.
...to Dorothy!
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
Nuclear.
Do you know what you’re doing?
Construction’s not exactly my line.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
Consider me ungrateful.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I can’t stay.
How did you survive?
I don’t know what you’re talking about!
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
What?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
The bearer of bad news.
Blake?  Dead?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
What was he doing?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
So do I.  So do you.
What new information?
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What caused it?
I can fix it.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I'm terribly sorry.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
New information.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Thanks.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
