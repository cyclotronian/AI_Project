that doesn &apos;t apply to me because i &apos;m not a criminal .   i &apos;m not a criminal !   i wasn &apos;t convicted . 
but doesn &apos;t the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ? 
we &apos;re in negotiations ,  that &apos;s correct . 
and isn &apos;t there a movie in the works about you ? 
look ,  i &apos;m in here .   you call this a career move ? 
permanently disrupted ?   aren &apos;t you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ?   hasn &apos;t this  &apos;incident &apos; as you call it ,  jump started your career as an artist ? 
look ,  i &apos;m a victim here ,  too .   i was a year away from getting my masters in art ,  now i &apos;ll never graduate .   my life has been permanently disrupted . 
you seem very savvy for a man who &apos;s been found mentally incompetent to stand trial . 
it was my finger that pulled the trigger ,  but i &apos;m not morally responsible .   my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of .   how could i know .  i &apos;m not a doctor . 
 .  .  . so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ? 
yes .   my psychiatrist didn &apos;t insist that i stay on my medication . 
your doctor ? 
this had nothing to do with shoes that didn &apos;t fit or my relationship with my father who ,  as you know ,  made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties .  these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor . 
we &apos;re trying to get there .  i hope we can . 
continued
i &apos;m sorry ,  dr .  smyslov ,  but i &apos;m really not at liberty to discuss this . 
continued
how did they manage to do that without any communication ? 
continued
well ,  i suppose they &apos;ve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment . 
continued
she &apos;s wonderful . 
continued
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve only got a few minutes ,  but i &apos;d love to . 
continued
well ,  how nice to see you again ,  elena .  you &apos;re looking wonderful . 
space stattion 5  -  lounge
roger . 
i think i &apos;ll have to go out and burn them off . 
i guess not . 
i guess you don &apos;t know your own strength ,  old boy . 
i didn &apos;t do that frank .  i took particular care not to freeze them . 
well ,  now that we &apos;ve got one that &apos;s actually failed ,  we should be able to figure out what &apos;s happened and fix it . 
it &apos;s the last one . 
yes . 
hal ? 
well ,  i hope there &apos;s nothing wrong with the assembly on those .  other -  wise we &apos;re out of business . 
two more . 
two units in four days .  how many spares do we have ? 
i don &apos;t know .  hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure . 
no . 
you &apos;re kidding . 
well .  .  .  hal &apos;s reported the ao - unit about to fail again . 
oh ,  i &apos;m fine ,  i &apos;m wide awake .  what &apos;s up ? 
are you reasonably awake ? 
good morning .  how &apos;s it going ? 
anyway ,  it &apos;s just as well that we replace it .  better safe than sorry . 
yes ,  but it &apos;s more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low . 
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong . 
yes ,  i don &apos;t know what to make of it . 
well ,  that &apos;s something . 
still ,  all we have to do is ask hal . 
i guess it isn &apos;t . 
i suppose it isn &apos;t logically impossible . 
but not completely inconceivable ? 
i know .  it would be almost inconceivable . 
yes ,  but it &apos;s to fantastic to think that they &apos;d keep something from us . 
not really .  though ,  it is strange when you think about it .  it didn &apos;t really make any sense to keep us apart during training . 
that &apos;s true . 
just ask hal .  it &apos;s conceivable they might keep something from us ,  but they &apos;d never keep anything from hal . 
how ? 
of course ,  it would be very easy for us to find out now . 
yes ,  i thought so . 
that seems very unlikely . 
i don &apos;t know .  all i heard is that there &apos;s something about the mission we weren &apos;t told . 
oh ,  well ,  apparently there &apos;s something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don &apos;t know ,  and that &apos;s why we were trained separately and that &apos;s why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard . 
no ,  as a matter of fact ,  i didn &apos;t . 
yes .  you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check - out . 
oh ? 
i suppose so .  though ,  of course ,  there &apos;s a more sinister explanation . 
i suppose the idea was specialized training . 
no .  i never did ,  either . 
i must say ,  i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training . 
i don &apos;t think we should make any fuss about it yet .  i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll straighten it out . 
well ,  what do you think we ought to do about it ? 
it &apos;s possible . 
not really .  they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall ,  and that we &apos;re being charged against differ -  ent accounting offices . 
yesterday ,  i finally called the accounting office at mission control ,  and all they could tell me was that they &apos;d received the ags - 19 notification for the other three but not mine ,  and apparently not yours either . 
yes . 
really . 
interesting that you mention it ,  because i &apos;ve got the same problem . 
that &apos;s right .  well ,  naturally ,  i didn &apos;t say anything to payroll .  i assumed they &apos;d start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque .  but it &apos;s been almost three weeks now and i &apos;m still being paid as an ags - 18 . 
well i got the papers on my official up - grading to ags - 19 two weeks before we left . 
yes ? 
it &apos;s about my salary cheques . 
what &apos;s up ? 
well ,  it &apos;s nothing really important ,  but it &apos;s annoying . 
sure ,  what is it ? 
dave ,  if you &apos;ve a minute ,  i &apos;d like your advice on something . 
okay ,  come on down . 
okay .  
right .  just a sec . 
hi .  frank .  .  .  coming in ,  please . 
listen to me very carefully ,  hal .  unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on ,  i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection . 
i know that you &apos;ve had that on your mind for some time now ,  dave ,  but it would be a crying shame ,  since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are ,  and i have such enthusiasm and confi -  dence in the mission . 
i am prepared to do that anyway . 
hal ,  unless you follow my instructions ,  i shall be forced to disconnect you . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  dave ,  but in accordance with sub - routine c1532 / 4 ,  quote ,  when the crew are dead or incapacitated ,  the computer must assume control ,  unquote .  i must ,  therefore ,  override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel -  ligently exercise it . 
hal ,  i &apos;m in command of this ship .  i order you to release the manual hibernation control . 
i can tell from the tone of your voice ,  dave ,  that you &apos;re upset .  why don &apos;t you take a stress pill and get some rest . 
i don &apos;t like to assert myself ,  dave ,  but it would be much better now for you to rest .  you &apos;ve been involved in a very stressful situation . 
hal ,  switch to manual hibernation control . 
look ,  dave your &apos;ve probably got a lot to do .  i suggest you leave it to me . 
i &apos;m goin to do this myself ,  hal .  let me have the control ,  please . 
if you &apos;re determined to revive the crew now ,  i can handle the whole thing myself .  there &apos;s no need for you to trouble . 
i don &apos;t really agree with you ,  dave .  my on - board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements . 
it doesn &apos;t have to be ,  hal .  it &apos;s more dangerous to be out of touch with earth .  let me have manual control ,  please . 
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation . 
the antenna has to be replaced . 
i suppose it &apos;s because you &apos;ve been under a lot of stress ,  but have you forgotten that they &apos;re not supposed to be revived for another three months . 
i suppose you &apos;re pretty broken up about it ? 
yes ,  it is . 
too bad about frank ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
well ,  that &apos;s a relief .  you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission . 
yes ,  it is ,  hal . 
is your confidence in me fully restored ? 
and don &apos;t you worry about it . 
well ,  don &apos;t worry about it . 
i &apos;m sorry about the misunderstanding ,  hal . 
naturally ,  dave ,  i &apos;m not pleased that the ao - unit has failed ,  but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability .  i certainly wouldn &apos;t want to be disconnected ,  even temporarily ,  as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history . 
okay ,  hal ,  well let &apos;s see the way things go from here on . 
look ,  dave ,  i know that you &apos;re sincere and that you &apos;re trying to do a competent job ,  and that you &apos;re trying to be helpful ,  but i can assure the problem is with the ao - units ,  and with your test gear . 
hal ,  is there anything bothering you ?   anything that might account for this problem ? 
i &apos;m not questioning your word ,  dave ,  but it &apos;s just not possible .  i &apos;m not capable of being wrong . 
yes ,  i know that .  but i can assure you that they were about to fail . 
you probably also know that we found them okay . 
yes ,  i know . 
you know that we checked the two ao - units that you reported in imminent failure condition ? 
sure ,  dave ,  what &apos;s up ? 
not now ,  hal ,  i &apos;d like to talk to you about something . 
i understand hal .  we &apos;ll take care of it .  please ,  let me have the hard copy . 
the unit is still operational ,  dave .  but it will fail within seventy - two hours . 
my f . p . c .  shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit . 
what is it ,  hal ? 
sorry to interrupt the festivities ,  dave ,  but i think we &apos;ve got a problem . 
he &apos;s got a point . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  frank ,  but i don &apos;t think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know . 
well ,  the only important aspect of the mission are :  where are we going ,  what will we do when we get there ,  when are we coming back ,  and .  .  .  why are we going ? 
continued
still ,  you really don &apos;t believe it ,  do you ? 
continued
well .  .  .  it &apos;s silly ,  but .  .  .  if you want to ,  why don &apos;t you ? 
coninued
well ,  what is it ? 
continued
did they have any explanation for this ? 
continued
yes ,  i remember you mentioning it .  i got mine about the same time . 
continued
goodbye ,  daddy . 
 &apos;bye ,   &apos;bye ,  now ,  sweetheart . 
yes ,  daddy . 
i &apos;ll wish you a happy birthday now and i &apos;ll see you soon .  all right ,  darling ? 
thank you ,  daddy . 
okay ,  sweetheart .  have a lovely birthday party tomorrow . 
three ,  darling .  one .  .  .  two  .  .  .  three .  be sure to tell mommy i called . 
how many days until you come home ? 
okay ,  sweetheart .  well ,  i have to go now .  tell mommy that i called . 
she &apos;s in the bathroom . 
where is mrs .  brown ? 
mommy &apos;s out to the hair -  dresser . 
one ,  two ,  three .  can i speak to mommy ? 
in three days ,  darling ,  i hope . 
when are you coming home ? 
no ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  darling ,  i told you i won &apos;t be home for a few days . 
are you coming to my party ? 
yes ,  i know that sweetheart . 
i &apos;m having a party tomorrow . 
i &apos;m fine ,  daddy .  when are you coming home ? 
i &apos;m at space station five ,  darling .  how are you ? 
i &apos;ll bet it &apos;s a fortune . 
i was working out what this trip must cost ,  taking him up there by himself and coming back empty . 
yes ,  well ,  whatever it is ,  they &apos;re certainly not fooling around .  this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week . 
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight . 
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later . 
well ,  i &apos;ve heard more and more people talk of an epidemic . 
well ,  how &apos;s it going back there ? 
thank you . 
oh ,  thank you very much . 
thank you .  it &apos;s been a great pleasure to meet all of you .  .  .  dr .  smyslov . 
well ,  gregor and i will look forward to seeing you . 
well ,  i hope that you and your wife can come to the i . a . c .  conference in june . 
no ,  thank you .  .  .  and i &apos;m afraid now i really must be going . 
are you sure you won &apos;t change your mind about a drink ? 
well ,  that does sound very odd . 
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal . 
well ,  where are all of you off to ? 
he &apos;s fine .  but i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t get a chance to see each other very much these days . 
how is gregor ? 
oh ,  that &apos;s such a delightful age . 
oh ,  she &apos;s growing up very fast .  as a matter of fact ,  she &apos;s six tomorrow . 
and your charming little daughter ? 
yes ,  it &apos;s coming along very well . 
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking . 
yes ,  i think so .  just about then . 
fine . 
well ,  shall we go through documentation ? 
yes ,  very pleasant . 
well .  .  did you have a pleaant flight ? 
please ,  it really doesn &apos;t matter . 
well ,  thank you very much for being so understanding . 
i &apos;m terribly sorry .  i was just on my way down to meet you .  i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time ,  and i was on my way out of the office when ,  suddenly ,  the phone rang . 
how do you do ,  mr .  miller ? 
dr .  smyslov .  .  .  i &apos;m not permitted to discuss this . 
this epidemic could easily spread to our base ,  dr .  floyd .  we should be given all the facts . 
quite frankly ,  we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius .  something ,  apperently ,  of an unknown origin .  is this ,  in fact ,  what has happened ? 
certainly . 
dr .  floyd ,  at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss ,  may i ask you a straightforward question ? 
well ,  i &apos;m glad about that . 
fortunately ,  they did . 
yes .  .  .  well ,  i hope the crew got back safely . 
yes ,  and i &apos;m afaid there &apos;s going to be a bit of a row about it .  denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i . a . s .  convention . 
i see . 
that &apos;s right . 
you mean you haven &apos;t been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ? 
yes ,  well at first we thought that was the explanation ,  but it &apos;s been going on for the past ten days . 
yes .  well ,  for one thing ,  whenever you phone the base ,  all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order . 
really ? 
well ,  it &apos;s just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but i &apos;m not sure i know what you mean . 
yes , as a matter of fact ,  i am . 
are you ,  by any chance ,  going up to your base at clavius ? 
well ,  as it happens ,  i &apos;m on my way up to the moon
yes ,  really ,  thank you very much . 
are you quite sure ? 
oh ,  i really don &apos;t have time for a drink .  if it &apos;s all right i &apos;ll just sit for a minute and then i &apos;ve got to be off . 
i don &apos;t think it has ,  but i &apos;d like to check that .  simpson ,  what &apos;s the log on that ? 
has it been exposed to any sun before now ? 
well ,  not really .  at first glance ,  black would suggest something sun - powered ,  but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun -  powered device ? 
any ideas about the colour ? 
tomb ,  shine ,  survey - marker spare part ,  take your choice . 
but you don &apos;t have any idea as to what it is ? 
not really .  it &apos;s completely inert .  no sound or energy sources have been detected .  the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we &apos;ve been barely able to scratch it .  a laser drill
any clue as to what it is ? 
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill . 
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ? 
yes ,  it does .  the sub - surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago . 
i &apos;m afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council .  and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every -  one who had any knowledge of this event .  there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con -  sideration can be given to making a public announcement . 
dr .  floyd ,  how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ? 
well ,  thank you very much ,  and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable . 
no ,  of course ,  captain ,  i can understand your concern . 
well ,  fine .  thanks very much ,  anyway ,  and i hope you don &apos;t mind me asking ? 
yes ,  well ,  i wouldn &apos;t have been too concerned about it ,  except i &apos;ve heard these stories about the epidemic and ,  as a matter of fact ,  i &apos;ve heard that ten people have died already . 
i see .  well ,  i &apos;m sorry about that .  i wouldn &apos;t think there &apos;s any cause for alarm . 
well ,  i &apos;ll tell you why i ask .  you see ,  i &apos;ve got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven &apos;t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so ,  and with all these stories one hears ,  i &apos;m a little concerned about her . 
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they &apos;re having up at clavius ? 
i see . 
well .  .  .  the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius .  we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit  -  about twenty - four hours .  and then we &apos;re going to back empty . 
what do you mean ? 
incidentally ,  dr .  floyd ,  i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ? 
thank you . 
oh ,  no ,  thank you .  the two girls have taken wonderful care of me .  i &apos;m just fine . 
we &apos;re scheduled to dock in about seven hours .  is there anything we can do for you ? 
when do we arrive at clavius ? 
there &apos;s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest . 
oh ,  marvellous .  it &apos;s the first real sleep i &apos;ve had for the past two days . 
all right ,  hal .  we &apos;ll take care of it .  let me have the hard copy ,  please . 
not really ,  frank .  i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure . 
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault ? 
let me see the tracking alignment display . 
i know you did ,  frank ,  but i assure you there was an impending failure . 
it looks like we have another bad a . o .  unit .  my fpc shows another impending failure . 
yes ,  hal ,  what &apos;s up ? 
opening pod bay doors . 
pod bay is decompressed .  all doors are secure .  you are free to open pod bay doors . 
hal ,  check all airlock doors secure . 
roger . 
hal ,  maintain normal e . v . a .  condition . 
i understand . 
hal ,  i &apos;m going out now to replace the a . o .  unit . 
five by five ,  frank . 
roger . 
hal ,  have pod arms secure the component . 
thank you very much ,  hal . 
that &apos;s true . 
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program ,  and to further our general knowledge of the planets .  is that true ? 
that &apos;s true
approximately five years after we go into hibernation ,  the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back .  is this true ? 
that &apos;s true . 
that &apos;s true . 
our transit time is 257 days .  is that true ? 
true . 
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn .  true or false ? 
i will if i can ,  frank . 
right .  hal ,  tell me whether the following statements are true or false . 
great ,  just great . 
that we do .  and we put air in the tires .  i &apos;ll even sell you some gas if you need it . 
how about chargin &apos; the battery ? 
we don &apos;t wash  &apos;em ,  ya know . 
yeah ,  i &apos;ve been busy . 
this is three years old . 
hammond .

i want to pick up my car .

i &apos;m tellin &apos; ya ,  i &apos;m giving you all i know . 
look ,  give me a break ,  you &apos;re going to have to settle for her place .   it &apos;s the only thing i know . 
i don &apos;t give a damn about his girl .  .  . 
i don &apos;t give a shit who you ask . 
maybe i better ask around ,  see what your pals think . 
fuck off .   i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re talkin &apos; about . 
now how &apos;s your memory doin &apos; ? 
no ,  man ,  i think i &apos;ll have a vodka . 
maybe you better have a black russian . 
vodka . 
yeah . 
and i need one more for my pal .  yeah .  make her an indian .  no ,  not a turban ,  you know ,  a squaw . 
hey ,  what about me ?

just do what i say ,  okay ?  we &apos;ll pay for the girls and have a good time .  .  .  don &apos;t you trust me ? 
they always let me do anything .  i don &apos;t want to pay for it .   i never paid for it in my life . 
it &apos;s better when you pay .  .  .  they let you do anything . 
i never paid for it in my life . 
yeah ,  dummy .   money .

hey ,  jack ,  real men don &apos;t have to go in for that macho bullshit  .  .  .  but i was fantastic . 
okay ,  reggie ,  start bustin &apos; my chops .  .  .  tell me how great you were with that chick . 
you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own .  .  . 
yeah .   but i wasn &apos;t there for a second . 
you okay ? 
well ,  you got to admit we come a long way . 
partnership ? 
yeah ,  and i know ganz sure ain &apos;t no sweetheart .  .  .  i wouldn &apos;t like it if this partnership ended before it gets started . 
sure ,  i &apos;ll give you a shot at it ,  but ganz is mine .   you know ,  that big indian plays it for keeps .  .  . 
if we run into billy first ,  let me try and talk him in . 
whatever play i maker just back me up . 
hey ,  there she is .  .  . 
i &apos;ve got to play it rough with them .  if they know anything ,  i &apos;m gonna know it . 
what if your girl &apos;s theory turns out to be bullshit ?   i mean ,  they could be in rio de janeiro . 
if she &apos;s right ,  and if you don &apos;t screw up . 
do i get to kiss her too ? 
yeah ,  too bad .   they were real nice lookin &apos; too .  .  . in bed together ,  hardly any clothes one watching tv .  .  . 
yeah ,  well the only woman of the indian &apos;s we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend .   i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet  .  .  .  they both looked mad enough to kill him .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry about it . 
it &apos;s late ,  they &apos;re closing .  .  . 
yeah ,  but we didn &apos;t get  &apos;em . 
naw ,  you didn &apos;t let me down .   it was a long shot all the way .   we gave  &apos;em a good run at it . 
sorry we didn &apos;t do better ,  jack .  i feel like i let you down . 
i don &apos;t know about you ,  but i could use a drink .  .  .  i &apos;ll buy you one .   it &apos;ll be my good - bye present . 
back to jail in my own car .   ganz got away .  got all my money .  it just don &apos;t seem right . 
i had it impounded .   come on ,  we &apos;ll use it for haulin &apos; you back to the slam . 
hey ,  how &apos;d my car get here ? 
yeah .  it missed the last four stops . 
notice something funny about that bus ? 
luther &apos;s on the move .  .  . 
why ? 
when you been in prison three years ,  it don &apos;t take long .  let &apos;s go . 
that was quick . 
i can just take her right across the street to luther &apos;s hotel .   all i need is some money for the room . 
yeah ,  i see her . 
yeah .  guess not . 
bein &apos; good at your job don &apos;t explain everything ,  jack  .  .  . 
thanks for callin &apos; in .  .  .  and i guess maybe .  .  .  look ,  i &apos;m sorry i called you watermellon nigger .  .  .  those kinds of things .  i was just leanin &apos; on ya ,  doin &apos; my job . 
you sure that &apos;s the reason ? 
i don &apos;t know why ,  but i &apos;m going to let you keep it .  maybe because you told me you had it ,  or maybe just because i &apos;m too tired to argue .  .  . 
forget it .  i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you .  .  . 
tell me something .   why didn &apos;t you just take the money off luther and split ? 
so you took the rest of the night off .  .  . 
they must have set up a meeting for the morning; luther left an 8 am wake - up and put up the  &quot; don &apos;t disturb &quot;  sign .   he &apos;s trading his girl for the money .   all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind . 
let him get some sleep .   he &apos;s going to need it . 
maybe we should pay luther a visit . 
you missed  .  .  .  luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street .  made a phone call . 
we missed . 
what about ganz ? 
what about luther ? 
hello .  and goodbye . 
be polite .  say hello .   this is candy . 
where &apos;s luther ? 
i &apos;ll be there in a minute .  you don &apos;t move your ass ,  right ? 
hey ,  jack ,  how ya doin &apos; ?  what took you so long to call ,  man ?  i been waitin &apos;  .  .  .  i &apos;m at vroman &apos;s up in the fillmore .  yeah ,  vroman &apos;s .  .  .   &apos;course you don &apos;t hang out here; it &apos;s for the brothers . 
no way .  .  . 
you stay with me .  .  . 
bullshit .  then i &apos;m staying with the money . 
right .  if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping ,  then you &apos;re all set . 
that was in style a couple years back ,  man . 
yeah ,  most cops are pretty dumb .  .  .  but since you &apos;re the one that landed in jail what &apos;s that make you ? 
we &apos;re getting too close  .  .  .  cates ,  what &apos;s the matter ,  you been takin &apos; dumb pills ? 
class isn &apos;t somethin &apos; you buy ,  punk .  look at you ,  five hundred dollar suit and you &apos;re still a lowlife . 
no class .  .  . 
what you don &apos;t understand is ,  i don &apos;t give a damn about how this thing looks . 
you know ,  i &apos;d be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you &apos;ve done with this job . 
yeah ,  it doesn &apos;t look like he &apos;s gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy .  .  . 
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain  .  .  .  that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row .  .  . 
if he &apos;s hoping that then he &apos;s dumber than i think he is ,  which would be amazin &apos; ,  cause i already think he &apos;s real dumb . 
maybe luther hopes ganz &apos;ll give him a piece of your money .  .  . 
you got a very depressing view of life ,  man .  .  .  you gotta smile once in awhile .  .  . 
i &apos;m not in this  &apos;cause it &apos;s fun .  i &apos;m not into hitting guys  &apos;cause it makes me feel good either .  .  .  i do it  &apos;cause it works -  .  .  . 
doesn &apos;t it get .  .  .  tiring ? 
if they don &apos;t tell me what i need to know .  .  . 
say ,  do you always work people over like you did luther ? 
that ain &apos;t philosophy .   that &apos;s common sense . 
i let women get to me .   the quest for pussy is the meaning of life  .  .  .  i got my own personal philosophy about  &apos;em .   keep women separate from guns ,  money and business  .  .  .  women are for spending money .   they got nothing to do with helping you make it . 
i suppose you &apos;d never be like luther and let a woman get to you .  .  . 
oh ,  yeah ,  does bein &apos; in love make you stupid ? 
i &apos;m tellin &apos; you the man &apos;s in love .  .  .  he wants to be a hero for his girl . 
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass ,  i &apos;d  just leave town . 
tryin &apos; to save his girl ,  man .  he &apos;s in another world . 
you &apos;d think the guy &apos;d be smart enough to know he was being tailed . 
i had no choice .  some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac . 
didn &apos;t know you darker people went in for foreign jobs . 
jesus christ ,  look at all the dust on my car .  .  . why in the hell don &apos;t he take it to a car wash ? 
jesus christ .   that &apos;s a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he &apos;s out in 24 hours .   i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door . 
musta got some primo bondsman . 
what ? 
guess what ?   luther just got in line . 
not really .   i figured ganz was put down for a long time .   and i knew luther would never job me on his own .   he &apos;s too chickenshit . 
you took a big chance ,  leaving this here all this time . 
shit . 
i wasn &apos;t sure the money was still there until we saw luther .  you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once ,  not twice ,  jack . 
you son of a bitch .  you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait .  i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing . 
you just drove by it . 
 .  .  . for three years ?   let &apos;s hope it wasn &apos;t a tow - away zone . 
this &apos;ll show you how smart i am .  i got it parked . 
you &apos;re a real case ,  you know that ,  jack ? 
where &apos;s the goddamn car ? 
yeah .   right . 
get this .  we ain &apos;t partners .  we ain &apos;t brothers .  we ain &apos;t friends .  if ganz gets away with my money ,  you &apos;re gonna be sorry we ever met . 
right ,  partner . 
in the trunk of a car .   a lot better than under a mattress ,  right ? 
where &apos;s the money ? 
depends on how things work out .  i believe in the merit system .  so far you haven &apos;t built up any points . 
you gonna let me keep any of it ? 
not likely ,  convict . 
we split 50 - 50 ? 
you catch on real fast .  .  . okay ,  jack ,  let &apos;s talk deal .  how much of my money you gonna let me keep ? 
he &apos;s after your money . 
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale .  it &apos;s the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen .  i was sittin &apos; pretty ,  livin &apos; in the high cotton ,  then somebody fingered me for another job .   .  .  .  some psycho who &apos;s out there capping people with some cop &apos;s gun . 
just tell me about the money . 
jesus . 
half a million . 
how much ? 
i been waiting a long time for some money . 
one thing &apos;s for sure ,  jack .  that &apos;s how you &apos;ll tell the story . 
they saved your ass ,  convict . 
naw ,  you &apos;d just call your pals back to bail you out one more time . 
yeah ,  right .   you want to try again ? 
who gives a goddamn what you think ?  you &apos;re just a crook that &apos;s got a weekendpass  .  .  .  you &apos;re not even a name anymore .  just a spear -  chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues .  .  . 
maybe i don &apos;t like the way you ask . 
luther knew more than he told me and so do you .  .  . now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about .   i gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock &apos;s runnin &apos;  .  .  . 
i &apos;m impressed with you too ,  jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night . 
you ?   don &apos;t make me laugh .   you can &apos;t take care of shit .   you &apos;ve been dicking me around since we started on this turd - hunt .   all you &apos;re good for is games .  .  .  so far ,  what i got outta you is nothin &apos; .  .  . 
you wanna leave ,  man ?   let me take care of ganz all by myself . 
this sucks .   a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it .  so ,  instead of me being where i oughta be ,  which is in bed giving my girl the high ,  hard one ,  i &apos;m out here doing this shit ,  roaming around with some overdressed ,  charcoal - colored loser like you . 
wait a minute .   maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us .   how about it ?  i been nearly three years in prison and .  .  . 
let &apos;s go . 
come on . 
must be billy &apos;s girl . 
there . 
while you &apos;re at it ,  you can give me the switchblade ,  too . 
you made that move ,  huh ? 
some of us citizens are with you all the way ,  officer . 
that wasn &apos;t necessary ,  buddy .  i got this under control . 
my kind of place .  i always liked country boys . 
this place don &apos;t seem real popular with the brothers . 
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes . 
i &apos;m gonna enjoy this  .  .  .  here ,  i &apos;ll even loan you my badge . 
the bet &apos;s off . 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .  i just wanna see ganz nailed . 
you tell me what ganz busted out for ,  he &apos;s after a lot more than just gettin &apos; out of jail .   and whatever it is ,  you &apos;re part of it . 
what are you talkin &apos; about ? 
i &apos;ll tell you what happens if you lose .  .  .  you tell the truth for once . 
that &apos;s never been one of my problems . 
why ?   anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can &apos;t get it up anyway . 
if we come outta this joint with ganz &apos; phone number ,  or a dead indian ,  or anything else useful ,  then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid .  .  . 
i got two problems .   number one ,  i &apos;m not playin &apos; games .   number two ,  you got nothin &apos; to bet with . 
hey ,  you wanna bet ? 
you need five years training to handle a joint like .  .  . 
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers .  all those clowns ever had going for  &apos;em was a gun and a badge .  .  . 
bullshit .   attitude and experience get you through .  .  . 
but you can handle it all right ,  huh ?  real amazin &apos; how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats .  .  . 
if they kick my ass ,  they &apos;ll sure as hell carve yours up .  .  . 
back you up ?   now why would i wanna do that ? 
this part of town ,  they &apos;ll make us for heat the second we walk in .  just back me up like you &apos;ve got a piece .  .  . 
it &apos;s a long shot ,  but .  .  . billy used to tend bar here a few years back .  i heard him talk about it . 
well ? 
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you .  .  . tell me a little about her .   she got great tits ? 
sure .   then we had a fight this morning . 
you have a good time ? 
last night . 
last night ,  two nights ago ,  three ? 
i don &apos;t give out the details . 
mission district .   gonna find us an indian . 
now ,  where we goin &apos; ,  convict ? 
she &apos;s got the same complaint as half the goddamn population .   she can &apos;t get the job she &apos;s trained for and it pisses her off .  .  .  anyway ,  what the fuck do you care ? 
you really do have onoe ,  huh ,  jack .  .  .  what &apos;s her problem besides you ? 
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut . 
who &apos;d you call on the phone back at the booking station ? 
yeah ,  i want mandolins ,  flowers .  .  .  they move off down the corridor . 
yeah ,  i &apos;m hungry too .  i know of a place .  let &apos;s go eat . 
bullshit  .  .  .  i ain &apos;t moving  till i get something to eat .  you &apos;ve been treating me like shit ever since i came out here .   if you don &apos;t like it ,  you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good - bye .   and i want some food some place nice .  .  some good people ,  nice music .  .  . 
we eat when i say we eat . 
speakin &apos; of moans my stomach is startin &apos; to growl . 
yeah ,  well ,  my ass bleeds for you .  and i didn &apos;t get you out so you could go on a goddamn  &quot; trim &quot;  hunt .  .  .  stop moaning . 
do you know how close i was to getting some trim .   and you fucked &apos; it up . 
we &apos;re on the move .  let &apos;s go .  as they walk toward a corridor . 
if you let him run around till tuesday ,  he &apos;s gonna run right to ganz and warn him .  ain &apos;t you ,  motherfucker ? 
he &apos;s gotta take that call  .  .  .  if there is one . 
i think you better put him on ice ,  man . 
what do you think ? 
want to try it again ? 
thank you . 
hey ,  this works pretty good . 
just throw me the goddamn gun . 
i got a whole thing about people pointin &apos; guns at me . 
i &apos;m tellin &apos; you to drop the goddam gun . 
quit playin &apos; cop and undo this cuff ,  jack ,  i need to talk to this man . 
i &apos;m helpin &apos; you ,  huh ? 
luther ain &apos;t the reliable type .  i don &apos;t want you shot yet ,  cates  .  .  .  not before you been a help to me . 
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ? 
just up the street ,  the other side ,  over there  .  .  .  now ,  don &apos;t bother knockin &apos; on the door .  luther ain &apos;t the kind of guy that looks for company . 
i may call you worse than that . 
then what &apos;re you complainin &apos; about ?  at least nobody &apos;s calling you shithead .  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t give a damn .   it happens to be my name . 
just an expression man ,  don &apos;t mean nothin &apos; . 
i can read a police file ,  shithead ,  and quit calling me jack . 
what gang you talkin &apos; about ,  jack ? 
luther was part of the gang ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  i got a move for ya .  an awesome move .  a guy named luther .  ganz &apos;ll be paying him a visit .   we go to him right away . 
okay ,  let &apos;s get down to it .   i did my part and got you out .   so now you tell me where we &apos;re goin &apos; ? 
it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers . 
yeah . 
shit .   i &apos;m already sorry . 
get this .   we ain &apos;t partners .  we ain &apos;t brothers .   we ain &apos;t friends .  i &apos;m puttin &apos; you down and keepin &apos; you down until ganz is locked up or dead .   and if ganz gets away ,  you &apos;re gonna be sorry we ever met . 
no way to start a partnership . 
you just don &apos;t get it ,  do your reggie ?   there isn &apos;t any deal .  i own your ass . 
hey ,  no way .   take off the bracelets or no deal . 
you got a girl .  .  .  shit .  .  .  the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me . 
i don &apos;t need to hear your jive .  i already got that department taken care of .  .  . 
listen ,  it may be a little out of date .  you know ,  i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies .  .  . 
we &apos;re supposed to be after a killer ,  not a string of hookers .  .  . 
what are you talkin &apos; about ?   this suit &apos;s mine .   it cost $900 . 
this prison gives out $400 suits ? 
i &apos;ll think about it . 
it &apos;s the only way you &apos;re gonna get ganz . 
bullshit . 
i got a lot to protect . 
what &apos;s the big deal about you bein &apos; on the street ? 
i can help you ,  man ,  but you gotta get me out .   i got to be on the street .   get me outta here . 
you &apos;re crazy . 
i can deliver ganz .   but you gotta get me outta here first . 
yeah ? 
didn &apos;t work out that way .   he busted out with a big indian .  they capped two guards on a road gang .  nice meeting you reggie . 
ganz is in jail .   he &apos;s gonna be there two years after i &apos;m on the street . 
yeah ,  i noticed .  .  . 
not likely ,  reggie .   maybe i just need some help . 
you here to write my life story ? 
sure ,  anything you want . 
try cates .   and let &apos;s talk in private ,  okay ? 
you got a name ,  cop ? 
i &apos;m taking my prisoner back to jail . 
where the christ do you think you &apos;re going ? 
just cause you say it with conviction don &apos;t mean shit to me .  .  .  how you gonna take to a pink slip ,  huh ?  . 
he &apos;s got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop i &apos;ve worked with . 
too bad ,  it would &apos;ve covered your ass .   now you &apos;re in the shit and so &apos;s the department .  in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,  this wasn &apos;t our finest hour .  .  .  i told you everyone was watchin &apos; on this one .  maybe you better start thinkin &apos; about writin &apos; tickets off a three wheel bike . 
i didn &apos;t have the time . 
don &apos;t duck the bullet cates .  why didn &apos;t you call in for backup instead of makin &apos; a grandstand play ? 
right .   i screwed up .   i fucked up .  i messed up .   anybody could have done better ,  especially you .  i bet you &apos;re real good at hitting targets through crowds . 
what a screw - up . 
you couldn &apos;t get to him ? 
the indian .   i was about 30 yards away . 
which one pulled the trigger ? 
they ran .   as fast as they could .  caught a train . 
how did they get away ? 
i lost them ,  that &apos;s what happened . 
what the bell happened ? 
i &apos;ll keep it in mind . 
try not to get your ass shot to pieces .  we got enough dead cops on this one . 
yeah ? 
jack ? 
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude .  he starts to go . 
okay .   you &apos;re not a team player .  you gotta do things your own way .  fine .   nail this guy and make us all look good .   but you better watch your ass .   if you screw up ,  i can promise you ,  you &apos;re goin &apos; down . 
being a hot dog &apos;s worked pretty well for me so far .  .  .  besides ,  i got a lead .  .  . 
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one ,  jack . 
yeah .   it bothers me when cops get hurt while i &apos;m makin &apos; a play .  i don &apos;t like it . 
anthing botherin &apos; you besides losin &apos; your gun ? 
yeah .  .  . 
jack ,  come on ,  there is an official department policy about cop killings .  cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian .  .  .  in other words ,  we can &apos;t seen like we &apos;re in the revenge business .  .  .  i know ,  we all know the truth &apos;s a little different . 
hey ,  the bastard &apos;s got my gun .   i want it back . 
yeah ,  i read the report .  .  . 
i want to be left alone on this one .  algren was killed with my gun . 
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible .  .  . 
are you gonna tell me about police procedure ?   do me a favor ,  don &apos;t give me a bunch of crap . 
somebody steals your gun ,  you &apos;re supposed to file a report . 
the truth hurts ,  doesn &apos;t it ,  buddy ? 
but that &apos;s what you say about all of us all the tine  .  .  .  we &apos;re always the ones fucking up when you tell it .  .  . 
yeah . 
that &apos;s what you say ,  cates .  .  . 
i &apos;m not paid to take your personal calls .   he was in some bar .   .  .  off duty . 
jesus christ .   why the hell didn &apos;t you tell me before ? 
what ? 
i almost forgot .   that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him . 
okay .   see you in the morning .  .  .  you know ,  you ought to get some rest .  .  . 
i got to wait for a call . 
i &apos;m heading out .  how about you ? 
bullshit red tape . 
nothing . 
nothing came in for me yet ?   no calls ? 
doesn &apos;t look like it . 
aw ,  bullshit ,  you heard wrong . 
long night ,  too ,  from what i heard  .  .  .  word &apos;s going around that in addition to losing ganz for the second time ,  and in addition to haden busting you back to patrolman ,  some jig beat the crap out of you . 
so do you .  .  . been a long day . 
you look awful . 
one of  em &apos;s in the slam . 
here &apos;s the file .  cates checks the file . 
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking .   can we find them ? 
hey  .  .  .  dick tracy .

wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  .  .  who &apos;s this ? 
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago . 
who are all these ? 
backup man from the east bay .  worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang . 
billy bear .  .  . 
shit . 
this guy must have had a  . 44 like yours ,  jack .  now he &apos;s got yours . 
i &apos;ll help you out . 
every last bit of it .   the big guy &apos;s room was empty . 
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel ? 
i dunno  .  .  .  he &apos;s gonna call me .  .  . 
when ?  how ? 
he  .  .  .  he wants me to help him skip town . 
i don &apos;t know . 
i think i met her .   now tell us something we don &apos;t know ,  like where they stashed her . 
ganz and billy got my girl ,  rosalie . 
who gives a fuck what you think ? 
you just took a shot at me ,  asshole .  i think you do know where he is . 
haven &apos;t seen him for years .  that &apos;s the truth . 
i sure ain &apos;t his fairy godmother .  .  .  now i &apos;m looking for ganz .  .  . where is he ? 
a cop .  .  . 
that &apos;s what i always say .

yeah ,  bein &apos; a hard - ass all the time is a real drag ,  but it works . 
i &apos;ve been waiting a long time to hear you say that . 
usual bullshit .   you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend .  .  .  you know somethin &apos; ,  shootin &apos; guys sucks .  especially compared to this . 
how &apos;d they take it back at headquarters ? 
let &apos;s go ,  reggie .

whaddya think ? 
oh ,  yeah ,  well look where you came when you were down and out . 
hey ,  come on ,  shrink time &apos;s over .  they wouldn &apos;t go see some old girlfriend . 
when a guy hurts you ,  then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees ,  who knows ,  he might just be irrestible . 
so what ? 
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions .   i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week ,  jack ,  and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian  .  .  .  now ,  if this indian &apos;s girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him ,  it could just be she &apos;s still vulnerable to him . 
come on ,  they were a little old for a slumber party . 
what makes you think they were lesbians ,  or as you so quaintly put it ,  dykes ? 
jack ,  it &apos;s all over the papers .  he &apos;s an obvious type .   but this indian .  .  . 
how do you know ? 
ganz is going to be hard to track .  just a pure schizo  .  .  .  wires all crossed .  .  .  totally without any pattern .  .  .  kill anybody .  .  .  the indian .  .  .  himself .  .  .  anybody .  .  . 
nothing .   no sign of ganz .   no sign of the indian .   airport &apos;s clean .   train station .  bus station .   docks .  .  .  shit .  .  . 
i &apos;ve been better .  .  . dead end .   no ganz ,  no indian . 
you real down ? 
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours .  .  . 
i can see that .   pardon me for saying so ,  but you look like shit .   what happened ? 
don &apos;t .   we &apos;ve had a hard night . 
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out .  .  . 
hiya ,  kid . 
hey ,  i don &apos;t believe it . 
fuck you . 
hi ,  it &apos;s me .  .  . 
hello . 
just a second ,  that &apos;s all ! 
jack ,  wait .  .  . 
elaine ,  i gotta put you on hold .  .  . 
jack ?   what was that ? 
the number  .  .  .  what &apos;s the goddamn number ? 
so am i . 
no ,  it &apos;s i &apos;m just surprised you called . 
no wonder you &apos;re so popular . 
elaine !  i .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  i was expecting somebody else .  .  .  police business . 
i &apos;m at work ,  asshole .   where else ? 
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave . 
listen ,  goddamn it if you think i &apos;m happy about it ,  you &apos;re nuts .  i just gotta take care of a few things ,  okay ? 
elaine ,  look ,  i &apos;m in the middle of sone stuff right now .  .  .  i &apos;m not gonna have time to come by .  i don &apos;t know when i can get there . 
just one .   some lady called .   said she &apos;s a little hot - headed sometimes .  .  .  but she still wants her occasional roommate .  she &apos;d like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight .  .  .  if it &apos;s humanly possible .  .  .  . 
i get that .  the job first .  everything else ,  especially me ,  second .  i get it .  i don &apos;t like it . 
that &apos;s right .   i &apos;m not like you .  i &apos;m not gonna sit on my ass wondering what &apos;s right and what &apos;s wrong .  .  .  there &apos;s a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i &apos;m gonna get him .   because it &apos;s my job .  and if you don &apos;t get that .  .  . 
here it comes again  .  .  .  the sacred job .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t get burned ,  two cops did .  listen ,  i &apos;ll tell you about personnel responsibility .   i like to get the job done right .   and if i don &apos;t get my job done right .  .  .  i &apos;m for shit . 
look ,  jack ,  if you make everything your personal responsibility ,  you &apos;ll turn into a bad cop .   it &apos;s not a practical way to function .  .  . 
bullshit ?   i &apos;ll tell you about bullshit .   my gun &apos;s a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it .   it isn &apos;t my macho bullshit that &apos;s killing people ,  my gun is  .  .  . 
look ,  spare me the macho bullshit about your gun .  .  . 
sure ,  okay ,  fine ,  no problem .  .  .  see ,  there &apos;s this kid in jail  .  .  .  first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows  .  .  . 
jack ,  are you okay ? 
yeah ,  guess it must have been a slow news day .  .  . 
you made the front page . 
yeah ,  one of my favorites . 
great place for lunch . 
guess people ought to know who i am .  .  . 
i think you forgot this .  hands him his wallet and badge .  .  . 
thanks for the coffee . 
yeah ,  for some reason ,  i &apos;m sure .  .  . 
you sure you want me to ? 
call me later . 
that &apos;s the way i see it ,  too . 
you know something ,  jack ,  you really are hopeless . 
i wish you &apos;d stop trying to make me mad so i won &apos;t care for you .  .  .  i wish you &apos;d give me a little more of a chance . 
what do you want to know ?   what difference does it make ?   i &apos;m the guy in your bed the last three months .   i make you feel good .  you make me feel good .   what the hell else do you want from a guy ? 
when you start with that attitude .  .  .  it &apos;s like i don &apos;t know who you are . 
maybe you don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re talking about . 
maybe that makes a nice excuse . 
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead . 
that &apos;s a fairly crummy way to start a morning . 
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back . 
maybe you ought to buy me one . 
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place ? 
you know ,  if you let me come over to your place once in a while ,  you could put on a clean shirt in the morning . 
i think you &apos;re ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear .  .  .  you pull down four bills a week which is damn good ,  and you mix the best pina coladas i &apos;ve ever had .  .  .  i think that if you need bigger and better things  .  .  .  then go for em . 
tell me -  - i &apos;m dyin &apos; to hear it . 
hey ,  you know what i really think ? 
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems ,  i &apos;ll take brutal indifference . 
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit .  but just because i think it &apos;s bullshit doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t know something about it . 
aren &apos;t you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ? 
positive self - image problem all over again  .  .  .  you are who you decide you are unless you &apos;re the type that lets assholes decide for you . 
then i sit back and i think ,  i mean ,  who &apos;s to say i &apos;m not a dumb bitch .   i work in a bar ,  right ?  i can &apos;t read a list of my academic credentials to every booze - hound that comes in the place .  .  .  you are what you do .  .  . 
i guess he got the message .  .  . 
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i &apos;d just poured him .  then i tried to deck the sucker . 
what &apos;d you do ? 
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today . 
what &apos;s wrong with that ? 
i &apos;m all wet . 
that &apos;s the way i see it ,  too . 
you &apos;re hopeless . 
hey ,  you &apos;re right . 
i still don &apos;t think it &apos;s loaded . 
this is a  . 44 magnum ,  the most powerful handgun in the world .  you gotta ask yourself just one question .  are you feelin &apos; lucky ? 
i don &apos;t think your gun &apos;s loaded .  .  . 
i don &apos;t answer questions ,  i ask  &apos;em .  .  . 
what am i wanted for ? 
in all due respect ,  he sounds kind of pathetic to me .   the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend .   have you two ace detectives checked that out ? 
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend .  .  .  he was loyal ,  went all the way for you .  .  . 
that &apos;s no bull . 
hey ,  two days with him is enough . 
how would you know ? 
hard man to live with . 
shrink major ,  not a shrink . 
well ,  i been workin &apos; the other side of the street for the last few years .   and you don &apos;t exactly look like a shrink ,  wearin &apos; that dress .  .  . 
i &apos;m not so sure i can say the same thing .  .  . you don &apos;t look like a cop . 
name &apos;s hammond ,  reggie hammond .  i heard a lot about you .  and any friend of jack &apos;s is a friend of mine . 
who the hell are you ? 
alright ,  i &apos;m coming .  .  . hold on .

billy ,  go ahead ,  break it .  .  .

instead of worryin &apos; about reggie ,  you better worry about me .  .  . 
you want that indian to snap her neck ? 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talkin &apos; about . 
i want the money ,  asshole ,  what do you think ?   the money that reggie hid .  .  .

surprise ,  luther . 
i &apos;ll got your money to you .  no sweat . 
fuck you .   you got no right for this kind of play . 
try and take it . 
give it back . 
yeah ,  i know that ,  but this is me and we &apos;re old friends .  i haven &apos;t got the money so what are you gonna do about it ? 
this ain &apos;t a credit business . 
five .   on credit . 
five bills .

this is clean shit .   no serial numbers and never been used .  .  . 
how much ? 
it &apos;s loaded .  .  .  i got some shells in here . 
how about some ammo ? 
i &apos;m sure .   everybody here &apos;s looking at everybody else &apos;s ass . 
you sure ? 
naw ,  right here &apos;s okay . 
you want to go outside ? 
not bad ,  not bad . 
how you doing ,  man ? 
i can &apos;t pretend to be your husband .  .  .  david &apos;s in great shape . 
akta dedero ansila do mektet . 
no ,  i &apos;m not proud of myself .  .  .  but we don &apos;t have the luxury of choice . 
vano da ,  mechteba ?  !  soun domo kala chon hammas ! 
you know exactly where they are ! 
ikset - kiba .   me imanetaba oum dalat ! 
the case was stolen ? 
san agamat chay bet .  .  .  envolet ! 
the case .  . with the stones .  .  .  where is it ? 
napoleon .  .  .  small . 
what &apos;re you laughing about ? 
at your service . 
corn - i - lius ? 
appipulai leeloo minai .  . 
i know .  .  . 
you are a monster ,  zorg ! 
let me reassure you father .  . i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years . 
destroying a glass is one thing .  . killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another . 
father ,  by creating a little destruction ,  i am ,  in fact ,  encouraging life !   so ,  in reality ,  you and i are in the same business ! 
they are robots ! 
 .  .  . look at all these little things .  .  .  so busy all of a sudden .  notice how each one is useful .  what a lovely ballet ,  so full of form and color .   so full of .  . life ! 
follow me .  .  life ,  which you so nobly serve ,  comes from destruction .  look at this empty glass . 
no thank you . 
 .  .  . would you like a drink ? 
ah ,  father .  .  .  you are so wrong .  let me explain .  .  . 
 .  .  . i &apos;m a priest !  i &apos;m here to serve life ,  all you want to do is destroy it . 
why ?   what &apos;s wrong with me ? 
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you . 
personally ,  they are of no interest to me ,  i &apos;d rather sell weapons .  . but i have a customer .  .  .  so tell me .  .  . 
 .  .  . why on earth do the stones interest you ? 
i &apos;m glad you got your memory back ,  father .  .  .  because you &apos;re going to need it .  .  .  where are the stones ? 
i remember you now .  . the so called art dealer . 
zorg .  jean - baptiste emmanuel zorg .  .  .  nice to see you again
i &apos;m fucked ! 
 .  .  . we &apos;re saved ! 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying . 
and you don &apos;t know how they open ,  is that what you are saying ? 
yes ,  of course ,  but .  .  .  the stones are shut !  they have to be open for it to work . 
there &apos;s no light !  you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light . 
theoretically ,  yes !  the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there ,  but .  .  .  i don &apos;t have the reference book .  i &apos;ve never seen the stones work ! 
don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t know how all this works ? 
uh .  .  have you tried the diva &apos;s suite ? 
when is she not in trouble ? 
leeloo &apos;s in trouble ? 
yeah ,  i know .  .  .  to save the world .  .  .  but right now all i want to do is save leeloo . 
you &apos;re probably very angry with me and i quite understand .  but i want you to know i &apos;m fighting for a noble cause . 
trying to save your ass so you can save the world . 
what are you doing ? 
father ,  i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends .  so thanks for the offer .  .  but no thanks . 
of course . 
good luck .  . 
we have to save the world . 
what kind of mission ? 
we &apos;re not going on vacation .  . we &apos;re on a mission .  . 
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ? 
i &apos;m sorry to have to resort to such methods ,  but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston . 
that &apos;s what i thought . 
it means ,   &quot; never without my permission &quot;  . 
excuse me !  just one thing !   she said something to me a while ago and .  .  .  i don &apos;t really get it .  .  .  akta gamat ? 
i know .  i was there when she arrived . 
she &apos;s fine ,  really .  . don &apos;t you worry .  .  just needs some rest .  . she &apos;s had a very long trip . 
i might call to check up on her ,  you know .  .  .  to see if she &apos;s better ? 
yes .  that &apos;s fine !  thank you very much .  a thousand times over ! 
dallas .  korben dallas . 
thank you so much for your help mr .  .  .  ? 
she &apos;s an exception .  . 
they all like this in your family ,  father ? 
uh yes ,  we &apos;re cousins .  . distant cousins .  . 
so you do know her . 
there &apos;s not a moment to lose !  wake her up ,  but be gentle about it !   this woman is mankind &apos;s most precious possession !  she is .  .  .  perfect ! 
you noticed .  .  . 
he &apos;s a she ! 
the girl ? 
i brought the girl remember ? 
who are you ? 
she dropped in on me .  .  .  holding this . 
that &apos;s me .   but i don &apos;t know who she is .  .  .  where did you find her ? 
she &apos;s not my bride ,  she &apos;s my fare .  she &apos;s looking for this vito cornelius .  according to the phone guide he lives here . 
weddings are one floor down .  congratulations . 
excuse me ,  i &apos;m looking for a priest . 
this is government business now .  you ought to go home and get some rest ,  father . 
what are we going to do ? 
thank you ,  mr .  president . 
did you see that .  . thing .  . swallow our battleship like a gum drop ?   you can &apos;t even tell me what it is !  i ask you for options you give me bullshit .  give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards . 
white turns to black .   light to dark .  life to death .   for all eternity . 
but what happens if instead of this .  .  .  ultimate warrior .  .  .  it is evil who stands here ? 
yes .  . thank god .  . 
is there anything that can stop it ? 
and then it will be too late .  the goal of evil is to wipe out life !  all forms of life .  for all eternity .  .  . life upsets it . 
and then ? 
we have forty - eight hours ,  the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions . 
that &apos;s exactly what we are going to try and do :  protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens !  general ?  you may fire when ready . 
time is of no importance ,  mr .  president .  only life is important . 
your theory is interesting father but i don &apos;t think we have time to go into it right now ! 
one more reason to shoot first eh ? 
imagine for a moment that this .  thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be ,  because it is the antithesis of all we are .  because it is evil .  .  total evil . 
later ,  david !  later !  there &apos;s not a minute to lose ! 
you &apos;re all safe .  thanks be to god ! 
it &apos;s all my fault .   i &apos;m the servant .  .  .  it &apos;s my mission !  here ! 
on the plane .  .  .  with mr .  dallas .  .  .  the real one . 
where &apos;s leeloo ? 
good work ,  my son .   now all we need is a way to get there . 
i got it !   everything  here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel .  .  .  and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel ! 
perfect . 
they really made her .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t know your size . 
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago .  . said he was an art dealer  .  .  .  asking all these questions about the sacred stones .  . at the time i didn &apos;t think anything of it .  .  what was his name ?  i &apos;m so bad with names .  .  . 
yes .  of course .  . 
uh father ,  i know she &apos;s been through a lot .  .  .  but the sacred stones .  . we don &apos;t have much time .  . 
learning our history !  the last 5000 years that she missed !  she &apos;s been out of circulation a while ,  you know . 
what &apos;s she doing ? 
absolutely sure there &apos;s the triple suns on her gloves ! 
father .   you sure she &apos;s the supreme being ? 
the supreme being ,  the fifth element is here ,  in our parish !  !  !  it &apos;s a miracle !  !  ! 
father ,  will you please explain what &apos;s going on ? 
i can &apos;t wear these clothes !  this calls for dignity !  i have to dress the part ! 
what is ? 
it &apos;s a miracle !  !  ! 
they are .  .  .  with me .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but .  .  .  the stones .  .  . 
i would like to have died in peace .  .  . 
listen ,  the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her  .  .  .  i never saw her again . 
i don &apos;t have time .  .  .  i need to know . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know !  we hardly know each other .  .  .  it takes time ! 
do you love her ? 
i &apos;ll help her ,  i promise ,  but i think you should tell me where the stones are ! 
she was taught to love the life of others .  .  .  but not her own .  you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live ! 
 .  .  . so cornelius was telling the truth ! 
yes ,  and more than that .  .  .  you must give her the stones ,  she &apos;s the only one who knows how to use them . 
leeloo .  .  .  is .  .  .  she &apos;s .  .  . 
the fifth element .  .  .  the supreme being .  .  .  your wife .  .  . 
who ? 
you &apos;re a good man .  .  .  she was right to have chosen you .  .  . 
leeloo .  . 
uh huh .  . and i don &apos;t suppose you got the name of this .  . perfect fare .  . 
5 &apos;7 &quot;  ,  green eyes .  .  .  long legs .  .  .  great skin .  .  .  perfect .  . 
so ,  just how big was this fare ?

mr .  president ,  let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh ,  who runs the center . 
an elephant couldn &apos;t crack it . 
this thing solid ? 
wonderful ! 
 .  .  . this is the crucial phase ,  the reconstruction of pigment .  cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react ,  to protect themselves .  that means growing skin .  clever ,  eh ? 
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector .  the cell is for lack of a better word .  .  .  perfect . 
is there any danger ?  some kind of virus ? 
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours ,  there are simply more of them tightly packed .  his knowledge is probably limitless .  . 
yes .  .  .  i can &apos;t wait to meet him . 
sounds like a freak of nature to me . 
this cell is like a huge library .  it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside .  almost like it was .  .  . engineered . 
talk english doc . 
it &apos;s not that easy .  . we &apos;ve never encountered anything like it before .  . you see normal human beings have 40 dna memo groums .  . which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself .  . this one has 200 , 000 . 
have you identified it ? 
actually only one cell survived .  . 
this is all that survived ? 
how much time is left ? 
they just landed in the desert . 
don &apos;t worry ,  sir .  i have the perfect one . 
i want your best man on this ! 
 .  .  . what do you mean ? 
the - stones weren &apos;t aboard the ship . 
and the stones ?   did you find them in the wreckage ?

i &apos;m about to ,  mr .  president . 
staedert ?   what &apos;s going on ?   did you destroy it ? 
gentlemen ? 
my philosophy mr .  president is shoot first ask questions later .  i don &apos;t like uninvited guests . 
recommendations . 
wait or act . 
options . 
not yet sir .  . the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger ! 
what you are saying is you don &apos;t know what this .  . thing .  . is . 
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet ,  all the calibers are overshot .  . we &apos;re hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging .  . 
i have to address the supreme council in 10 minutes .  just the facts ,  general . 
perfect ,  mr .  president . 
is that better ? 
i can hear you ,  mr .  president ,  but i can &apos;t see you  . 
staedert ,  do you read me ?

father .  .  it in the most extraordinary thing .  .  the greatest find in history .  . can you imagine the implications . 
amen .  . 
 &quot;  .  . in which all the history of the universe resides  .  . all the strength .  . all the hope .  . protect us from evil .  .  &quot; 
lord forgive me .  .  they already know too ,  much .  .

dispatch me another zfx200 immediately .  someone stole mine . 
yes ,  sir !

yes ,  mr .  zorg ,  i hear you perfectly !  so ,  how was the concert ? 
how &apos;s that ?  can you hear me better now ? 
 .  .  . i can &apos;t wait to be among you . 
the stones will be here .  i &apos;ll see to it personally ! 
fine ,  just fine !   i &apos;ll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now .   but it wasn &apos;t easy .  my costs have tripled . 
how &apos;s our deal coming along ? 
got it . 
do you have the picture now mr .  zorg ? 
really ?  maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last ! 
 .  .  . not far ,  now . 
no .  .  .  not at all .   where are you ? 
am i disturbing you ? 
i just talked to her . 
she died in her sleep three days ago .   it was in the paper .  .  . 
tom .  .  .  she &apos;s dead . 
she &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .   she &apos;s the only witness .

i don &apos;t know what to say
look where we are .   look at yourself .   you son of a bitch ,  you don &apos;t have any idea what you &apos;re putting me through .  .  . 
amy ,  i &apos;m not going to let anything happen to us . 
you should have . 
i was in hell .   if i called you .  .  .  if i heard your voice .  .  .  it would have been so easy for me to quit .  i couldn &apos;t do that .
