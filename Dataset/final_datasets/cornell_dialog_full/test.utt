Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
There.
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
do you listen to this crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Wow
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
It's more
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
Who is she?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
It's about time.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
You didn't
Are you following me?
What's this?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I thought you were above all that
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
No.
It's just something I had.  You know
That ' s completely adorable!
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
I could be gone for years.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
They took everything...
May I ask by whom?
All I have to do is call the guards.
What do you see?
Chief knows.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
God... That's in a week!
Esdras is a Jew.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
We're lost!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Back in the Czech Republic?
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you alright?
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Where is she?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Why not?
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Thank you.
Okay.  You ready?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is that?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
You've got a call.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
What??
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Get outta here!
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Okay. 
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
You're kidding.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Fortunately, they did.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
That's true
I want to drive awhile.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You lying son of a bitch...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
No way to start a partnership.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Hey, this works pretty good.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Hey, you wanna bet?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
We split 50-50?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Where's luther?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
That was quick.
It's late, they're closing...
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Bullshit red tape.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Keep stallin'.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
They all like this in your family, father?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
It's a miracle!!!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh... at least fifty.
...What's your name?
You know how to fly this thing?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
I'm not going.
Finished what?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
...Like love...
Tell me...
Not going to open?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
I want your best man on this!
Staedert, do you read me?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Welcome home.
Your clothing reeks of it.
I'm not accusing you...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Tom...
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Alright, Tom.
I figured you share information.
Yeah, who's this?
I'm gonna kill you.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
You're making me very angry.
Remember me?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much do you make now?
How old are you?
A daughter.
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Uh huh, pleasure.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Yes... I remember Mary
What is this?
Okay, I'll take it all.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
We'll figure it out.
I'm sure they're around.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
What's wrong with me?
What?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Mommy...?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
There you go.  Love you.
You disappointed in me?
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
He sure loves to stay awake.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
They think I'm nuts.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
I think you're right.
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Are you alright, Wade?
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You see it?
We bought you.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Saw him do it?
Pop?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
That's illegal, you know.
Huh?
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
The key, Wade.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
See. Get your boots.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Strange.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
You're not using it today?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
Take care, Wade.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
We've already been inspected.
Who did this?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
Did they say anything about my family?
What's going on?
One.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Yeah, right.
You wanna knock of f?
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Shepherd.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
IT'S OPEN!
What's the story?
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
Elaine.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
What are you doing, Ted?
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
What will happen to him, Ted?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, what's happening?!
Can't we change course?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Request; life support systems check.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Surely you can't be serious.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
No. No one that I know of.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Ted, what are you doing here?
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Ted...
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Good-bye, darling.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
You are Cassandra?
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Why did you do it?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Please, I must get out here.
How potent?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
No!  We must do this alone.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Can't lock up...
Okay, let's do it.
Have they located my daughter yet?
I get the picture.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's the question?
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's game time.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
How do you know?
Oh - excuse me!
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Wolfi!
There's a young girl to see you.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Yes, my love?
You're not going to do this?
Frau Mozart?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Where's our friend?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Be careful!
Upstairs.
What a strange young man.
Really?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Why so?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, sir.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Yes.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
What medicine?
Well?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
Yes.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
I'm sorry. No.
Mio caro Adone.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
I can't say. Really
But what is it they don't like?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
A Mass for the dead.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
You mean she's not coming back?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Would you? Actually, you could.
The Fire.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
Exactly. A dance.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Leave me alone.
Well?
Do you hear me?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
I'll call tomorrow.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
I was. What are you reading?
How old are you?
How old are you?
I'm twenty-seven.
Alex?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
But, David.
The next corner we can get a cab.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Who is this girl?
Some, everyone does.
You're in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
It's moving.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
You're not real.
A monster. I know, I know.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
No, thank you, Doctor.
What here?
Then you have some hot tea?
Sorry.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
He has?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
Me?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Oh!
Yes?
It's all right. Thanks.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
The lobby's half filled now.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hello, Helen!
Why?
Yes.
No.
In Cluett's office?
What's keeping you?
What time was it?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Uhh, yeah it does.
This is the best score yet.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
I ain't done --
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Damn!
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
Still smells fishy.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Where the hell were you?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
This has been a good year.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
Jesse, is that your hand?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Let the law --
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
And you're too young.
I like that.
Not at all.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
That.
I want them arrested and hanged!
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
This is Dorsia?
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He's good-looking.
I want a firm commitment.
You're really serious, aren't you?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Are you my two o'clock?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
I'll do it.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Forget it.
Jean? What?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Just...say...no!
So, what do you do?
Welt...it depends, why?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Oh no, I'm okay.
How old are you?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Actually, yes.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I mean they want to get caught.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, I could he wrong.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You think so?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That took some fun out of --
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
...wanna savor this.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
What?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Milo? I'm Danny.
Who's that?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
'Think I should buy some originals?
How's it going?
It's okay. Really.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Did you?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
You could've handwritten it.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Did I say something?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
I told Teddy about you.
Thank God.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What're they building?
What is it?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Come in.
Thank you.
Yes?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
What do we do now?
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Shut up.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
What is it now?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Would that I could say the Same.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
What are you trying to do to me?
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I thought we were on our way.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Because you always obey orders ...
But you did suspect me.
Aren't you coming?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
I'll be back ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Where's Mother?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
This man -- did you see him?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
In your operation.
Are you alright, young man?
You with Mother or Father?
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Man, you're losing your audience.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
I don't believe you.
Let's go.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
That's it, prick lips.
Give him the works.
What can I be doing for you?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Is that all the coke in the place?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Oops!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Ed... you're kinky!
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Under the table!
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
-- He killed people --
People actually used to pay you for this?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Ya love it, probie?
Hey.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Anything else?
You're back.
Huh.
Arson.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
What is --
I'll see ya around, huh?
Oh Jesus Christ...
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Read.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did I say thanks?
Your brother was a good man.
Brian?
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Completely out of control.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Firehouse.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Look, I'm sorry I --
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Who's this?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
You took the chalice.
I forgive you.
Large?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
Let's go niggers!
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
You don't have the demographics.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
I'm out.
De-la-croix.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
I'm feelin' dis'!
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
I love you too, Daddy.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
What point is that?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
This is the group I was telling you about.
We both lied to him.
Who's side are you on?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Hi, Mona.
So they can be on TV.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Peerless, your father called.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
I never had a really real pair before.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
...not that time...
Around...
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
What else?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Then you yield to me.
No.
Will we always leave it at this?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Was he cheated?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Did -- did you --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
Yeah, right...
You saved Kendall's life --
What about the phosphorous grenade?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Whose blood is that, Jay?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
What happened to "degrees"?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
How are you?
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
I'm sorry, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
Something like that. You?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
I didn't shoot West...
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
You wanted to break him.
What if I don't want it?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We should tell him we're not going.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He said what?
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
I used it to start the fire --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
You want Kendall, don't you?
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Someone stole my backpack.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
Yeah.
How old are you?
In so many words, yes.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You don't like it?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
The river.
It's unbelievable.
I was drying out.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Oh. Oh.
How did you know my father?
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
You first.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
I need to know who you are first please.
I...
Binoculars.
Tell me what he said.
What did he say? Tell me!
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
They go.
I don't want to know.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
I don't hate you.
And who says what is wrong.
I don't have nothing.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Okay. Goodbye.
Lazarus?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Angela?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
What do you need?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Hi.
For your hands?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
You gonna steal my truck?
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Could you do somethin' for me?
You need some weed?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Then what?
So...  That your first time?
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
What happened to your face?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I think she got to you, pappy.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
What's this?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Who do you think the Jap is?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Squid?
All right, how's the new partner?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Nick!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
I've continued working on the case!
What's he saying?
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
You can't come in.  They don't want --
I'm not drunk...
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
No...
Start it.
I'm sorry.
What's that for?
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Where's the wife?
Keep the change.
This is my stop.
Dope?
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
I want a gun.
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Six, huh?
Yeah.
You equipped for random questions?
Yes?
Those cockroaches?
How long you had these guys?
One more, eh?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
During the road test...
But you haven't put in for emigration.
How do you mean 'exploited'?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Me.
It's artificial?
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
In your opinion.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Where is he?
Did you cry when your father died?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
They could clean around the arrangement.
Ten years.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
But I understand what you mean.
How come you were in my truck?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
You're kidding!
Your mom was a dancer?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
No, I'm lost.
Dickhead?
Do you own a car?
Nope.
Over this?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Why not go to work for me?
Who are these people?
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
This is for me.
Yes.
Because I want to get married.
They're all divorced?
I was wrong!!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
All right.
The what?
About clothing?
I thought I was here to meet women.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
There.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
My pleasure.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
The hotel.
The sky?  Where?
Sure.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Yes?
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Well, where are you --
Oh, my God!
You got a light, honey?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
No.  They all do.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
If we still have one.
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Should we say a little prayer first?
We stay down here.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
How long will you set it for this time?
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I don't know.
Um... Eve?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, no!
We came back to the house!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Adam!!
Buy it from me?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Are you Detective Williams?
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Who knows you have these?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Not yet.
Yes? What is it?
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Yes.
Then don't talk about killing.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Nice guy. Who's he?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
What?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Hello?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
You really want to do this, don't you?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
Look Jeffrey.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Are ya ready?
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Mother, is that you?
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Oh, we're good man.
Who did you kill?
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
The what man?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Fuck you!
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
I guess not.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
When'd he tell you?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Our money situation is not good.
We've got sixteen dollars.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Dignan. Take it easy.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
What are you doing?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
What'd he get?
Why?
Where?
Does it float?
Exactly. Woah.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Let them fight.
Jesus, Bob.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
That's Anthony.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
You stole a Trans-Am.
What was that all about?
Where'd she go?
I paid for it.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
This is natural.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Not in that car you're not.
I know it's not.
Yes, I do.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Do you have your own cell?
Do they let you --
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
Is he in?
I don't know.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Berlin!
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Show me again...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You know I'm not.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
So why didn't you kill me then?
Try again.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
I know it's a dream.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
See that tram coming around the corner?
It's me.
Oh, shit...
Looks like he's been detained.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Show me.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
Yes. In that order.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He won't come.
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Stephen ready?
You know it's a trap.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
Good to see you again.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I do not confess.
I'm not just saying it!
I need you so much! I love you!
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
We're gonna be late again.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
I found these. The others are still in storage.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Where are you now?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
I know, but...
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
It didn't feel like a dream.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I couldn't cut the rope.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
And you want to know --
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
What do you want for Sam?
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Yes?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
And then?
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Did he give any reason?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Good morning.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Yes.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
What else, my dear Major?
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
Manages what?
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Yeah, you were saying?
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
You're late.
Sam's piano.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Boss!
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Thirsty.
No.
No.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
You know what happened to this?
Four four.  A record.
I can't even keep fish alive.
I have to.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I would never --
This is so unfair.
What will you do?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Which I didn't have.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
You what?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
Hello.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I've never seen a lobster.
Oh...
I better go.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
And what did she die of, exactly?
What's the *medical* explanation?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Is *your* father dead?
What's a nanny do?
What's an immigrant?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Liberator...
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
It's almost like flying.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
I don't think so.
I thought it was my turn.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
Rose Rose?
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
*What* view?
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keeping the Fix happy.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Ten is standard, sir.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
I'm going home
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
She up for this?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Calls?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Excuse me?
Attractive girl.
That's not --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
And some new clothes.
I gotta go get a haircut.
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
He was looking out for you.
Your mess.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Pretty much.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Can't say.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
So what do you want?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Did he buy it?
You guys awake?
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
It's just insurance.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I found her in bed with someone.
Last hand.
Good night?
And your lady?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
Where did you get it?
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
That girl, she works at the casino --
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Nothing about you.
Here...use a spoon.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
Toss you for it.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
And I thought you were only after my body.
But if it does.
Yes.
I don't think we should meet again.
How are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
What are you, a cop?
Does Bella come here?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
The key!
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is the key?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hey, bomb...
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
It is intuitively obvious.
Exactly.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Veil nebula.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
I need a diameter approximation.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
We're running out of time, sir.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Can I say something in my defense?
How're ya doin', Max.
What is it?
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What a creep.
Thank God.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Who is...
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Sorry about your window.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
What's in it for you?
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
I think you should go now.
Say the words, "I understand."
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Morning, Sunshine...
Unlikely.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
And why should she?
I want you on call here.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What are you, high?
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
I think we should try sneaking in.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Ahh, sunshine.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Is that your final answer?
I feel bad for his family.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
When can I squeeze one out?
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Dea ex machina...
Who is... we?
What happened to your eye?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
Grandma Death.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Don't you watch the news?
Follow him where?
Do you think a lot about girls?
How are things going at school?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
I think now that he might...
Then how is time travel possible?
When will this happen?
I can see him right now!
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Chut up!
There's no rule!
Wicked.
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Mrs. Leeman?
Ow!
C'mere. I love you so much.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
What?
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Father...
Who to?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Yes -- why?
Hey you!!
Half watch dog?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
No, but I shot some ducks.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Are you getting tired?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Then it's war?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Oh, Rufus!
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Uncle, you can't do this!
One or two?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Oh yes?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
...everyone has been very kind.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Tell me about it, please!
Is he... dying then?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Hello...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
...my... home?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
What's the matter?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
Do you believe I love you?
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
No.
I'll tell you what...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Why should you care?
It's Halfdan the Black!
What?
You talking piffle, son?
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
There is another way.
What do you think?
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
Look, I bagged it last week.
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Get away, Snorri.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
My brother blacksmiths!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I must KILL! Kill!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And something to sharpen them with?
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Take care.
You like that?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Let me drive you home.
Let's talk about it later.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
More?
Such a beautiful view.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What if you hide me?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Do you remember what we talked about?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Probably.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
I wish we did. You married?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
I probably got the same thing as you.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
I should maybe talk to you.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
It's stopped.
No way. I can handle this.
Oh.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Does that help?
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
What's your bartlett's?
But I don't know how to polka.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Is everything getting worse?
You don't?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
What are you doing?
You're the best?
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Time to play Spam in the can.
From what?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
Is that an offer?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
Does he know that?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Patch me through to him.
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
Any survivors?
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
What are you?
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Captain Miller...
Sir.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
Maybe one of the original crew?
Who?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Miller, come in...
I'm on my way, Starck.
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
You got any coffee?
Where is she?
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
What is it?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
What did you wish for, honey?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
I had it at four.
How long was I out?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Ben --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Where... where am I?
Hey! That's a prototype!
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
And where do we think we're going?
He's not responsive --
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Feeling better?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Ben did this?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Something happened to them, mon.
I can't find it, mon!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Is everything okay at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Leave me alone.
You're a really good kisser.
Take that back.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
It's definitely your mama.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
Seen the new Playboy?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
How's it going.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
You'll always remember your first time.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
How long does Doug take?
It couldn't be.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I want romance.
Sometime?
But what are you going to do?
You just ripped my card in two!
I couldn't make it in time.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
What's that?
Well, you'll find out next year.
If you graduate.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
I think I better take you home.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Aren't your parents asleep?
Where's your brother?
...I've got to go home.
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Naked!?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Oh, my God!...
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
That's good...
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
Can we make it?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Jesus.
The cops?
WELL? What are your plans?
NO! Stop talking like that.
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
May I see your license.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
We just smeared a skunk.
Ohhh.
Your parents of relation?
I'm in.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
How much you got to see the show?
Will these boards hold?
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
What?!
Yeah, maybe.
Let's go!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
What did we say about lying?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Excuse me, sir?
Hi Frances, got a minute?
You know what I mean.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
...So what do you think?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Whattaya mean?
You don't know what you want.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
What a man!
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
You give up on her?
And no people.
Yeah.
I'm not!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Don't... talk crazy.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Where are you going?
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
I don't believe so.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Is there something else?
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
You're an outcast.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Must've been a terrible row.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
You make me weak.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Professor?
Are you having me on?
Do you really think I'm mad?
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Now you've got him started.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
Ah. An explorer.
Do you share my madness?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
We should go now.
It still hurts?
Trouble?
Where?
You know what I said, though.
Claudette...
What the hell?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Roll him over!
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
I love you.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
You okay?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Anything else you want?
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
What are you gonna do?
You don't believe in suicide.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Not a chance.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Who's this?
Where is the little lady?
Is this real?
Was? As in not anymore?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Why not, against your religion?
Now, is your shit together?
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
It's the bitterest of pills.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
What did I say?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
I'm really sorry.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I never said help us!
What the fuck was that about?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Richard!
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
How?
Of course, but there's more --
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Oh, really.
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
Then good night.
Ah, c'mon...
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Can't complain, ma'am.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
Then I suggest we start there.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
So why are you telling me this?
They're more afraid of you.
Who is it?
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
O'Neil?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
We're fucked.
Subject?
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
What?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Animal, I can't.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
What are you doing here?
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Merde!
And how should we do that, Sir?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
It's the French Secret Service.
I need you to trust me.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Hello?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Come on, old friend...
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
He wants to THINK!?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
I don't know.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Systems register functional.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Hey... Hey where are you going?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
How does the rolling help, actually?
You gotta admit, they do love him.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Wait. What did you say?
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
You... You mean Earth?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Mathesar? What is that?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
We've got powder but no ball!
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yessir.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Partially...
A grand scheme?
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
These supplies...?
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
To win this war I need an army.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
You hear that?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
You get the money?
Where is my nephew?
He's around someplace.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Get something going there.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
I'm working on a few things.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Ray Barboni?
Something shouldn't be there.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
You make movies, huh?
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
So he comes to L.A...
That's it? That's your movie?
For a movie?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Yeah, he told me.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
How? By taking my money?
We call you a taxi.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Rough day on the set?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
What? You sure?
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What is your first name?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Smokes?
Dodge.  Dodge.
Get up.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Can't you use something else?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I think you know.
What?!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
You mean, before she sank.
Coffee.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Go on.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
You just shoot at something?
He needs a doctor.
The ah... the radio's out.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
What do you think happened on this boat?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
What now?
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
What happened?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
You're kidding, right?
Will you get off my back for once?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
And what can you tell us about this... 
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
I...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
That guy rules!
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Oh, hi...
Hi Enid.
God, what a bunch of retards...
Shut up!
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
I might actually get the pasta special.
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
There's my dad with Joanie.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
I want to "make love" to him.
It's obviously him!
Are you sure?
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What? How long have you been standing there?
We still have to go in there sometime.
There he is...
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I'll bet he never jerks off...
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
What? When did you see Josh?!
Hello?
May I ask what you're doing?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Is this one any good?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Well are --
Yeah, sure... very funny....
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
What is that?
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Aren't you going to get that?
Uh... hello?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
What's up?
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
No... they said she was here...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know.
You were contracted to work-
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Pleasant journey?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Goddammit!
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Soon. 
He has children?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Everybody has a choice.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
That's quite a story.
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
What now, Brainiac?
So far so good.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
I'm Egon --
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Is the line sinking?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
That's too bad.
Damn!
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
I want to help you.
You're the best one in your row.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Do you want this body?
That is one speedy mutt.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Did you see it?  What was it?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
And may I see this storage facility?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Circle?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Something was definitely here.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
All right.  I'll try.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
Set entry grid.
I've got to sleep.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
What is it?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
How was your date?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
I am their hero!
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Take grain away from the army?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Where is my father?
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Will you take me home now?
I think I'd better go home now please.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
All right.
Yes.
What is it?
What?
But you're not enrolled.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Well, I want you to leave.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Are you going home?
Benjamin?
We just can.
You really will?
Ben!
What are you then?
Mrs. Robinson?
What?
Where is your luggage?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Is there an ashtray in here?
In general.
Will you take me home?
Will you come in, please?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Oh my God.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What?
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Hello, Benjamin.
May I have a drink?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Yes?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
You're not interested in art?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
What?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well I can't.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
At college.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
This is absurd.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I'm just --
I guess -- about my future.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
You miss the point.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
I don't believe it.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I have an idea working in my head... 
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Too bad.
That was lovely.
Going?
You live here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
And then --?
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I want to be alone --
And what do you do -- now?
You do believe that I really love you?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Bless you...
I can't.
I'm worried about you.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Any letters?
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
I must go to England -- at once.
Can you pay some attention to me?
Baron!
Oh, no.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
You see -- what we are interested in --
I can't dance tonight --
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Good morning, Pimenov.
You're discharged.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No. No word.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You want a drink?
You're a thousand percent right!
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Want a look?
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
What's up?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
What?
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Her job.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
You were gone for a while.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Carter.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
Where are you going?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
What?  Where is she?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
I can see that.  Why?
Then I'll get caught.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Keri, you all right?
Look, they're staring right at us.
What's this?
Shane's going as a condom.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
You've been watching too much TV.
Mommy!!!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
No!!!
Yes?
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Hm?
Home, sweet home.
Um.
Home.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Can I have the Cadillac?
What'll you do for transportation?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Okay.  Okay.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
You invited me.
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Excellent!
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
A hundred dollars!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
This is crazy.
What's that all about?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Harold!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Now that's what I call fun.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
Now--turn around, if you would.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Breakfast?
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
It couldn't!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
Honor, I suppose.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
How do I load?
Ooops.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
She's fine.  Please--
Will you please go?  An emergency!
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
No.  No.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Something's made you sore.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Don't touch me.
No.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
A what kind of doctor?
Not true.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Is he all right?
Did you talk to Paul?
What was it?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
You and Harold are friends?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
You've got to fight from time to time.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
No.
Just one.
We offer...
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
No.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You making a feature?
Where's he?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Is that the way it was with you?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
What the crap?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
She left you right?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Mast?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
They're legal now.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
I don't know.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
I don't know.
Jake'll take care of me.
Was he with a girl?
Yes.
Come again.
Could I see your registration?
Took it?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
What do you want?
A block of ice.
What do you see?
Eh, no. Thank you.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
You don't look eighty.
Why do you say that?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What?
What is it?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
I think he's following us.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Oh, you weren't scared.
- end where I began.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It looks like you. Thanks.
Supper for two.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
I feel giddy.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Mother.
Mother.
Do you play?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
None at all?
Your classmates?
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Well, I didn't.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
He... he loved me.
It's a beautiful dress...
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
I... I had a visitor.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I'm scared.
Where am I?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
He talked about Demons, huh?
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Where do you --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
But it's not true, is it?
Lucky man.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
You remember.
Oh my God.
Bastard.
Well can I come in or not?
Wedded bliss?
Help me.
No. God no.
What happened to you?
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Later.
You would be. They tore me apart.
Kirsty.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
How long since you were here?
He's here?
What's wrong?
Great.
...maybe we should never have come back.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
It's not what I heard.
Oh!
If I make it through the day.
Are you busy after work ?
What?
Do I know you?
Nice, Barry.
I wanna date a musician...
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
The little skate-fuckers.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Great.  Can I have it then?
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Right.  Why?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Huh?
Good weekend?
Let's not.
Shit!
Are you coming home?
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- Alright, alright but --
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
I suppose so.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Of course it is.
Hi.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Hello.
Are you alright?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Look, we can do other things.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
So?
Is Ray going?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
It's a great song.
Which way are you going?
Yeah?
So so.  Up and down.
Hello?  Anybody there?
I knew this was going to happen.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
No.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
He tried to kill me last night.
He sees me as a threat.
Is this what you killed them with?
When you finish, what then?
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
What is it like?  Being you?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
What is it?
All fashionably without heads.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Aye.
I was driven out.
How can you know this?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
You feel you know me.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
How can I stop such a man?
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
I'm your future husband, remember?
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
You're wrong.
Your name?
What is your position?
The last four.
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
And have you something to settle with me?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
I want you to come to me.
My condolences.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
Oh, it isn't like that.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Mother? But your mother --
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
What do you want?
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Allow me.
What now?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
What do you mean?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
Hello -- hello...
Ring that number, will you?
No, you don't! Walter!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Flip a coin.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
There's money in it, Cooley.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Open up there, will you!
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Come on with that money!
Here!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Hey --
Who? Me?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Pinkus.
Here's the picture of my wife.
The door was locked.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
You want to join our gang?
Do you know any swear words?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Wow!
It was great for me, how was it for you.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
How's your war, Mac?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
What are you going to be then?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Tiny's home.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
How much further?
He left!
Thank you.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
He walks, duh.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
But if you did.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Yeah.
Perfect.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
She looks like she stinks.
Fuck! We are fucked!
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Come on, get with the facts.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Goddamn.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Fuck your grandmother.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Rise and shine.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
Jesus Christ.
What'd ya got there?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Well hello, officer.
Get in... now!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
What about the body you found?
Plates match.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
I am sleepy.
What is it?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
No.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
I'm going to miss you.
I'll be in touch.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
You do?
What are you doing in there?
Flares?
Did you see that?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's perfect!
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
How's work?
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
Interesting.
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
I want to talk to you.
To win.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Pool.
Character.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
That's your problem.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
What's the matter? What happened?
They're fine.
I got time, Bert.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Well... well, now.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Findley.
That's right. When?
Gimme ten bucks.
Long wait for a bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Why did you do that?
Where you been all day?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You got it all in your head?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
What happened?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You need the words?
What is it, Eddie?
What do you want to tell me?
A week? A year?
Fifty-seven.
Go on back to the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Your shot.
You name it.
I only protect myself -- !
Mine.
Yes.
You want me to stay?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Why, Dad?
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you all right, Dad?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
It was so real, Dad.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
Is that all he said?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
We were having a little talk.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
Mr. Gardner, I --
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Why?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
When?
David? How'd you get this number?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
We're losing them.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Spunky?
Perfect, she's using it.
You punched the President in the face?
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
That's impossible...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
With their shields down it might be possible.
It's doing what?
He's trying to impress you.
You can't go. Call them back.
Be careful.
So, what do you do for a living?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Stop it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
How' he doing?
What the hell's going on?
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
My reputation precedes me.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus!
Henry, the pen --
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Tapestries?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
Bingo.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
What are you going to do?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
No! Don't Shoot!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
My Diary's in Berlin.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
All right! Where's my father
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
What does it mean, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
You all right?
What'd he say?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
He's afraid of something.
Not leftovers?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
A fulcrum release lever!
I want to go home...
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I said something.
You've heard of the PEM114...
I know...it sounds insane.
Are you crazy?
What was that?
I want out.
Did you hear that?
That's not a good idea.
You need ID in there?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
What do we do?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
What do I do?
What happened?
Without your pants.
Yeah. I did it.
Now, where would I be?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Even Rene?
You're doing great with her.
And on my time.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
Where are you going?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
One of your instincts?
...drink it.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
I have been... I think you're right.
She works for them.
She is beautiful.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Sorry...
I didn't do anything.
Impossible.
Me.
You've cut your hair?
Who is your friend?
Yes?
Al Viola.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Sue who?
What did you say?
What do you do about what?
The poet...something he said...
Blake said that?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
Why did you leave?
Why?
He didn't.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
Where we going?
That must be him. Water taxi.
Why'd you ask him.
Chiang Cho?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
So do I.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Are you alright?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Ow?...
It will.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What's new?
We gotta hook up.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Are you all right?
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
And what are you implying?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Hey, Lowell.
Right now?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
What?!
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Yeah.
How have you liked your stay?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Yes.
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
You greased the rails!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Poor communication skills.
Object to the form of the question!
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
I'd just like to have a word with her.
You're in a rush.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
That's his lawyer.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
What the hell is Botox?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
What?
I'm happy for you, pal.
I have it.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Who was that?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
What is your husband's profession?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
No.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Hello?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
But?
Honey, I could sit...
Good.  Are those foods?
You don't like me?
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Income tax evasion?
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Is this Ming?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
What do you think?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What's this about not eating?
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Oh, come now
Why; naturally, I
What would you like to have me do?
All right, let it go.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, yeah?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
What am I going to do now?
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Your ego is colossal.
Here
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Nope. No complaints.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
This looks like the best spot.
Thought you were hungry!
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
Here comes a car!
Any luck?
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
You bet we did.
What's up?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Mush. Mush.
Mebbe.
Wife?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Street cats?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
You know you keep saying that.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
...give me protection?
What do you mean?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Then who killed the President?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Daddy!  Where have you been?
I'm scared.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Aren't you being a little hard?
No.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Please answer the question.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Honey, you all right? 
Hi.
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
And if you're wrong?
They killed him, honey.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
I know David - a strange character.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Can we find her?
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Jim Garrison?
Well, thanks for coming.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
And he never hit you before?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
This looks pretty good on me.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
My ass ain't the same.
Why?
How old's Annette?
You think he's got a thing for you?
You know some interesting people.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
You're rationalizing.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
He's already there.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Wanna go?
Who's side are you on?
Yes'm.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I'm recording this.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Where's the bag she gave you?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Oh, hi.
Sure.
How long you been with Ordell?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
Yeah?
I got a problem...
The Cockatoo Inn.
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
I was there, I saw her do it.
What does she think she's gettin?
It's boring, isn't it?
I thought you were sixteen.
Wanna fuck?
I'm carrying it.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
I'm going to wait in the car.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
How much is there?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Couldn't talk to her?
Where did you shoot her?
Louis?
What'd you shoot her with?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
What's his full name?
House or apartment?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
She was afraid.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Get me out of here.
Dream on!
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
It's cold.
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
You think they're connected?
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Louis, you're a life saver.
No.  I see them.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
My back. I can't move. I need my chiropractor.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Where are you?
The room!
Who? Jed?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
What do you mean you can see?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
How high is that?
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
I know.
While you were in the shower.
He said you didn't have one.
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Who was that?
How?
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Oh?  Where you going?
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
We're doing everything we can.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
I have some ice from the machine.
On top of him?
He's not part of the program.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
His mother?
Minimal.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Uh-oh.
Creepy.
It bought us some time.
You're a teacher.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Wait a minute...I need...
Yllo, what's your head count?
I'm with you kid.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Where are you going?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
We're screwed!
See? We're not so bad.
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Now that's just gross.
I'm missing two!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
This is what it means right here.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You're quicker than usual.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
I don't know...sorry?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
My cars. And a comic book.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Colorful, isn't he?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Now tell me something I don't know.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Who's that young man?
She's right.
What? What?!
He ate a car?
...Nothing.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I hope we get some more help.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
What day is this?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
Look at him take it!
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
What can that gun of yours do?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
We're getting a stretch limo.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Can we make out now?
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
What is your job title, exactly?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Wow, dream big!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Viscera?
Yeah.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
We definitely want it to have junk.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
The Wizard of Gore?
Cool.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Is the baby okay?
No...
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
A hotel?
You lose!
Hi, I'm Adele.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Happy birthday Adele.
Shush, Adele.
...I don't know.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sure.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
So tell me... what happened here?
I like that.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Early, just think...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
...You know what I mean?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Shit.
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Shit.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Probably.
Telly.
Why?
It is right.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Where you at?
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Do you like kissing me?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Telly is at Steven's?
Sorry.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Telly says was up.
Did you bleed?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
I hate sucking dick!
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
What happened?
Do you know where he went?
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
Mom.
You want a wip-it?
Where does everyone sleep?
It was... it was.
What do you mean, no?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
The door was open.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
No.
Then let's narrow it down.
You're a lying bastard!
What are you talking about?
What is it?
Just like who?
What?
What makes you think I was there?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
Nope.  Nothing.
You might not have done it had you known.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
You mean, no prints but hers?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
Kathy?
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
That's it?
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Then I'll transpose.
It's a good play, but risky.
You're always in the middle of a match.
I can check and call you back.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Is this your first time here?
Are you with the tournament?
Sounds very violent.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
What are you looking for?
They couldn't break the riddle.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
In a way.
Of course.
Alright.  What about me?
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
You.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
You're going to be late for your match.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
In the Arctic ice.
The White Castle has fallen.
The new Queen lives.
From here, I must go alone.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I can. Because I choose it.
My <u>friend</u>.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
I'm hungry.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
Oh, my poor stew!
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
They'll trample him to death!
Freylag's stronghold?
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
A fine match.
It is the time.
She has the power of vision.
I was beautiful then.
Knowledge.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Why can't I have a bank account?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
May I go to the cinema?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
You say it just to calm me!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
So what's the deal Maurice?
Anything?
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
I do love you... very, very much.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
To where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
What's his story?
Shit!  He jumped!
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
This story is big huh?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Are you firing me?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Come on Mr. Parker.
I don't have kids.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
I really want that watch.
Hello!
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
What do you mean?
Me neither.
Sera you are crazy.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
You have been lonely?
I loved him!
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Why the hell not?
What did you see when you entered the house?
I'm sorry?
-- his life?
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
How'd it go at the trial?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
Picking out my wedding dress!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Oh, my God!
Someone missed you.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
Pink ones.
She's naked.
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
There he is!
Fool's magic.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
The princess is dead.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Shhhh!
Beware.
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Is she... dead?
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
There isn't much time!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
We seek to undo the curse.
But you did... you did!
Liar!
What shall we do?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
Tis the truth.
Tis not fit for a princess.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Biting you?
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
That was in jest.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
What's she doing?
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Simple as that, eh?
And video games after!
I put him to work.
Why?  What do you mean?
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
I don't know.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
You hate your father.
Why is that?
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
I have the permit.
That would take weeks.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
I've been here twenty years.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
I didn't recognize you!
Thanks for the shower.
Hello?
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Where are you going?
Where is it?
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
I aimed high.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
God, you look like crap, George.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
What?
Four days.  I left to think.
I was parked in day parking.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
One of you would end up dead.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Hey, hey!
George --
What is it?
Oh...with his ear infection!
It's been a while.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I'm married.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
To shave your chest?
I was talking about our marriage.
Where are the kids?
No.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
No, nigger.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
I got it... boss.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Don't I know you?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
I said you're soft.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Reward?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
What's up, Ray?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
Back to New York for starters.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
What'd you say?
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
You ever done time before?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
What is that?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
They gave me life, mama.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
What's your name?
Where'd you get this?
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
What is it?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I mean... tough break.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Hey.
Thanks.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Schnapps...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Hello.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Off limits.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
What's going on, Logan?!
What's wrong, Available?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
I'm listening.
I'm not armed.  Well?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Maybe... sure...
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why tell me?
Uh-uh.
I -- I can't.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
How do we know this is the right way?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't ever let go.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
What kind of jewel is this?
I'll make the arrangements.
Come with us.
How long have you been living here?
Where are they?
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
What's happenin'?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Hi.
I don't know.
What deal?
Pornos.
So, should I call Andy?
Alice...
Where's the bathroom?
What night is that?
Hey.
The police called us.
Repeat that, Bill.
You just gonna let him go?
Do you remember?
He's not Madison?
There's no other bedroom?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
Good book, huh?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
The heart, I guess.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
No. No, I don't.
Why haven't you called me?
Last time I saw you.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
Two years!?
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Yes.
Yeah. You know.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Hey - look!
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
buy and sell?
Very often.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What is it?
I don't know.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
The clothes?
Where did you come from?
Where were you hiding?
I guess we're in for it.
What do you suggest?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
You think we're nuts.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
We'll take it from here.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
What's going on, Kay?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
After I got the shit beat out of me!
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
Found it.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
Agatha --
Agatha...
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
And replace them with new ones.
That's not much.
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Victim's a white female.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
You can't run --
John --
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Confirm with trig and image.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Just go to the beginning!
Sean -- you're not real.
It's a little late for that.
Oh, Sean --
Who are you?
Let go of the gun.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Where?
How do I even know which one has it?
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
The guy from USA Today is here.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
There a maid in this hotel?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
He looks familiar.
I like it.
What was it then?
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Yeah.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Are you sure?
All the suites are about the same.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
Uncle Bobby?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Get your hands off of her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Well, you look it. You win?
What's your record at?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
How bad is it?
You like the ponies?
A million. Easy.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
There won't be a next thing.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
What's the plan?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Spa?
What about it?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
How am I being shitty?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
He implied it.
Sorry coach.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
How'd you unlock my phone?
I don't know.
Who you calling?
What are you doing?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
How'd they know who you were?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Yeah.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You fucking nuts?
We're not getting whacked.
Put that shit out...
Let's check out the penguins.
I'm pretty sure we do.
What about it?
No. I'll wait here.
Where's the surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Cardiff Giant?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
You look good, man.
Yes.
How do you know it's not drugs?
You strapped?
It means you got a gun?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Coke?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
So whenever we want...
Yes. You're going to New York.
I get it.
No. I'll take a strega.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Edinburgh.
Keeps me out of the army.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
How's it feel?
It hit?
I'll give you back the 600.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Make it plain.
Could we sit down someplace?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Brother Earl.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I assumed...
If you want to tell me.
Did you see the papers today?
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
Get out.
You the man.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Who pays you?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Do you know who I am?]
How does it affect you?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
The blocks.
Could I ask you a question?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Jordan!
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Creasy.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I'll call her up.
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Who you gonna call?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
We got to stop them right here.
You got directions?
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
When will he be able to write?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
Any time. Whenever we want.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Is that liquor?
You betcher ass, Dad.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Is he out?
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
How did you get called that?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
The blonde dish.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
What's wrong with you?
Can you make out what they're talking about?
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yes!
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
I can read. I can read!
That's our man. He's made to order.
Okay, fellows.
Colonel!
Have you seen him?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
What do they want?
No!
It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Well, I don't get it.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Tell me what's wrong.
Who are you again?
Anything on Korda so far?
Satisfied?
How did you like Toronto?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I'm just practicing my lying.
They need to run first and second?
We won!
You're crazy.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
How many have you lost?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
There is?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Hmm?
Scott...
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I can't do that.
This is Halden.
They have nothing to do with this --
Do you believe in miracles?
The guests are here.
You are not a God.
The new world.
You were the one who was dying.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
The maze has been changed --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
What is it?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
An interface attendant.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Don't know what you're talking about.
It was just there.
Standard, modern, upscale --
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
I heard that!
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NEW POWER COINS!!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
... Not bad.
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we do that?
... A falcon?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
Simon says...
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
Anybody see them?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Life knocked me back.
When my money moves, I go with it.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Same here.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Charlie!
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You're getting' 10 cc's
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
This business is about taking risks.
What the fuck does that mean?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Where's the stiff?
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
What a cozy little scene.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
At the moment, yes.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Bitchin' good cake.
Sure. Why?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
Can't you give it to me later?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Stu...LOOK!
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Is there something else I can do for you?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
But I was dusting.
What's wrong?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Where to?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
What's this, Diz?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Did you like the first act?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Why do I always laugh at that?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
What!
Taylor, my dear.
Dinner, Hubert.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
All right, why?
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Will the Senator yield?
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Y-yes.
Please, sir!--come with me!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Oh, now--
Just fine.
What's your name?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Pardon?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Where do we go from here?
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
You want to see me, Senator?
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
What do you want, Senator?
Well--me, too!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
How nice.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Were you present when all these things took place?
You are , aren't you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Tell me more about yourself.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
What did you mean by that?
Oh, I don't know.
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Mary, I'm going home.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Hello, Mary?
You're a fool, Babe.
You're acting like a school girl.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Did it?
How'd you get the picture?
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
You try it.
Gold, eh?
Fourteen carat?
I wish you luck, sir.
Come on, John. What happened?
Yes. That is to say
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
I'm Chairman?
We provide opera.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Yes, sir.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Please!
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
What an asshole!
What's that?
I was... never satisfied.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
What brought this on?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
What do you want to know?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
What it might take is... doing time.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
But you know how to drive?
Got a license?  But no car?
How are you?
Mom's such a cutie.
You're doing great.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Is that when you split up?
And he's where?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Sofie...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
This is great!
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
I guess that makes sense.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
And what ritual would that be?
Altar boys?
Let's make us even, shall we?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Where's your new friend?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Two hundred pounds.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Yeah, I was there.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
You two!
Something like that.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I'm not?
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
I'm staying.
You lied to me!
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
It must have slipped my mind.
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
He was the last time I saw him.
Much less go outside.
Sounds good to me.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Have you considered my offer?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
And the light goes out...
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
The Obliterators!
Wow.
I use it... to fight evil.
It is?
You did?
This is bad.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
And who is defending Paris?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
And he sent you to me?
Does your mother know you have come?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Only Lisette?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
She must have been in love with you.
But you will not... be safe...
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
What did you say his name was?
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
Why?
I walked.
You see that?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
You alright?
What's the matter?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
What is it?
Today ain't my day.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Hey.
What?!  What that mean?
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where's Craig?
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
You too big.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
'Take your car?'
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Huh?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
All right, I'll do it.
Somebody close?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
For what?
Good luck.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
What would you do in my place?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Can we go now?
I have to do something.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Keep the change.
Well?
What are you going to do!?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
Fuckin' A.
And what happens if I don't call you?
Any trouble?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Where's your Mom?
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
I'll light the lamp.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Plan on a longer visit next time.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
What can we do, Mother?
Twenty-five wives!
What could have possessed that girl!
Why?
To see Dad?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Where are we goin', John?
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
John, where's your folks?
Where ye from?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
All right...  Come along.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Now: Where?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
What's their names?
The first night?
Get up, Willa.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Are you through praying?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What's wrong, John?
What are you after them for?
I been bad!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
You okay?
You believe in anything?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
The killer.
How you plan to do that?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
What?
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Go even crazier?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
When did you have a nightmare?
Well, here are fifty francs.
Bring me forty-five back.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
No, that's not him...
That's her.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Capitalistic methods...
Misha! Misha!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
What a lovely room you have here.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
We can wait.
Yes, Leon...
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
How much does this cost?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Allow me, Comrade.
What's that?
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
...and Kopalski.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
On what?
At what intervals does he whistle?
Thank you.
Yes, it is.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Is that customary?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Do you hear that?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Glorious, analytical...
I must go.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Room service speaking.
I always eat here.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Would that make you any happier?
Make it ice cold.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Thank you.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
All right, I'll listen.
Hello, Leon darling!
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
Where are they?
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
How much do you need?
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
I agree it's ridiculous but --
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
I understand that, sir.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
I don't have a pistol.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Mr. President!
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
I can't ...
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
... little Bobby.
You'll win the nomination.
Who do you think is behind it?
Why, you got a customer?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
... give me a break, Mary.
... Use his women.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
So I'm supposed to be ...
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Were you planning to tell me?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Are you okay?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
And what am I doing?
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
How fresh is this coffee?
That man that shot you died in prison.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
Nineteen zero and nine.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No money in his room there?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
But you don't believe it.
...Now that's aggravating.
Yessir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
...This month's checks.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...How'd you sleep?
No.
I need to know that.
What're you doin', baby?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
Did you go up to his trailer?
...You getting anything on this?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
You on all night?
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
What do you want to know?
You tell me the option.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
It's called a transponder.
Took me about three hours.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
Junior year!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Need something else?
You must be joking.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Lyla's very nice.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Of course.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
You're in serious danger!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I left my husband two days ago.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Doctor David Ravell.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Looking for someone?
Rosa, so you've met David?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Could you give us an example?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
I hope you're right...
Joyce was screwing Del.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
What?
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
What doesn't?
I see.  May I?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Seems like a nice place.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Is there a problem, George?
What did you say?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Her show?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Huh?!
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
What's his name again?
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
It was a moment a weakness!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
It was a powerful air.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Why?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Zack, we've got to go.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Vietnam?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
You serious about having him over?
Lynette, where's Sid?
God help you, Lynette!
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Do you go to school?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I vote for the motel.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
What's the matter?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hi.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
You okay?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Sid, what happened?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
He said open it.
The hell does she want?
Get the fuck away from me.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Fuck!
Asshole.
They're coughing.
Can we come in?
You don't look so good.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
That door is a safely hazard.
Push that button for me, will you?
He's going down.
Yeah.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Small space?
Morse code?
We're never getting out of here.
Why?
What?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Those ain't cops.
Lemme see that rifle son...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
What the fuck?
So... we understand each other Judge?
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
...Glad you came man.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Alone...
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
You believe that?
When?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Sir?
How can we end this madness?
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Father...
What now, sir?
How old are you?
These four wagons must be his.
Cheraw Falls.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
A long time ago...
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Thank you.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
How many came back?
That bad?
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
It's gorgeous!
No-I guess not.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Do you swear?
Was it Pascow?
I can hardly read these.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Going to tell Ellie?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Did he speak?
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
You?!
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
A fool's errand.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Dead serious.
What's your name?
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
I can get you out of here.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
No.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Jack!
No, it's not.
You've seen it?
Commodore --
But --
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
... plastic.
How apropos.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
When did you...?
Somebody has to.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Yeah.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
What are these?
Why?
Look at this!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
I could go with you.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Argon's private lab.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
That's impossible.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Oh, Mother!
You have the cutest nose I've
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Give my regards to your managing editor.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Mr. Schuyler .
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
Araby?
How do you like your bath, sir?
You're my what?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
All right, outside!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
My error.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Did who?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Well, at best you might deny it.
We just thought that
Some bicarbonate - quick!
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Found no skeletons?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
That's puttering, sir.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Have you got any make up?
Having kind of a tough time.
Bud?
You can't go out there.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Oh yeah.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Sure is pretty.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
No, not that hedge. The other one.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Can we do any better?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
So what's the point?
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
They're happy like this.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
What's wrong?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
What do we do?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Don't get upset.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Tell me why.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
...just talking to you....
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Not very late.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Me?
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
So you think you can?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Oh that's great.
Have a good trip.
Do you wanna have sex?
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
Yeah.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
I don't know.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your Social Security number.
No one will know your name.
I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What's your problem?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
What's up?
What is this?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What happened?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Where you been?
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I know.
I know.
I know.
I know.
Ok.
Hello?
It's ok. That's alright.
Yeah.
It's not bad, it's ok.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
Marquis? Is that you?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Madeleine --
Has he hurt you?
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Free his mouth.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
I have a proposition.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
His wife's?
And he's never once attempted escape?
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
Oh. That.
Well?
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
How is the patient faring?
But I am history.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Louis
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Oh, why is that?
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Why did we not know about this sooner?
He lied to me
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
What are movies about, Orson?
Magic
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
But with compassion and insight--
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
I'll hire you  -- right now-
He'll destroy us.
How?
I'm sorry.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
Mank!
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Pardon?
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Answer me when I talk to you.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Huh?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Nah, she would never...
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Whatcha doin'?
Except fall down like a normal person.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
I did keep an eye...
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
But, Jake, I was just...
You're not interested in him?
You asleep?
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Where you been all day?
What are you doing?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Like disposing of their wives?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
-- until yesterday morning.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Jewelry?
Jefferies.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
For what?
I'll send you some comic books.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I can't. The police have it by now.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
She's only perfect.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Thank heaven that's over!
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Not yet, Jeff.
How's your leg?
And you love life?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Make the one you want.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Don't you ever have any problems?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
The same.
What for?
What's that?
Meaning me?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Just him.
I like you, you know?
What time is it?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Blood.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Except yourself!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
He depended on me.
No!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Are you really going to meet them?
What?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Who has?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Let's see how long we can stay under.
I came here before.
You sure?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
You promised to give it back.
Who's that?
I shot at one of them.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Do I have to spell it out?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
See?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Where's Dawson High School?
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
You still pretty upset?
You cold?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
Why did you do that?
You can't talk underwater!
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
What?
Why?
After he tried to shoot you?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
What?
That one?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
I was talking to Dad.
Must have a way with stationery.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
He wants... your "sister"...
Searching for a money man...
We sell children's toys --
I don't think it's negative five.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Do that again.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
No, Nick, no --
...maybe I die for Nick...
No!
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
He working for them on this one?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
You do.
You got one hour.
Start singing.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Where the HELL did he go?
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
What about the Powwow Safe?
How long ago was your makeover?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What about the money?
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Oh.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Rudy, don't move --
Don't move, Rudy!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Switch seats with me.
That's what it looks like!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
That I should've picked you up?
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Mr. Blue's dead?
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What's the cut, poppa?
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
Follow you where?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
What happened?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Gun shot.
You really think we were set up?
I'm cool.
No real people?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
What?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
So what is it?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Who shot who?
Anybody hurt?
Yes, ma'am.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Where do you keep the can opener?
There's a nice boy.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
I won't have you fighting over me.
How does she draw?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
At the ranch maybe?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Go on, hit me.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
You're not bein' quite fair.
But I want to stay.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Goodbye and thanks.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Clay Phillips.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
What do they look like?
How about California?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
My favorite memory was when we --
Really? That's amazing.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I meant you're into ghosts.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Hi Buddy.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Yes...
What about you, Buddy?
He's here.
Feel that?
Where's Shorty?
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
What are we gonna do?
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Yes, we made it!
I'm sorry.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
I take it you're not mad at me.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
My God! Is she dead?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
A little bit... Give me your belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Carl's a jerk!
Sorry, ma'am.
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Detectives, what is this about?
He goes to college with me!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
You bring me such peace...
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
You bitch!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
So you do drink?
It's him!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
What was that?
What is it, Betty?
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her  to see her  to touch her  in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Who the devil is he?
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
Could you find him?
What's that?
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
Perhaps.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
What?
Dr. Judd?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Graham is an unusual name.
You mean like "time flies"?
I don't know.
So what about kids?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
What about sex?
How did you know?
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Tell me your name.
Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes, I have. I will.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
On tape?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
I've told you.
But that was part of it?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Graham...
Yes. I just got busy.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
You son of a bitch!!
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
No, he left last week.
What do you mean, like physically?
What brought this on?
Lose something?
No, I didn't.
No, but I did.
You couldn't do it, period.
Do I know you?
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
How long will it take?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Cynthia, I don't know.
I've got to get back to the office.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
I'm intrigued.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Do you want me to stop calling?
No.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
What tapes?
Hi.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Kiss, kiss?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
So who changes?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
NIGHT NIGHT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
I know, I know, it's just...
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
We're the experts.
In a way...
McKinley?...McKinley?
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
Could you tell us a little about it?
Could I do that later?
But they only think they're happy.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
I want to see Brad.
F for...
F for...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
This could be worse than the old series.
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Why are you being so defensive?
Miles.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Are you a writer too?
Anything I'd know?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Just tell me.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Perfect.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
You should call her.
What?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
What's that supposed to mean?
So what's the plan?
Yep. Quite a day.
Come on, let me drive.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
What are you drinking?
Are you all right?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
What's the title?
Oh. You mean... today?
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Well...
Can I ask you a personal question?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
About two-thirty.
Were you ever going to say anything?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
That was big of him.
French or American?
So what do you think?
No.
A hair.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Hi sweetie.
You do?
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
They're distracting us?
It's getting stronger.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
It needs batteries.
These are D's; I need double A's.
I'm getting out now.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Don't do it!
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
I didn't know you were out.
Where are we?
I almost didn't.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
I got there just short of too late.
You've got a legitimate job.
What brings you into my saloon?
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I'm going to have to look into this.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Is this a fair mix?
What's this?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- It's called a projector.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Where are you?
Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
Hal, what are you doing?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
You have to see her.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
Hi, Dad.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
I love you, Lainey.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Wow. They called you their son.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
You're a doctor. What kind?
Know what?
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
Yes.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
You were great in the play, Cole.
And you know what else?
Communicate?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Yes, Cole?
Good for you.
Get off his case sweetie.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Aha. The Lovers.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Dammit, Carl!!!!
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
How... was she "called?"
Throw me one.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
Chicken sandwich?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Shit!
Wait a minute --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Second verse!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
What the hell are we going to do?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Rorschach.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Meat.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
What's he get if he wins here?
Why're you driving so fast?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Well?...
Driving, talking to me...
Where you from?
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Let's hit it.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
What are you thinking?
No what?
Order up!
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
No.
Let's get the hell outta here.
We still on schedule?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
I'm all ears.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Oh.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
He's giving them up?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You're sure?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
Really?
No, what did you say on the machine?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
FUCK YOU!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
Where's Israel?
...Does he know?
I wouldn't go that far.
Shoot.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
True?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
What'd you say?
What else did Padiche say?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
Listen --
You killed her!
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Perhaps it did.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
I wasn't.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
What happened to us, exactly?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Can you sleep?
But that's what happened before.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
You're lying.
I think they help.
What are you taking?
What does it want?
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
Occasionally.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Are you nervous?
Would you pick one out, please?
He said he'd kill me.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
What's to like?
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
You told her?
Are you okay?
When can I see you?
What a memory.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Mike?
My ass is falling.  It is.
For how long?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What did you watch?
Let me drive...
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
What about when she identifies him?!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
You in this with me?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You should'a brought the girl.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Let my kid go.
Under the table.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Sexual tension...
And Flash isn't?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
You get mugged or something?
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Hello, Liz.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
You sure about all this?
I am old enough to--
It's Friday night...
The record--
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
Creation? Or its opposite?
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Your dog ate it.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
No
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
What's the match gag?
Come on!
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
You won't get off that cheap.
You are being rude again.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
You did?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Grable, not Gable!
You're crying, Animal.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Who did?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What guy?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
Where is he now?
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Data?
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
I get it. I get it.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Sir?
Is there a problem?
Maybe they're not out there.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
It looks like we're too late.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Calm yourself, Bones.
Response?
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
David, I don't understand...
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Why?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Captain, what's happening?!
Mr. Scott?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
Count on our help, sir.
See! That shimmering area.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Close... There --
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Wait! Give me a chance --
Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
But -- why?
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What must I do?
Sir, may I suggest --
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
It never rains but when it pours --
Khan could be down there!
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Until now.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
Jim --
You're crazy -- !
But the child --
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I don't mean to intrude.
Let go -- he can't -- !
Don't you believe it.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
I'm getting a voice message... wait ... short range band. They say their Chambers coil is shorting their COMM system.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
A distinct possibility.
What IS working around here?
That's it?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
I did not think so.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
How?
<u>WHAT</u>?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Stop engines.
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
Shields activated!
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Hi... Busy?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
Fundoscopic examination --
Find it?
How long?
My name?
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
You sure you won't change your mind?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
Memory problems, too.
Iowa.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Where could you take them?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
... Gone?!
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
You tricked me.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Thank you, Admiral.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
What is our condition?
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
What is it?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Any luck...?
The explosive override -- ?
Deceive us?
Will it?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
Really.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
No... I want to stay with you...
I have to go home now.
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
How many?
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
I took these out of Data's neural net... they contain memory engrams...
I don't believe it happened that way.
Full impulse.
Will that stop the tear?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Captain...
Scanners are off line!
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Come in.  Hi.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Augh.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Where are you from most recently?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Cochrane?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
You're leaving, aren't you?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Captain?
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
They're bypassing Engineering...
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Thanks...
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
We're explorers not diplomats!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
It takes a lot of effort.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
He's a DOCTOR!
For insubordination.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Just the prototype.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Where?
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
Captain --
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
So... To happy endings.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
To new worlds...
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data!
A weapon.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
If you wouldn't mind.
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
I'm only half human.
No.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Cannon fodder.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
New Praetor?
So, human... you've met your better self!
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
We're being hailed.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
Sir --
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
And you're not as we imagined you.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
It's not quite the face you remember.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
With a full head of hair.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
Not so long.
Its too late.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
So theyve got him up and running.
The bond is broken.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
Praetor...
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Don't you think you should call a backup?
What do you do?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I don't like it, George...
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Dashboard.
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Minneapolis... good.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Are you from up there? Space?
Shit.
In your pocket, please...
When do you have to be here?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
No... The closest...
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
The captain...
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
Do you have music up there?
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
I will go. But not you.
Asshole!!
No one's traveling in this weather.
What are you saying?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Good morning.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
There.
Tell the baby about me.
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Jesus.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
What's going on?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
What?  Right Here?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Naw.  She won't call me.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Let's work it.
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
Looks like she was holding out.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
About what?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
What the fuck are you doing?
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Jesus, Lenny.
Forget her.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
And gives it to you.
Is this great fabric or what?
No it doesn't.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
And what about the guy that was following me?
How's Zander?
What is it?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Jesus.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
We have another one.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Thanks for the ride.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
It's a no-no.
He's called a couple times.
Jesus.
Then there's the other issue.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
You okay?
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Let's talk about Zero.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
"MyDick?"
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Ever since I've known you.
I'm sorry?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
You're a comedian?
Well, I should be getting...
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Hi.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
How many strokes?
Sounds more like Aids...
There are so many beautiful women here.
I'm such an asshole.
It's kinda money, actually.
What's he do?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Who threw this party, anyway?
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Mike?
Are you ready to order?
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Cut that shit out.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Double down.
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
She likes you.
I gotta use the phone.
Christy was nice...
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
Don't remind me.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
I hear she's getting real fat.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
No. Doesn't that suck?
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
You looked right at her, baby.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
The bear's got his claws back.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
Eat it, it's on the table.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Outside.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
Is it necessary?
This morning.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Barzini will move against you first.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Godfather, you understand everything.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Mike!  The party starting!
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
We should hear what they have to say.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
You really want to know?
Then the legs at the knees...
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Can you say it?
When will I see you again?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
How can you be sure?
A million times.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
He's drowning me!
Okay.  And did we know each other?
I'm intruding.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I met him in New York.
You like jazz!
And Rome.
You're breaking my ribs!
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Shoes too?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
He's downstairs.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
What?
Marge-maintenance.
Hello?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
That ring's so great. The green one.
Dickie?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Marge? Where are you going?
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
What's your secret?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
So -- are you travelling under R?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
I've been backpacking.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Was that Meredith?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Is there a firing range around?
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
I don't know...
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Where do you live?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
What kind of people?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Where are you going?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
But... Betsy...
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
What taxi driver?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
What's your real name?
That's a nice name.
No.
Well, I tried.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You a narc?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
How?
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
There's porno theatres for that.
Twenty-six.
Is that so?
Sure.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
I'm here to see Iris.
Real down.
Yeah.
Had a close one.
Could we change the subject?
Thank you.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Partners?
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Did you bring along something to read?
Dad?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Me too.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
Whoa.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Nine hundred...
They're not bad.
Now, did you remember that, or...
What... do you remember?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
No wallet, huh?
Yes.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Ha!
I know.  A Purple Heart.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
When'd you quit smoking?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
That's my r-r-rent.
Please, sit.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Who?
I was wondering...
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
And the second?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Could I have a puff?
Are you coming to my party?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Good morning.
See where I'm pointing?
See them two big trees across there?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Of course.
I need her exact name, you see.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Oh. I see.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Maybe we ought to leave.
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I couldn't ask you to.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
No, of course not.
Some of them are.
What are you? A policeman?
What kind of law?
We... we went to school together. College.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
So you didn't go to school together.
But not for me.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What it was, probably...
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
When will they stop?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Help how? What do you want to do?
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Birds?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
I'm only a student.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
It might be an interesting case.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
This is a gift.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
Can anyone hear what we say?
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Was that it? Well, ok.
You think I'm crazy.
Think maybe knives do?
Fuck! What do you want?
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
How do you know?
Are you ok?
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
You know.
They botched the execution.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
What's with your friend there?
Why are there so many?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think they'll ever find him?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
It was a wonderful day.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
No -- no, thanks.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
They're gaining on us!
Shut up!
What's going' on?
With him?
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
What's that smell!?
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Ocean air!
He met a girl.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
-- a job.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
But you passed the test!
What's your name?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
Why not?
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Do I have to do this?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Who are you calling?
What's the matter?
Sixteen.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Now why'd you go and...
How you doin', old boy?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let's open it.
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
MacReady!
Torch them!!
MacReady!
Anything?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
We're on fire!
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What if it doesn't come?
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Get back!!
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
You know of them?
When was his mother taken?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
What's it all for?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Why would you let me go back?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
May I help you?
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
You're late.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Where's the challenge in that?
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Did you hear me, lad?
Oh, that explains everything.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Alexander...?
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes.
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Yes, sir, he --
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
My father has gone to a better place.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
You know that's not true.
Sir, if I may --
No, you're safe --
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Should we be...
And what's that?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I don't understand.
What case?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
The future doesn't look different?
Can you drive?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
What's this?
This is pretty good. Considering...
Who's the nut?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
No!
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Did you get married real young?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Louise.  Where are we going?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
How do I look?
What happened to your hair?
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
What'd I say again?
He said they're charging us with murder.
What?!  What d'you think?!
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
You're a good friend.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Go.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Nah.
Mary again.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Healy you dog!
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
How about -- ?
Mary ah, forget it.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Urrggghh...
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
I think your life's about to change.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Uh, that's okay.
What are you doing?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh... Sully.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
An old flame?
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Oh yeah. Fine.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Twenty-two.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
So you're a writer?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
Is it the frank or the beans?
No, no, please!
No! I was pissing!
Piggyback ride.
Franks and beans!
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
When are you going to be home?
What's happened?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Hey, sport. You winning?
So what've we got today?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Let's get out of here.
I don't care. Cancel it.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
Hello?
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Bob?
Hey.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I see.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
A murder. On the reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Her oil pan is shot.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
I'll sleep around a little.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
X21, give me a 20.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
How so?
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
The what?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
What if he's not?
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Where are we?
What kind of games?
One more.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Sir?
MAVERICK.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
I'm pulling up.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Gotta go, man.
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Come on, we're next.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Who's the hell is that?
Helping him in.
Morning, Coogan.
Why?
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Or you can quit.
So, where to?
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Stop fighting and get out.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
On his way.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Why not?
What trip?
I've got a lock!  There!
And you believe him?
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
All right.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I think you better leave.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Like what?
He's lying.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
What the hell is that, anyway?
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
You're full of shit.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
What the hell are you doing?!!
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
I brought it... to the coroner.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Don't hurt him.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Oh really?
You can't remember that -- !
How can you remember that?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Where?
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
...Jesus!
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I embroidered.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
-- How could I help you?
Oh come on, Cecil.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
I don't think I know that name.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
And why was an exception made?
Tell me some other things about her.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where is the ring?
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
What is it?
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
The usual, 9:15.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Goodbye, Muffin.
How did the car get back here?
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
But I love you, Laura.
What'll it be?
Nice night.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Laura, do you love me?
We were supposed to be together.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Who was that?
Did you come home during the day last week?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Leland, what are you doing?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
I don't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years...
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Concannon...?
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Say it.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
We went to Code Blue...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
She getting good care over there?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really. How wonderful for you.
What happened...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
Not if you don't grow up...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
...hey, I don't need your charity...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Mick. Mick. Mick...
Been a long time, huh...?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Uh... the admitting nurse...
...four years ago...
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I just saw her.
What?
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
You look kinda lost yourself.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
They've blocked it!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
What'll we say to 'em?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
No, you don't.
Just be careful, okay?
Guess so.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
I want my kid out of here now!
What?
Why does God let there be bad things?
What...what is that?
You okay?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Darker.  More...evil?
What...happened?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Studio B.
The car's no there yet?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
That was Nancy, not me!
Yes?
Now?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You sound so sure.
What?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
How old are you, son?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Yeah.
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Do you have your ticket?
What the hell is going on?
Good.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
No way!
It was so real...
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Well, spit it out.
Stow away?
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Son-of-a-bitch.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
They tell you that?
What?
What do you think?
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
About yourself?
Do you have something to say?
I'm not gonna kill it.
What's it going to be?
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
Yes.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Why should it?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Club Zanzibar.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
Hasta siempre.
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
What brand'd she smoke?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
Actin' funny how?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
That don't smell like a More.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Huh?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
What was this one?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Oh God, Sailor.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Sail?
He's the kind liked it.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Mama???
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Have it your way... But you want it.
What do you want me to do about it?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Get rid of him?
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Explain it... I told you.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
I just mean...
Is that just beer?
So. Is he any good?
He is. Take my word for it.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
He lives with his mother.
James? My James? What's happened?
Which is?
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Crabtree.
So -- what do we do now?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
No. But I don't think that matters.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
No...
I'll be... somewhere else.
The last month maybe.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Go ahead.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
Oh.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
The one that left you?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I'm a little worried, James.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Jesus.
Easy there.
Emily left me this morning.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Oh?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I lost it all.
I know.
Does he still love you?
The more the merrier.
He's writing his name in water.
Who's this ?
Excuse me?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Maybe I should read it.
Hardapple?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
George Sanders?
There's so many...
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Foreman now.
I've got some good news.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
I don't like starlings.
Don't you have friends?
Cherry?
Do you believe in them?
But you are taking it?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Have you seen Walter?
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Banished... yeah.
Robin?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
No.
And how's your job?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Why not?
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
That's right.
Try it.
How's the journal?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
What are you afraid will happen?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Go home, Walter.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
What?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
It's not what you think.
What was prison like?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
It's a bad idea.
I say we call it quits.
What's this?
I don't need a plant.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
She-hit.
How you guys doing?
I can't believe you let them do this!
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
I haven't worn mine in months.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
You owe me one, Virgil.
I don't know how!
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
He's convulsing!
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Hippy, you pussy.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Stand by on the ROV.
What kind of light?
Then how come you're not with him?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Which one shall I wear?
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
But how could you say such a thing?
Have you decided?
Find anything?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Claudia, let's get married?
That's why I asked you...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
No, Sandro... Please...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
Good night, my love.
Have you ever been in love?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Where is she going?
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
We have a radio like this, too.
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
No.
She'd punish me.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Why?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Why?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
What do you mean?
Who?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
Something I ate.
From their heads...
What do you mean?
Would you like some?
Did your mother see angels often?
Why not?  Mmm?
Why not?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
You can tell me.
Yes?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
How did you have a baby?
Why?
Why were you afraid?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Yes.
Are you frightened?
No...
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Look into the convent records.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
I don't know.
???
No, no, no...
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Could there have been anyone else?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
Not simple, no.
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
What?
When was that?
Do you know what she did to her?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Did you know she was pregnant?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
For what?  An abortion?
The baby?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Of course, John.
The usual ten per cent?
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
I'm a deserter.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Why aren't you at work?
Shurrup!
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
We're nearly there, sir.
Are you going in?
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Get him out of here!!
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Ringo!
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Oh!
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
And what do you do about it?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
You're only right.
What are they saying?
Hello, Grandfather!
Yeah ... so what?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
I'll brook no denial!
Oh you are, I know you are.
Well, you look like him.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
Where's my grandfather?
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
I'll set John on you!
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
What is it?
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
What's wrong?
Breathe deeply.
A transmission?
What do you mean?
Where's it coming from?
What the hell's going on?
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Hey, guess what?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
It's over, Hunter.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Now what's wrong?
What?  What was that?
What do you mean, no?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
What common objects?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Don't count on it.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
That way.
What's wrong?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
No, it's coming.
Oh God, oh God no.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
They're on the next level up.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
What film?
Take us up.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Now what?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Which presumably means...
It was time for that a couple days ago.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
Kill me...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
What do you need?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Wait.  Lost it.
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Four.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Phoebe?
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
It needn't be.
You take charge.
Just like that, eh?
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Champion to champion.
That's not true!
Then say so.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Let's go sit by the piano.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Right here. A minute ago.
Good luck, genius...
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Take care of yourself out there...
Knit me a muffler.
You in a hurry?
Yeah... I will.
It's a good thought.
For instance what?
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
I will not calm down!
Well, I am.
It's not nonsense.
Never try to outguess Margo.
A cowboy.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Ah...
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
- and for you.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Eve... don't cry.
I think I know...
You talk just as Addison said you did.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
No, don't go...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
Right here.
Ain't it the truth?
Do you want it on?
With tears?
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Coming?
It's just possible she didn't...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Lloyd, be careful...
Eve.
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Who is it? What's it all about?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
To you, too?
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Are you breaking the contract?
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
Hey?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
That was fun.  What now?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
See her?  Get anything?
I hate both parties.
Who'd you vote for?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Jesus--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
What's a real denial?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
--I saw him. He verifies.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
They are not my clients.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
...go on, go on...
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Anything?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No, it was good.
Good work, Ostreicher.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
All right, I got some scotch.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This.  Right now.
You're gonna shit your pants!
Um...Chris --
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
I think I've had one.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
No.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
You're so big!
Ow, what the hell?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
What the heck is this?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Jim?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yes.  Seriously.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
This was remade?  Into what?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
I still think you're okay.
What's up, fellas?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Oh, Kev.
Let me know.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Hey...
About the other day...I've been thinking.
See -- this is the nicest room.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
What reputation?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
That junior chick?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
The key is don't look down.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
They're coming!
What the fuck!? You too!?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
I know where he'll go.
Didn't even have to ask.
No wonder he let her go.
Oh God. Shit...
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Claude...?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
What've you got?
What did she say?
Here.
Well?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
Hurry, Grandmama!
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Who did you hear it from?
Poor Meetoo!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Who are you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
See? The Princess is under there ...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
What do you mean, next?
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
Lyndon Johnson?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Well, then, w-who was?
Hi. Hi, hi.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Why not?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh, thank you.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
We can digest our-
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Hey?
big subject with me, yeah.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
M'hm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
I'm following you and David, if you-
Oooh.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, good. Okay.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You look very pretty.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Bad?
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Probably on their first date, right?
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Stop calling me Max.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
What's the matter?
The one with the V.P.L.
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
You fired the cleaning woman?
They're persecuted enough!
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
M'mmm.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
No, no, no, not at all.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Yeah.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
There were many men interested in you?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
What's that?
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
You don't have any clothes on.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I'm not.
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
What is that thing?
Would you leave us alone right now?
I never put myself in harm's way.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
No luck.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Otis!  No barking!
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
It's an unfair advantage.
Dolphins.  Great.
She left the fucking gate open.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
What are you saying?
Anyone else?
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
No.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Joking.
And I you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Scout's honor.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Medallions.
Yes.
That's very nice.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
How do you do, Skye?
Ryan.
I don't need a drug.
We could hardly say no.
Do you need anything else?
Would you, like, marry him?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
She's even better looking in the flesh.
How?
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Like the last time.
Why not?
So tell me, how's it going?
Panes?
Like Joe.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
Break's over.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Really?
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Yes, what else?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Ma'am?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
You mean tonight?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
What is it?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
Too slow?
Are you all right?
I know so. He's a taker.
I see you bought some napkins.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
I guess so.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Baxter?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You left your wife?
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
I see.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Now hold on, Baxter --
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
How do you spell her last name?
Where are you moving to?
That so.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
No kidding.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Kubelik.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Will you excuse me?
It's been hell.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
I want you back, Fran.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Where do you live?
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
You're out of your skull --
Who the hell are you?
Winning the war by yourself.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
What cat  ?
They nail him for it bad ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
I only met Kurtz once.
You didn't like him.
What does that mean ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate ?
What -- happened here.
Who is he?
No, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
American weapons?
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
Fucking savages.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
I think think a lie stinks.
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
You hear it again?
Captain Willard?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
Cognac?

Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?

A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
You should know something.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll go into town with you.
Did you catch Corbett?
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
You're hurt.
Desmond.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Told you I'm fine!
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
I need to rent a cabin.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
What's wrong?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Why the smirk?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
You hear me?  Ben?
...Ben never sent a signal.
It's Sam Wilder!
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Do you love me?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Spencer.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
What about your mother?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Why did yo do this for me?
I'm not kidding.
So. Anything else?
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks, Melvin.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
Stop asking everyone.
You don't owe me that.
What do you want?
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
No!!!
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
But what about...
What the heck are those for?
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Help!
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Terrify me?
Is he dead yet?
What?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Now we'll both call him.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Picking on me won't help.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Why are you doing this?
Where you from?
What are you doing?
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
So what happens now?
Okay.
What does that fucking mean?
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Hello, Robert.
A player?
Um, five.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
I work for the government.
Twenty large?  That's all?
Now what?
You want me to pump?
So this is something between you and him?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
With computers.
I killed him.
More or less.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Women?  No... not really.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
About?
Do you think about the game?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
You should knock.
How was the beach?
Where did you learn it?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Then, we wait.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I told you, he will.
Do you have ulcers?
I think I got one today.
Attraction is a complication?
Uh-huh.
Four minutes.
Electra --
Why didn't you fade?
You wish to close this account today?
What are you having?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Anything in it?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Fifteen crowns.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
No, why?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
It must be on the other side of this.
Need any disks?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Nope.
Perfect!
Afternoon!
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Now you're using that word.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
And if you're wrong.
What do you want me to do?
What about me?
I can't go with him.
Yeah, pretty well.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
No, I love you, really.
Yeah, for sure.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Enjoying our hospitality?
And the students?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
She asleep?
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
It could help with a new car --
You look nice. I should have dressed.
Who are you?
I'm very sorry --
You don't know me.
'Is it really me?'
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'll get something for us to drink --
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
No.
You have to believe to have faith.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
People can see.
It's a start.
Like fire.
It's only 7:30.
Your turn.
Stand right here.
Assholes. This happen to you?
So what do you want to see?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Ergo?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
I'm asking how much.
How about your family?
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You have materials for the side bearings?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Hi, Marty!
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Fine..
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Maybe if I used my left....
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Eight thirty.
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
You answered the door!
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Hi. where's Cato?
Yeah, I guess.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Well, Kit...
Sure is pretty.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What for?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
You still in school?
You want to go for a ride?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Don't call me stupid.
I can look and see.
Everybody loves trout.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
What?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Okay, friend. Start running.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
Anybody we know?
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Dead.  Damnit!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Was she pretty?
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Never.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Not here!  No Overthruster!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What's his problem?
Pictures don't lie.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Well I have to come up with  an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
How d'ya like your room!
Chet!
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I beg your pardon?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on 
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
It's okay... It's okay...
You'll be back?
But Charlie  why me? Why 
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
L.A.P.D.
What did... What did he 
Big fuckin' deal.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
He teach you to do it?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Where were you tonight?
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
How are you, Nick?
How about the coke?
No?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
How long were you having sex with him?
Yes, you do.
What's your new book about?
You like playing games, don't you?
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
Aren't you going to thank me?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
No thanks.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
I hate rugrats.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever tie him up?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
What kind of talk?
Thanks.
Was she ever suspect?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
I don't know.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Were you with him last night?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
I'm a painter, too.
Naa..
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
What's with the wigs?
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Is Jean Michel here?
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Not what?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Yeah.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Blue? Where?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
We got beat.
No, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee 
It looks done.
... babies.
Hi.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Would you check out my studio some time?
What's your name, man?
Come on.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
You're a fast mover.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
OK! Goodbye!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
I guess this mean we won.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
What happened?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
I don't.  So, no.
Working late?  I'm touched.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Is there something wrong, sir?
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
We gotta get those locks changed.
No sign of the snowman.
Winded, old timer?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
The dreams again, sir?
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
...A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Al?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
La'chiem.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
That kid is amazing.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
How'd you find us?
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
Go ahead. You can say it.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
Thank you, Vicki.
Is this what you wanted?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Do you want a drink?
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
I missed you, Lieutenant.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
... Thank you.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Peanuts?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Alexander... I know you.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
There aren't hotels?
Jesus.
There were three strawberries.
Liar.
shhh...
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Goodnight Annie.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Maybe two cars.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Interesting suit.
Shut up, Kevin.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Uh... bye-bye.
Really? I poop too much.
They perk me right up.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
They look like a couple of kids chief.
You see what I see, Bork?
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Cabin fever, hon?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
That little girl saw us.
I guess we open it.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Nobody else can.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
So can I?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Wait for who?
This is <u>my</u> town.
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
How'd you do on the science test?
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
W... What is it?
He's your cousin.
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
What do you think, honey?
Stepmother's...
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
You don't have a key?
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Their wedding clothes.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... He's gone, Chauncey.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey!
Your leg must be getting better.
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Yes.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Do you like it?
... Are you sure you like it?
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes, it is very good!
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Good morning, Louise.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... How long have you been living here?
1952...?
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Correct.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
No headaches?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... How are the kids getting along?
Good night.
So...? Where the hell is it?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Well, Ben... I...
You take care too, Bobby.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Malkovich.
I don't know.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Don't forget me.
I need a shower.
It's Elijah.
A better friend.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Money, Miss Warts?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
Security.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
What?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
The Great Mantini?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Can I get you a drink?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Bad dream, darling?
You've got to be kidding.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
YOU HURT ME.
You don't sit with me!!
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You grown.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Back stiff?
Should I wake her?
No...no...no..
Out where?
I know Denver.
True.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
What, baby?
Hiya Allan.
Fuck.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Hey, man, I'm not--
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Excuse me?
What's this?
They range up to three thousand.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What do you mean, Dude?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
If what's during league play?
Burkhalter.
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
No.  Here.
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
"Johnson"?
Huh?
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
From who?
Dieter Hauff?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Jeffrey.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
No, but--
Theodore Herzel.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Have it your way.  The point is--
What the hell is this?
Wooden bridge, huh?
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
They're nihilists.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
Uh-huh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
Huh?
Yeah, and you were--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Dude here.
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
You monsters!
Who the hell is he?
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
What was that?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Thank you.
Why do you hate us so much?
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Put it back in park, Blade.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Nomak?
Yes?
Tell me something, Skid --
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Going somewhere?
Whistler, I --
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
You shouldn't be here.
Why?
But he's a policeman --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Like what?
You care about him, don't you?
You don't look so good.
How long have we been driving?
It won't work on you.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
How could you be a part of this?
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
What -- ?
Who are you people?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What do you mean?
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Why?
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Why are we here?
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Anna--
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Nothing. I dunno--
Just now?
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
You want a hand?
Okay, a blur.
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
No fucking.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Boy Kurth.
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
Yeah. Me too.
That's a "j."
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Okay, but--
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Just hold on!
Elly Kedward?
Dad...?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
--I know!
Heather.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
Who was it?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
When you don't they're usually nice.
Ray?... What time is it?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...Who?
...So?
So how long have you know Meurice?
It'll pass.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Sign.
...What?
Yeah. Is it...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...What did you do with the bodies?
What's this?
This.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay?
Frank?
Bull.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Do you like that?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Hi. can I come in?
Oh shit.
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
Who, Dorothy?
No thanks.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
What happened to him?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Brilliant.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay. yeah, call.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Everything okay?
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
How ya doin' Dad?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
I'm going out for awhile.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
You can't sell this to your friends.
Excuse me?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I don't know...
And I only deal with you?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What's that?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
What do you got there, Diego?
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
How are we doing?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Cocaine?  How much?
Barbara.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
I want money.
Money.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
Hi.
Give this to Mom, will you?
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
I don't know.  My name is George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
What?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Well, here I am.  See?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
For instance, something like this?
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ... Explain better ...
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
And how many are we?
No ...
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Who is speaking?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
What about the will?
That's what my report will read.
What can we prove?
Then how did it get into his body?
What did they argue about?
Objection, Your Honor.
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
What happened after that?
-- And what did you suggest?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
What did you prescribe for her?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
Where did you meet him?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What did he say?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Yes.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
What do you have in your purse?
Hi, Joe.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
You lied to me!
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Sugar or honey?
What's that for?
You killed him -- didn't you?
I'm dropping the case.
Hello?
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
I can back it up.
If you want me to.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
Humped
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
It's more involved than that.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Yes.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Eeeww!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Grateful!?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Then what happened?
You ought to write these stories down.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You drink bug repellent?
No, I'm just saying --
Yeah?
How about if I set the table?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I can't do this, honey.
Where was she?
What do you want me to say?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Died there?  How?
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Is this Hell?
Looking to score?
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I want you to do something for me, baby.
What it will be.
You know I can't.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
How do you know?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
You gotta use your imagination.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Not bad.  What for?
It's impossible!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Fuck.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
Where is the money?
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
We were in a car accident --
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Okay, sure, Mick.
We was worried about you, Cease.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Okay, one drink.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
Five years is a long time.
Because it's the truth.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What you heard wasn't sex.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
Then what?  Exactly.
Yes.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
Why?
It's me.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Done.  We go now.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
What do you mean?
What is Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
...yes -- oui -- uh...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride.
I need a ride out of here.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
-- you could put it together --
Okay, so you're a victim.
So this is it, right?
Okay, so...
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I trusted you.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What is that?
xxxxxx
And that's it?
You have ID?
He run away often?
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
...Be back.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thanks very much Sam.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
You are late.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Enough though, eh?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What's she done?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
How could you do this to me?
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Ow! That hurt!
Where are you taking me?
No, really.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
What?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
What happened to you after ...
Isn't it? Whose is it?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Damn! Blast!
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Yes?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
What the - ? How did you - ?
Are you expecting anyone?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
IB Bangin.
Do you have any music?
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
Did you see my father?
Yes?
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Five years.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
I hate vodka.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Do it!
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Keep it to yourself.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Hold it down, okay?
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
You know what I...
Hi.
He excels at gratitude.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Eventually rising to...
Well, whatever you think.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
Don't go.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
How do I get out of here?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Why so glum?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
One year...almost one year.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Yes.
What happened?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Okay.  Good night.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
I got promoted for things like that.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough.  That's enough.
What are you doing here?
It's kind of dark -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
See you later -
Hi Walter.
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
May I please have another little kiss?
Did you hear what he said?
Are you ready?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
I wonder what his deal is.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
What did he say?
You...made that?
People seem to like my cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I saw your...cat.
Hi.
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I don't think so Mayolia.
T-tell him that?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Invite me in, Pike.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hi, Buffy.
You okay?
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
What show is this?
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I am a God!  A God!
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
He did what he was supposed to.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
What are we doing?
Beverly Center.
You were supposed to be here at three.
How do you know all this?
All right.  What do we do now?
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Here?
No -- you don't have to --
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Same one.
What!?!
Five?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
There isn't time.
All right.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Hi, guys.
What... are you?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Write that down.
Buffy?
They'll kill us!
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
What are you talking about?
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Well I guess this is it.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
Damn.
He' s confused--
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
I got released.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
He's a good student.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
You a God damn witch?
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
What's wrong?
I'm trying to thank you.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
I'd kill ya.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
No.
Well tell 'em, honey.
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
It's a miracle.
What the hell's going on out there?
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Ohh!
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Okay?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Ginger called me.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
You've got to stop her.
Half of everything is mine.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Understand?  I'm sorry.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Oh, it's so soft.
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Hello.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
How serious?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
I am not!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Should I let her in like - ?
...and hypocrisy.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Yeah, okay.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
...worst possible time for me.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Fucker!
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Hey!
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Is that what you did?
Carmine left?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Are you sure?
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Uh-huh. Good.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
I can see that. Sure.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Yes!
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Right.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Come here, come here.
You walk past me?
Yeah, but they're complaining.
He's here.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
What's the matter with you?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
What's the matter...
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Are you sure?
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
I loved you.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
I don't know what came over me.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
You're late.
Maybe.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
Who's on the phone?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
Will you two cut it out?
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Do I know you?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
What do they need her for?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
26th off Wilshire.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
What do you do for a living?
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Yes?  Yes?
God, if he doesn't come back --
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
At least one.
You timed that beautifully.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Who's in back?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
What's that supposed to me?
You were at the Emerald that night?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
Naturally.
Both hands on your lap.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Five ... six.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Who are you working for?
They saw you kill the driver.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Sure.
Satisfied?
It's in the process.
And not a nickel.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
I'm in awe.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
The 405 is coming up.
He's what she should run a mile from.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
See that, Col?
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
You see that, Col?
Don't be like that --
See, they get the wrong idea.
Look, I'm sorry.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
How'd you guess?
Jimmy.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
No --
What would he think?
I think you do.
Even now.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Come on, Dil --
Details, baby, details.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Should have stayed a girl.
She own you, Jimmy?
Do you like me even a little bit?
Why?
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
What pills?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Your soldier.
You killed my Jody
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Did you give him it?
Leave us, Judie.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
So you did fuck up.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Jude?
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
Why?
He's at home.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Eat something, would you?
I seen your fucking face.
How did you know it was her?
No?
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Why can't we?
Didn't look like that to me...
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Who's Dil?
Do you?
Is it bad?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
The teddy bear?
Come and get me, soldier --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Oh, you should see your face.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
Now what?
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Why not?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Not my room!
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Does it hurt?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Or Tex?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Are you going to listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elyses"  Why there?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Up there! It is up there!
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
What are you doing here?
We'll find you a hotel.
What was all that?
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I wasn't --
What was it?
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
But why do you want a divorce?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
What's he up to?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
I don't see him.
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah?
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
One more time.
is there anything you do?
No honey.
You were eavesdropping.
What did you hear?
What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
Hello?
Of what?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
Your brother told us.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Pay no attention to me.
Me? Why me?
_ Your father raped someone?
Yes.
You're the killed.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Cut it out.
Are you O.K.?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Wait.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Yes.
Yeah.
Now don't be nervous.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
That wasn't me ...
Great. 
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
...moron.
Uh, huh?
Oh.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
...doing?!
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
We're clear.
...-er.
...the ice cream for money!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
Holy shit...
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...here!
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
 Yeah.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Yeah.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
They're takin' off.
Okay. 
What?
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
No.
Be cool.  Be--
We're worried...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
...without compunction.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
We've got it...
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...-lar.
...-bility.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.
No!
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...that.
Mm-hm.
Do you know what'll...
Good to see you again, Leo.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...comes up that road.
I wanna patch in from...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...gear?
....-lene.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
...-tainer!
No.
...-time,  remember?
Ah.
Video lock.
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
And where are you going?
...-time. 
My secret?
...fishin'.
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...you, Mason?
What?  Say again, Ma-...
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
So you don't remember...
Lying? 
Let me see your...
...on the other end of this phone.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
We worked in Chinatown together.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Avocado groves?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
What are you talking about?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Why?
Where did you get this material?
The apple core?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
My husband's at the office.
What?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Over the water department, or over you?
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
I saw him.
Okay, give me the keys.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Walsh here?
Where'd he go yesterday?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Who?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Gittes.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
This?
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
What are you doing here?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
Now what can you see?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Thanks for all you've done for me.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
But...who...
But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Three cents.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
What's the matter?
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Is it good?
No, Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
We haven't heard from him.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Let him finish, Charles.
Where's the towel?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Tired?
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Yes?
What do you mean by that?
Hello, Brad.
What check?
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
How long have you been smoking?
Excuse me, but...
Fifty-five.
I think you'd better leave now.
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
So where is he?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Am I missing something here?
When did you get back?
You saw it?
Well... kind of, sort of?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
You don't have anything to do with it.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
You're serious. You want to date again.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
He's not invited.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Are you open?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
That's easy to say from over here.
Cute cat. What's his name.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
Shit!
You're late.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Seven months.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Allan Harris.
Empire.
I guess.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
There aren't.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Which ones?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
See? There you go again.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
What happened to all the Gatorade?
You hate people.
Oh, my god.
No!
He made it, hunhh?
You know.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
You're happy?
You should shit or get off the pot.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Do I know you?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
You used to go out with her?
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
The porno mags?
Here. Now leave me alone.
What? What is that?
Typically male point of view.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
No; who were the three, besides me?
All right. Name it.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Really?  You're the best.
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I'm not sad.
Dental School.
Like hell you are!
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
I'm going with you.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Two...
Four...five...
That's a virtue isn't it?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I know...
Resuscitation?
A flare up...
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
What if he can't?
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Remember the first time we came up here?
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
He never hurt anybody.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
You're looking at him.
Oh, my God!
I don't know about totally.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
What's the code, Travers?
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
I beg your pardon?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
What crime did you commit.
Good.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Yes sir.
Religion?
Brown hair, is it?
No, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Are you referring to the background score?
Good. What do you want?
Fucking hell...
I was quite enjoying that.
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Mothballs, sir.
Carry on, Chief.
Pitiful rookerful...
Moloko-plus.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Annie...it's Max.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
You still carrying passengers?
No.
What kind of question?
What?
What?  What did you say?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
I was with Max when he got the call.
It's nothing.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
He'll keep calling.
How long you think this'll take?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
It's home.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I think he's dead.
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
What are you doing?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Music.
I don't know any Rwandans.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
You go every night?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
What, no insurance?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
In case he asks.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
Would you have called her?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
As in...? 
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
The sound of love.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
I don't see the connection.
You going to warn him?
What was your horse's name?
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
If my universe had a hub...
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
That was him.
Please put it down.
Did you see the van back there?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Now what?
Is that what they told you?
Back where?
I love you, too.
Liza Sutton is dead.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
And you have no idea where he lives?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Which way did he go?
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Hope there's a cartoon.
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
You mean --
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
What's the status of the decryption effort?
What?
And?
How can that be?
Can't we get rid of them?
Please answer the question, Doctor.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
You live here.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
Some kind of circuitry...?
What's that?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
We could be together again --
Ellie.
That you, Valerian?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Champagne please.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I flinched.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
How do you mean?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
We saw the broads.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Lemme see it!
Well, whatta we got here?
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Like I always do?
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Oh Lord!
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
I'm in.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
One, two, three... 
He'll never make it.
Now look what you did.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
I want to die.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
You bastard!
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
He was lying.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
What book?
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Is it an ongoing case?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
Ruben.
Halloran.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Are you always so bold?
They all have one...
Okay.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Sergeant?
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What is it?
What does he want from you?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
What kind of place is this?
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Fuck me.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
You did the right thing.
Will you get time off to do that?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
Must you walk so quickly?
Yeah?
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess.
A daisy for the lady.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Wow.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Something like that.
What is it? Are you OK?
What?
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess we need to talk.
Can I put these here for tonight?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
But what about that math project?
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Sure. Why?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
How's it look?
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
You've already robbed the safe?
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
-- Super what?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Hopefully no one.
You're sure?
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Don't bullshit me.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
What hotel?
What do we do?
They don't have a wine list.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
I knew I should have driven.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
It's good.
How's my brother?
Fuck you, grease-ball!
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
Holy shit.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
I can't even hear myself think.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Can't sleep?
What are you doing?
Sounds boring.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
You're home late... or should I say early?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
I've missed you.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
They couldn't do anything for me.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Don't waste my time.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
We've got company.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
So what year are you going into?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
How do you know I've been with several women?
At this hour? I don't think so.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
And you promise to abide by it?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
I'm... I'm alright.
What are you reading?
Good for you.
Hi.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
German.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
See that wasn't so bad.
Well do you like him?
Did you hide the letters?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
He made you give him a blow job.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
You think?
Where are you going?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Loser.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
So? How'd it go last night?
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Well done.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's not here.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
What song, dear?
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
It's your play.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Amy, not that old tree!
No, I didn't.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I shall want you for always.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
May I pet the deer?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
I like stories.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Where?
At least your PMS is over.
What the hell is the tampon test?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
So where's this infamous arm now?
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You expecting someone?
I wish I only had your problems.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
What?
Uh huh. So pee.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Where'd you get the bike?
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No, she died when I was twelve.
What are those?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Uh.... hi!
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
You didn't say it.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Here's a towel.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
We can get a warrant if you like.
No, I have a cat.
It's for you. Frida.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
He was found a few blocks away.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Why give yourself up?
I don't know who they are.
Bad dreams?
How much do you usually get paid?
First Lady...
I'm not certain about...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What the hell is this?
.. Nothing.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
Die, you pond scum!
I don't give a shit.
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
We think so.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Check his kids.
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Do we have anything on the budget today?
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Oh my God...
Will he be alright?
Thanks, I wrote it.
Yes, Mr. President?
You're not?
Your government needs your help.
Really?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Who?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
... . Ellen.
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
It was okay?
What?
I never thought I'd...
I missed...
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
What is it?
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What?
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
It's because of me.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
How was dinner?
It will?  How do you figure?
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Yes sir.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Charlie...
Where'd you find them?
What happened?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
This is stupid.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
Too bad.
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is it then?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
From you?
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
Put more into it!
And what? These things are octopusses?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
We were talking about my schedule...
Where are my men?
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
Seen a lot of islands?
Self sufficient...
I don't know where it is!
Like cattle...
What is it?
It's not them...it's it...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Let's just keep going.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
She's gone...
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
She fucked you?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Whee-uu!
You're back.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
I have to go.
No, I --
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
You mean...?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
What kind of beer would you like?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
You seem... disturbed.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You do?
What'd he say?
Is he from here?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
How many bullets?
I like it, Nick.
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
What?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Cynthia! Sure.
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
Give it to me.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Kill him... kill him.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
You okay?
You my partner?
I'm ready.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Married?
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
I'm going to be a policeman.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
You're lying.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
What do you want?
She couldn't be gone!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Where's everybody?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Your butter money?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Mary --
Why don't they come --
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
What's that you say, Son?
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I want someone to talk to ...
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
Nothing...
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
How are you doing?
Yeah...
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
You try calling the police?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Don't fuck with me ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
You like me?
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Yeah.
Thanks again, Sam.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Where's the money?
... The bodies out the door.
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
They're trying to come through the door!
What'd he say?
Okay, who's the head teller here?
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Fuck!  We did it!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Why are you doing this?
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
This is Bishop.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Yes.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Okay.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Is that you, Domino?
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town...

The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Really? Did you play in a band?
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
Can you tell?
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
You were good.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
I own a brownstone on this block.
What did he do this time?
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Squash it.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
Let it be broke.
Can you pay me now?
We both do.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Mookie?
I've been working hard, getting paid.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
Later for you.
Feels good.
Where are you going?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Smack him back.
You deaf or what?
Who's your favorite basketball player?
I didn't know you could read.
It's e-vit-able.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Hi.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Would you like something to drink?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
HARRY? Are you okay?
The name's Walter.
Mom, you know that never works.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
I think it's just over there.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Your mom made a move on me.
I don't know. Owwww.
Nope. I was right.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
A float!
Wait, wait!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
TURK, leave him alone.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Yes, what?
Do I know you?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
So what do you keep in there?
Everything?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
Yes?
Yes, my Lord.
I can assure you...
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Remove her gag!
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Why do they come?
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
THE PAIN!
Did they try and fail?
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Bela, what happened?!
Bela, are you ready?
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
What is this place?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Last night was quite a romp.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Yeah...?
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
What is happening?
Excuse me, Sir...?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
How long's he been here?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Did you find it boring?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Wow.
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You think she really likes him?
Great line.
Ed, do you want my advice?
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
No.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Hey, he cheated on her.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Who?
What's going on over there?
What is she, at work?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
What does this mean?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Yeah...
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Really?
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh God, this is so weird.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
What's up?
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
I'm making a tape.
You would do this? You would actually --
Why do you do that?
Polish acrobat.
Marcia's living with a singer?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Why me?
No. Two times.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Mm.
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
We don't have foibles.
Sign here, please.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
How'd it go?
Mr. M.?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Tracy.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Here they are.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Where to?
So Tracy?
I want you to do something for me.
I hope so
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
What is it. Tammy?
And when did you do it?
Which door?
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
More this way.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
What do you want, Jim?
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
And she's super-nice
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
How's the left these days?
Merry Christmas.
Somebody hit you?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
I don't know.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
Captain, what do you want?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
What's through here?
Where are we going?
How's it going to look on your report?
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
More or less.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
You're wrong.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
I need to speak to you.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
What's that for?
What are you talking about?
A vulgar term, but yes.
I'm curious about you.
When?
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Have we met before?
Really?  How?
It'll be our secret.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
You've got it on tape?
I'll come straight there.
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that--
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
How?
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
It's a little late for that.
I'll be right back.
Yes?
A police report.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Bobby?
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
It's not true.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Who?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
My suitcase--
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Why would I--
You being audited?
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
Rachel--
I'm gonna fix it.
This conversation's over.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
He didn't.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Listen--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Robert--
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Who won the fight?
It's okay to use the phone.
No.
No, but they took my blender.
No, I--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Was Zavitz in trouble?
It means who's side are you on?
What happened?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
What's this?
We took several photographs, there's no need.
Will you please come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
What do you hate most?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Why did he bring you?
Have you seen Katharine?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Which we've overflown twice.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
David Caravaggio.
Or was it Toronto?
What do you want?
Yeah, for a while.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Well, then ask him his name!
Hello.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Top Hat.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's Canadian.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
No. But he hands them over.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
Certainly not.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
I'll come with you.
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
So he popped the pane?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
We've got to catch him in the act.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
What the hell was that?
That's entrapment.
Nice spot.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Someone was expecting that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Let's do it again.
I didn't mean to get personal.
You're nervous again.
You were afraid of heights?
They moved it.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
The Mask. Where is it?
The eight billion. From them to us.
What's that?
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
The door's the only way out!
What's wrong.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Right.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Five million dollars?
I can put them in a good school.
And get someone to help around the house.
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
And you can't?
Bullshit.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
What now?
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
So what are you thinking?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
What's a demur?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Whose number do you need?
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
No.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
You're around every afternoon?
What're you doing?
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
What's going on?  What are you doing?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
What time is it?
I'm embarrassed.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Dr. Paulsen?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Who's Baxter?
It was .... the Emperor ....
He can do it.
Will he finish what he begins?
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
I can't ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Barks his consternation.
Give me that!
What is thy bidding, My Master?
I have felt it.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
I don't know what he's talking about.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
What are you afraid of?
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
That depends.  Where are we?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
What are you staring at?
I was worried about you.
About what?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
A tremor!
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I don't believe it.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Price?  What do you mean?
But tell me why ...
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
Zira, are you mad?
What are they doing here?
Humans?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Who's that?
Cuervo...?
Where is he?
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Where do I put ashore?
She's in the green.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Where are they?
How do you know all this?
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Good day to you, sir.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
Arthur.
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
At your service, sir.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
It is.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
You are truly magnificent!
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
What honey?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
And you got an invitation.
Phonograph.
I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, I see.
Would you like some more coffee?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Chris MacNeil?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
You wouldn't.
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Well, not while we're in Washington.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Oh I bet he is.
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
All done.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Lieutenant?
You just missed them.
She seemed fine.
Another one. Had your lunch?
You speak Latin?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Miss?
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys!
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Honey ...
Beasley.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
My brother and I. One each.
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Count it.
So we on tomorrow night?
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What d'ya got?,
What do you think?
No, I mean it.
We gotta go, Jack.
So what'd we get her?
So you'll come out, right?
Jack.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Awe inspiring.
Day.  Wednesday.
What's the matter with you?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
What're you doing?
You weren't there.
Fuck you.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Right.
Go ahead.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
So she's got a few sniffles.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
When?
What's the problem?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
It's orange!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
I wear a seven.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Great?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Got another song for us?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Whatcha doin' over there?
How come?
Thanks.
No.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Forget it.
He do that every year?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
My father proposed to my mother in there.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
So ... ?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
From Hurley's?
Jack.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Or reactivated the first one.
Hey, bro ...
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Go on.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Stay away from my family!
What -- what are you doing?
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
The hospital.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
You have kids, Jack?
Thats right. And auto supply...
Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
What are you doing?
Im having kind of a bad day.
Trouble at work?
Damn...
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
You just said everyone needs something.
Miss me, Jack?
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
What're you talkin' about?
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Finger food...?
Something like that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Are you okay?
Why not?
Uh...that babys crying...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
How was the game, honey?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Jack...can we afford all this?
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You look great.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
I want to see you again.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
What the --!
It's about to be a broken face.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed? ... Sue?
No more cracks about how I look.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
What?
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Me like-y.
Stop it.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
What are you doing here?
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
For science.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
What?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
-- and why we need you.
Right, sir.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Just one, General...
Difficult? He's impossible!
Listen...the Heart.
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
A long time, with one man.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
A surgeon might...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
What do you mean?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
We can't take a second more.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
What's that?
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
You have no right to blame Duval --
Looks like quite a way to go...
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Yes, there is.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Who's Jean?
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Uh-huh.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, so we're all set.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
...Dad?
Yah, pretty good.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Geez, you okay, Margie?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah, that's a good one.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
No, that's okay.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
...So?
Yah.
Yah, I guess.
That wouldn't interest you.
What... ?
Better than I've ever been in my life.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Hmm?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
And I saw you practicing this...
Why are you doing this?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
What are you doing here?
What are you talking about?
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
When?
No.
He's not here.
My God, you're shot...
How have you been?
You were in here last Thursday night.
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What do you do, Tyler?
I mean -- for a living.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
I don't... think so.
I don't follow...
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
A nice, big cock.
Same here.
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
What is this place?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
What are we doing?
Tyler...
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
I want to hear the truth.
Why did you do that?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
I'm pulling the green wire.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
One minute.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Excuse me?
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Really?
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
I'm not sure I understand.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
You've made your point.
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
Want me to drive?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Most kids do, I guess.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
What are you doing?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Why's that?
Where did you find this clown?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Invulnerable.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Where?
It's not necessary.
I know...
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Who're you?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
... What?... You don't want to commute?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
No.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Remember. One chorus and out.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
Yes.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Now what?
A quest?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Happily married, probably.
Holdin' my penis...
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Excuse me...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Can I get you anything else?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
What questions?
Where is she, anyway?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Nothing.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Catherine...
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Four or five years.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
Well...
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Who are you?
Do you have a name?
Remember me, from the pool?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Why?
Wha'?
So what girls are over there?
I gotta go take a piss.
The one with the phat ass?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think by Twenty-two.
How does he look up close?
A bad attitude.
Yo, that's my girl.
You sure?
Would you like me to change anything?
Maybe tonight?
Creasy, how old are you?
What? What are you talking about?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Fletch F. Fletch
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Margaret.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
You gonna nail the chief?
Can I get you something?
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Here you are, Doctor.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Read this, please.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
He sighs.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Thanks.
My hero.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
John who?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I bet you do.
Hi.
Can I ask you a question?
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
What are you talking about?
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
You want I set up?
I commend him on his choice.
So you're saying she moved out.
Tell the cops.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Gummy and two cops...
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Just give me a hint, all right?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You'll have it.
Who's Frieda?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Actually, you may take it all now.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
You wish.
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
What an interface!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
It's red, Ford.
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
My axe!
This is boring, guys.
This way...
Ick.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
What are you running from?
How's it going?
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Jazz, we're talking here.
You're that guy, the private eye.
That's cute.  You're funny.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Got a wife named Angie.
Where are you?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Il est en retard.
There'll be someone else.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Why not?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
Toy wit' this will ya.
Same car.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
It was a crematorium.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
What are you saying?
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
How about a little of the King?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
I'm off.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
No, I don't.
What do you mean?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What?
You call your son Little Chief?
Oh my god.
How could this be happening?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
No, not yet.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Are you alright"?
She just died, your mother just died?
Murdered?  Why?
I'll warn them.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
What are we like in...1998?
Yeah, you betcha.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Dad, what the hell is going on?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Go in where?
My father didn't die in a fire?
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Going?  How do you mean?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
What do you mean?
Why did you come back here?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Please... be cool.
I don't see anything.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
What?
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Darren, we better turn around.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Whaddya mean?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Ahh, nothing.
Jason who?
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
...And I said, shut up!
No.  No, it's not...
There...Ya happy?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Yes!
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Well, let's hope not!
Ed...
What's the problem here?
You're talking about my lady.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Tell me.
Lock this asshole up.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
Have you seen Tamara?
Did you hear that?
But I thought...
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
What did you do with Rennie??
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
When did this start?
Yes...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Rennie...??
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
But didn't we know it would happen?
We must abandon.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
That's awful.
Is it safe?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
He carries a gun.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What will we talk about?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
See, Daddy.
Opening night, Lillian.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
People are dependable.
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Who is it?
What do you want?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's a complicated subject.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Because life is good.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
Endearing.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
I am your wife.
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
What'd he say?
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
You're an ambitious man.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
Who is that young man?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
Perhaps some tea?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
Who died?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
Come on--we're taking off.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How the hell did you get here.
I have your samples ready.
Thank you.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
You can wear lifts.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Does it have a name?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
I'll take care of my end.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
I'm in a hurry.
Hello, Doc.
Feel good?
Where do you want to go?
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
How's Estelle?
That's not all of it.
How was it?
That doesn't hurt.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
They checked in.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
No scars?
We better stick here till tonight.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Yeah.
You okay?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Are we going to make it?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
Where we go in1?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
What did you do?  Albert?
What about the brakes?
I made a mistake.
That's not good enough.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Do you?
We went about together.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
How'd you know where I'd be?
Is he coming here?
That's why you waited for me.
You sure about that?
Tell me about the girl.
Was it Albert?
Then he must have pulled her.
Where's that?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Don't know.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Did they give you a rough time?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
So shut up.
Did you sleep well?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Jack! I didn't like that.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Eh? Have a drink.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
You're not seeing me?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
For some sales pro...
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
Starting up.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
We're just "talking" about it.
What?  What?  The leads.
Oh, yes, George.
They're going to come to everyone.
Are you sure?
Were the leads...
The cops?
Why don't you think so?
You have nothing to hide.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
They're inured to it.
Did they...?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
That's great.
Excuse me, fella.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Aaronow...
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
...I only...
Under him?
...you talk to Murray...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
I'm out.
I will close.
Alright.
What are we going to say?
Alright.
Now?  Now?
I wish I could.
No.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Yes.  I hear you.
Why I don't...
How do you know I made it up?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Abso...
I've got the check...
Why?
Shit.
Fuck you, Dave...
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
The monthly interview...?
You're sure?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Rick...?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Yes.
I've got to talk to you...
You don't count Saturday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
I'm...
What?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Guess what the Machine did?
We haven't got a lead...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
Listen to me: They got some of them.
Do you like them?
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
What if we don't pay?
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
The child cannot harm you.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
Hello?
Me too, Tom?
Mikey, I hoped...
Was it a boy or a girl?
And Kay...she's all right?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
They are everywhere!
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Is he related to the witness?
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I had no idea...
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
There are still things I have to do.
You're a considerate young man.
However I can help you...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Says who?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
What's that mean?
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
What're you talking about?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
It's not what you think.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Good morning.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You went to university?
So you had a wife?
So we understand each other?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
What was that about?
Is that really her?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Where's Betty?
By the way, I like the Renoir.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
This is the studio where I paint.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Then the rumors are true?
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
How are you?
What are you doing here?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Fish.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Get out --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You'll leave -- ?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Not my girl anymore
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
Any more, O -- ?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
You sure you're okay -- ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
What era was that -- ?
Come here --
What are you doing here?
You okay -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Shit ...
You know of one -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Call 911 -
What's with the look?
"Mitch?"
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
No ... ?
Unlock your button ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Now... I'm in ...
Hear you roar ...
You remember Junie?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
You need him...
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
How old are you now, Toby?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Which way's out, man -- ?
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
What did you hear about that thing?
Go inside. I'll be right there.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What happened? You okay?
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
Don't worry about it.
Stay there.
The third store down.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Thanks, Chuck.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Is this a bad time?
Is that true?
What's up guys?
Will you take a check?
What class did you say that was?
And what do you see?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes. Under two conditions.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
No.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Thank you.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Yeah.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
Why would he do that?
He married his cousin.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
He won't be a failure!
Sean...
What should I do?
That's very presumptuous.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
What is?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Gotta go with the belt there...
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Five minutes.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Sounds good, where are you now?
No I wasn't...
I bet you have a great family.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
I've never seen your place.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Why not?
Then what are you afraid of?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Ready, Pa?
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
I'd come back--
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Kinda pie y'got?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
How many men?
Can all of you work?
Two and a half cents.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
And you ain't ashamed?
She's settlin'.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Yes, ma'am.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Got any plants?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
I ain't full.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Which ones?
Then who *do* we shoot?
How you get all this money?
Can you pick peaches?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You do not.
You're so funny...
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
So, what are you doing now?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Tell me about yourself.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
You're fucking psycho.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Not the other way around...?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Do you like the people you work with?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Thank you, no.
Hello, Bob.
Well?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
I'm a professional killer.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
What?
You lived in Chicago?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
How long did you live here with your wife?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
No, you didn't.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You buckled up?  You cold?
Did he mention it?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Let's bring your bags inside.
Yes. We're suing.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Where to?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
I'll help you with the coffee.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
You don't seem to upset?
Frank's a good man.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I don't believe it.
Would you let me ride your horse?
She gonna be long?
That's not a question, is it?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
I can't... not yet...
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Hey, darlin'.
You're looking fit.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
You think it's cool?
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Right.
What?
Very impressive.
Ta-da!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Oh wow, we are fried.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
What are you doing?
Up all night again, huh?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Shit! Come on!
Talk to me.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Oh, shit! He got me.
Your slave?
And if I win?
Thank you.
Kate, listen.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Oh, wow, she's great.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Gill.
Hello?
Never fear. I is here.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
What is he doing in here?
Hello?
Phreak?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Thank you.
I'll take you down there.
So?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Shit!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
When did this happen?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Why wasn't I notified?
Yes.
Has he been prepped?
Who you calling?
What the hell did this?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Jamie, what happened?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Jamie!
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
That's all the windows, Dad.
You won't come on too strong.
Get the outside shutters.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Its true, Sheriff.
Oh Christ. Doc...
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
It's over.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
You're going to be late!
Well, are we still on for tonight?
He was standing right here.
Probably Mister Riddle.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Go get me a beer.
Jesus!
Sure...
Exactly what do you need?
They could be.
I'm scared!
Hello.
There's nothing else I can do.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow, it's the red one?
It's French, though.  It really is.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
And you, you-you're going?
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
We could...we could do that.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
...with the affiliates.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Where are you headed?
No!  No...
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Isn't that beautiful?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Great idea.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
No!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
How about something to eat?
Are you sure?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Hmm?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
What's the problem?
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, Jesus!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Yeah.  What?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Ohh!
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Uh-huh.
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, Hannah!
Yeah, can you believe it?
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Hey, what's the matter?
Oh, so loosely.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
It was a terrible evening.
I'd never do that.
So how are you?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, I am.  I am.
No, the reason I ask is--
Oh, I'm fine.
Really?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Oh!
It's all right.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
A reward...
A reward for what?
Well.  Word gets around.
What have they got you doing?
...you...
...why?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You're ready now.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
What's new onna street?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
...are they hard to get?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Why did he come back?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
<u>Do</u> it...
No, no, of course not.
Yes, I did.
..suitcase...locker...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Sir:
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
I am all attention.
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
What is that supposed to mean...?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
I'm an orphan.
Waal...
My husband brought it to me from America.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
...yes.
If your duty requires it.
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
You were given backup....
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
The girl could use some help.
You want another drink, honey...?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Don't shoot yourself.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...my love...
"Because we don't have any money."
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
...<u>sadly</u>...
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
...I feel that...
Tell me why...?
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
...sir...?
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
What are you doing?
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
What else don't you believe in?
Fuck off.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Oh, I have to hear this.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Things are going to change, Earl.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Probably....
There are no stupid questions.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
This knife is filthy.
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
You know what I want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
We on tonight man?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
You two....
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
Bye.
Come on, sit up.
Can I go now?
You have to let me go!
That's coming along well!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
John has fallen in love with me!
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Yeah? You and who else?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
You could say that.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Hey buddy!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
The bathroom!  For two days?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Bill, I got financial problems and...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
You!
Turn that thing off.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
-- hospital.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
About what?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
A man?  Was it a dream?
He doesn't have a temperature.
Neil -- what --
You could have a pool to cool off in.
Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
I thought we'd be happy here.
He wants to see me!
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
Oh God.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Let's follow 'em.
Shit!
Is it a king or a queen?
Tough.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Sing.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
Yes.
Aye?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
Why?
He's in there!
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
You know it's not safe here for you.
Don't leave us, Conner.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
We're fucked.
There is no way out.
We're cool.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Let me come get him.
Give up.
He needs a doctor.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
We can take it with us.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
What the fuck is that?
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Can you identify this man?
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
I need to work out some stuff.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
No one's coming.
What do you want?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
I can't go without Thomas.
What's going on?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Chief, Mikkelson.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
What are you people going to do?
Where are you right now?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
Who are you?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
You want to pay me?
Give me it.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
What was the response?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
The United Nations are still here.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
He did.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
When?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Let's go.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Very soon.
There are no more rooms.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Perfect timing.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
The commander is not here.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
This won't do.
Has Roger spoken yet?
How can we help him.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
A little longer, Paul?
I have to stay.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We have to have a plan.
Can I have your name again?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Rutaganda's place?
Twelve are dead.
What is this about no water?
The staff and guests! How many?
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
Oh, for chrissake --
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
There must be some other way out.
What?
Oh, really: who?
You said that was an accident.
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
What? Deep down inside?
Why not?
Don't think it's even an issue.
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Could we have a word?
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
First time for everything.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
I think...I may have the answer.
What're you talking about?
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
I'll take my chances.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Oh, no.
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
For the love of God....please...?
Something....happened --
What do these ingredients mean?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
My angel!
What about all my other stuff?
Can I have this room daddy?
...set up some more things.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
I think we should do it.
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
Your daughter's been taken.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
What's going to happen?
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Hello?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
I'll boil some water.
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Terri?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
You gonna buy?
What ... What ... ?
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Yes. 53
Really?
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Oh, you read that.
And I'll bring my entourage...
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
What have you been doing?
Catholic girls are scary...
Where did you get this?
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
No, let me!
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Snappy.
...Hello?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
...You know! For kids!
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
...Huh?
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Terrific.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
...Geez.
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...It is?
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...education, were you?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
...Enter the dame.
He don't look wise.
She's got other problems, of course...
...adenoids.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I think you need some help.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
I wish I hadn't heard --
No, Wes.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I suppose so.  Yes.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
An accident at the mill?
What about her?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Right o'.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
The turkey in?
Yeah, that one.
I have no idea.
That this was going to be a key party?
Well?
You're not going to --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Hi dad.
I'm fine dad.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Your toes cold?
But...
What?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Hi mom.
Mikey Williams?
I don't like coffee.
Oh.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Here you are.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
How can you do that man?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Mikey?
Where you going?
You have to follow me?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Charles.
Yeah.
I don't know. How do I know?
Good.
Just after Leland Street.
Nice kid.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I have to get back.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
What about your shoulder?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Good.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
What if someone finds out?
Stuff.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
It was like some big fucking secret!
She used some stupid code name.
No game.
You gave her gifts.
What about him?
Monstrous.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
We want no quarrel with him.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
And yet you knew what I would o.
And if I cut my hair again?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You both did it?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
You know her?
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Let's call that a start.
Did I hear a yes?
Have you ever been caught?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Why do you do this Lestat?
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
It's just a room...
How did you do that?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You loved your wife, surely.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Lestat escaped the fire!
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
I want off this island.
Get lost, you scared me.
That could break the machine.
But, he said he'd try.
Karaoke -- perfect.
What do you mean?
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Deep breaths --
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
...Why?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Ahh, that feels great.
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Rio de Janeiro!
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Good night, Oliver.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
What is it -- what are you talking about?
Woman, what are you doing here?
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Your daughter is ill.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Get that ladder up here.
Stand back.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
You what? To save me?
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
By letting me help you.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
What'd you say?
What did you say?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Where's Mary?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Who is it?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Hi, Daddy.
Daddy!
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Hmmm . . .
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Those Rockefellers!
Now look, did you buy anything?
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Uh-huh.
What'd you wish, George?
I'll take it. And then what?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Where're you going?
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Get on the rocks!
Where're we going?
We're carrying weight.
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Tina!
What is it?  What's there?
We got a helluva tide this month.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Probably.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Hey!  That's my boss!
One what?  Ah-ha!
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Because of today?  The beach?
I'll give notice.
What is it?  What's the matter?
Martin, it could be anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
The wind drift is lateral.
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Right after, the Kids went out?
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
What about me?
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Wave to my son.
Go on, you're tired.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
That macho pompous English --
My imagination isn't that good.
How come?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
And leave me down here???
Yes.  It's faster.
Honey, what is it?
Come on.
I can have them walk backwards.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Let's hope he knows that.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
I like it when they wake up.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
He's a young one.
Give me a ride?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Told you you'd like it.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Gotta sneeze.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Thea....
Can I make sandwiches...?
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
It sure is good to be home....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
No fair, I'm not armed.
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
We don't want any....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
You're coming, aren't you...?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to give up your work....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Flies the plane....
I don't know how....
What's wrong?
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
I hope she's a good sailor....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Matt?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
I wish there was something I could do....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
How many...?
They won't fight with me....
Bad boy....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
Bring her to starboard.
Who?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Half don't...Bring her about....
We lost it....
You getting a reading on them?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
I'll do it, Jake.
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Cow tipping?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
What do you mean?
Because I dislike her too much ..
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Sure.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
What is that?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No.
Oh.
Are you married?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Sorry?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
Has he got your aunt's address?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
You think John would like it?
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Shut up, King Jay ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Now.
I just heard.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Can I help?
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Truth?
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Maybe you should call her.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
It's my fault.
Wait. Where is he?
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I got it.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
You are not allowed to act this way.
What's wrong.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
I'll get you some quick work --
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Why not --
I have to ask.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
Oh, tell the story.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
I'm fine.  What's up?
You...
They do, my brother.
Hi.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
What did you say?
What did you say!
Young adult.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Well what?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
PAUL!
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
I dont know.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
We could co-write a paper.
He used to know me.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Why?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
We're safe!
Hmmm.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You hear something?
What?
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I could come with you.
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
No way.
?!
Head for the roof!
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Ian.  It's guano.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
We have to send someone to look for him!
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
What?  No menthol?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
The movement!
Oh, shit.
Dr. Grant!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Come on, let's go.
I threw up.
Straight-A brainiac!
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Where does he think he's going?
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Can't you stop these things?!
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Dad - - Dad - -
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
Watch how it eats!
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
Well?
I hate trees!
No, but...
I think we're lost.
Hello?
Quite a circus.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
What happened?
Doesnit sleep?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
How do we prove it?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Are you all right?
You work in the insurance department?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
It's my last and final one.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
Are you free tonight?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Your office is the Workmen's --
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
What's the matter?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Jack!
Ann ... Ann!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
What was it, Jack?
Enjoy.  Well --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Why isn't he locked up?
-- We can talk --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
It's kind of late.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
Is that all you have to say?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
That who?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What if she forgets?
All it is is onions and gravy.
I think I'm going to throw up.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Is that really your chair?
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
What did you do when you were little?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Objection.
Objection!
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
A heavy drinker?
I don't recall.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
How's the new job?
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Only can I still see him?
What the hell is this?
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
What?!  She wants what?!
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
What are you going to do?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're sure?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Thelma, if I die--
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
I will buy them for you.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Did you receive the letter?
Who am I?
How big is Tibet's army?
Tell me.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
It is a story, you decide.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
We have enemies.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You, kill me?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
I haven't broken any laws.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
This is a setback.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
I got something on the screen.
Where is he?
Eh.  Fuck it.
What?
And how would we neutralize him?
How big do the bears get?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
That was an awful thing to say to me.
You okay?  Kelly?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Well.  Goodnight.
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
It can't work.
It was... something meeting you.
No.
We set?
Not yet.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
Did you get him?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
You and Kevin.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Miggs has been murdered.
What do you see, Starling?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
They all were.
Horses - and sheep...
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
What did you do?
But you could. You did.
Thank you, Clarice.
Starling.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
He did?
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
My God, Alice.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
What did you say?
Got a reason to stay.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Sir!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Yes.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My colors?
Qui vive?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Be careful with it.
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Your suit, Becky!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
What can we do?
We're on backup air.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
The internal monitors read normal.
What about our quota?
Excuse me, sir...
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
You got money in this tub?
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
How'd you do that?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Are you okay, Jonesy?
It saw us!
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
There are no others.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Dog, I have found the cash!
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Right, his leg's going now.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
That's it all done, we are off.
There's nothing in it!
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
I'll see ya.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
And that does include the amp?
What's left over?'
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
That isn't true.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Well?
Why don't you start with that?
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
I hear they're closing that post down.
You got a cause of death?
Best part of the job.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
350 pounds.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Tanks, huh?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Right.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Hey, Mikey--
Mikey--
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
Treasure hunter?
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
This is an official visit, then--
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Eladio Cruz.
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
I thought you were married!
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
No.
He still living?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
There must have been somebody.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You gonna stay out here?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I should get back.
So what are we gonna do about this?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Uh-huh.
The Republicans?
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Yeah?
Maybe they're not tricks.
Hokey enough for you?
D'Amour.
I don't want him getting in the way.
I'll tell you.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Stuff?
It's okay.
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
Bad show last night?
With what?
Whose is the car?
Philip Swann?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
What's the difference?
What for?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Leave her alone --
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You need an ambulance.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
... no...
Nobody's better off this wav!
That's where we're all going.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
And?
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Hello?
What do you do?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Did I scowl at you?
Yeah? But look at you.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
It's for my daughter.
You think so?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Hello? Yes?
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You smell weird.
Will you please stop smoking?
Its bad for you.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
I'm still shaking.
Seemed...on edge.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
What is it?
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
So...we won?
Two negatives always make a positive.
May I help you?
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
What do you mean?
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Plenty of time.
What can I do?
How much time do we have?
Good seeing you again.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Thanks again for everything.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
Engaged.
Whatever.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
What?
Sorry.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
So how long is this trip?
You might be the only one with a job.
A horse?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I found you someone.
You do.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
What's up with that?
I know.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
One, up.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
You do act different.
Way to hoop.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
Early night for you, isn't it?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Kiss my booty.
I...can't.
Who was that?
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
We're going to get some food.
When did you decide all this?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
You're serious.
You asked me what was missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Zeke.
Yeah.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
Quincy, please...
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Look, I'm busy.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
ok.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Just Jim.
Please, yes.
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I lost my gun.
-- can I get you?
C'mon guys, settle down --
Not enough, what do you want?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
Doc it's Janet.
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
....do you know who I am?
You see?
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
What is that?
I don't know.
Give me your keys, Don.
...ah...
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
Jack.
I think you have the wrong number.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
-- just to clarify --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Kind of.
How long...you think?
When did he go off chemo?
Uh. huh.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You're here.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
Been drinkin' today?
--- What was that?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
-- did she talk to you?
How do we do this, then?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Mmm.Hmmm.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
You coulda been in front --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
God smiled upon us.
No, M'lady.
What -- ?
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
What is it, mother?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
He who is not with us is against us.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
Three days.
Go on.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
Recent hours have been a shock.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Where is Michelle?
Phillippe!
What number, on the first page?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
... Nothing.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
You mind if I ride with you?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Bullshit...
I'll take the south end -
What's this?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Are you alright?
What?  Wait a minute -
Something I don't already know?
What exactly did you see?
And what did you do?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
I'm stranded out here.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
What?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
What have we missed?
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
How much do you know?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Get him to Atlanta.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
When are you coming back?
It's not over yet.
It's getting late and...
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Ride with me.
I'll get my purse.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Do you see?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
Yeah...
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He asked how you are.
Molly?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Me, too. And very erotic...
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Will it keep them out?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I figured I'd ask you...
How did it happen?
How?
Did the girl die?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Do you have the file with you
Do you dream much, Will?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
May I keep the file?
No.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
People love... comedians.
No.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
How long would they let me sleep?
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Ten.
Right...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Popcorn?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Give me the book.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Are you at peace with your family?
Excuse me, Andy...
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Can I help you with something?
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
That's the third white van I've seen.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Five.  Since I've been here.
Dead.  All dead.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
All right --
Give me your phone.
Holy fucking shit!
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
The beginning?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Did you believe in them too?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What's funny?
Hello, Neo.
What the hell is this?!
That I would have to make a choice...
What?
Neo, how did you do that?
Are you all right?
Holy shit!
Operator.
Cypher, I thought --
Tank, you're hurt.
Well, we want good stuff.
May God be with you.
Who's the girl?
So?
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
Panther...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Don't promise...just deliver.
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Shut up!
Don't you move!!!
I think we should see your uncle.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
You getting out too?
Where's the rest?
You're really crazy.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
You know why...with my parents.
I'm sleepy.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
What's the matter with this kid?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Yeah, it's your father's.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Yeah.
Dinner?  Again?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
From the Korean War.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I wasn't going to say --
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
And that?
-- Did I hear 'business'?
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
No, I don't --
I'm not stepping anywhere --
I'm all excited --
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Have we met?
No --
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Whose?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
That's it?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
But I didn't mean to do it!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
You think so?  How do you know?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
'Big'?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Yes --?
Yes?
I came to see you.
Whatever you do.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Where are you going?
You first.
Almost.
Yes?
You're here?
Where are you going?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Well -- I --
The 'coffee shop' --
Susan --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
When you go, I go.
Good morning.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
What's it like where I'm going?
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Hello, Bill.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Joe, don't do this --
I told you to shut up.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
I think you know --
Where are you?  Are you there?
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Don't get carried away.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Where is he?
This is crazy --
You don't know anything about Joe --
Daddy --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
Why?
30.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Condition?
My wife.
How long have I been here?
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
What?
Do you remember me?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Your wife?
What do the police think?
Kill him.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I'm not.
Don't talk about my wife.
My wife.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *
Yup?
Lenny, is that you?
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
Happy now?
Why?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
What's wrong?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Oh, yeah...
Yeah?
My end?
The Keys?
Your father?
I insist.
Packaging?
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
So?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What do we got?
Where?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Go ahead.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Control your men.
Yeah...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
How'd they get onto you?
Who are you talking to?
What...?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
The Statue of Liberty.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
These guys're good drivers.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You want me to leave?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
You got it.
You really want to do business?
Sold. Let's go.
Get lost.
'Figgers.
Yeah.
Twenty months?
It's there!
Anybody bitten?
Dad...I'm...
DAD!
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Got a family back there?
Feeling all right?
Hello, Billy.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Why the suit?
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
You're ayip!
What'd the Prosecutor say?
What lawyer?
Hey, you can't...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
There's some weird shit here.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Look, I showed you my badge...
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
What do you-?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Do you think we did the right thing?
Metaxonycha Godmani.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
This wing configuration. I've never...
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Sure.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
What's it about?
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Done?
You want me to burn my book?
See, isn't this nice?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Set what up?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
What about a bee...?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Don't talk to me like that.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
What things?
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Newspapers?
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I thought you were over it.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
On what.
You won.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
There she is.  I got visual.
What are you doing here?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hola..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
What did you think you were doing!
No.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
'Terrorists?'
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
I don't.  No exactly.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Roger that.
So what did he say?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
Come on!
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Only four more cars.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
What are you going to do?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
The message is for Job.
I didn't say that.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire.
Yes.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
What makes you trust me?
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Mm - Hmmm...
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Would you remove your hat please?
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
What problem?
I guess.
I usually am.
You got it.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Here.  Ti amo. 
It's temporary.
I got it done.
You're my father.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Son of a bitch!
I've got you.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
What are you talking about?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm here!
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
You've gotta get outta here.
No, I'll tell him.
Will you marry me?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
What about the wedding?
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What the hell happened to you?
Are you drunk?
That's it! That's the reason!
Can I get another one of these?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Do you have a girlfriend?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Temperature's dropping.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
How do you know she is a witch?
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Halt!  Who goes there?
Get away!
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Who are the Britons?
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Oh!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
What, "is"?
None shall pass.
Then you shall die.
Look!
Hello.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
What with?
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Yes, Lord.
Well?
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your favorite colour?
To seek the Grail!
Why?
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
But, Father.
How?
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Sir Galahad!
Sir Gawain.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Aye, but will they?
She'll get over it.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
The place is a mess.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Mama...
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
No.
Do you hunt?
So...?
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
We took a nip of whiskey.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Is that not enough?
This is my good John Brown.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
What did he want?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Mrs Brown.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Has he been hurt?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Why is he not here?
What's the riddle?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
It turned itself back on, Nick.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
We can't reach that!
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Go for it.
Then we'll go home?
Mom?  You're alive...
But I don't understand...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
Yes...what is it?
So, what did they say?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
I...
No, I don't.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Was anyone hurt?
What is it Rita?
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
No.... I don't...
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Don't stop!
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Wally Brown.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Palmdale.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Is that it ?
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
So what do we do ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
How long till the room fills ?
He hired you to build this place ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
I don't get it.
Just stop it. End it here.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
It's fine thanks.
Where ?
Don't.
Well ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
How long till the drug wears off ?
Will he make it out ?
Was that the Old Man ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Are you okay ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Totally.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
I'm glad you're here.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
That's okay.
What are you staring at?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
This is really very nice of you.
Hi there...can I help you?
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
There's water in your bathroom.
Don't wake up Vada.
Thanks....
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
I think it's cool.
You are weird. Let's just go.
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
It's not his fault!
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Wow!
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Maybe.
I think this place is just fine.
So what's wrong?
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Really?
He's a great poet.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Of what??
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Keep your voice down!
They're dead?
Stiffs??
I need the job.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Yeah.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I haven't danced in.....
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
How's it going chef?
Ahem.
The money?
When??
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
No, no no....
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Please.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Who's that?
No.
Sure.
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
Where's Daddy?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
At what?
No, I'm going home.
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
Is that your Dad?
Here.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Hi Vada.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Close your eyes.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
You don't miss much.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
I was devastated.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Ben Gay.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I did what I came to do.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
But I can't be dry.
What else did he tell you...
Don't you have to be somewh...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
But he always says...
He'll see right through it.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Well, you're a little early...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
What happened?
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
It's not just a gag, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Then why are you listening to her -
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Barbara Jean.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
You want anything?  A drink?
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
He's my father.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
What's this?
How do you know?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I don't know his first name.
I don't think so.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Well, can you tell me why?
Do you like him?
Yes. Who's this?
Yes.
I'd really like to see you.
Hello.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yes.
Hello. John Triplette.
What for?
What National TV...?
We just got a gold record.
I'm Opal.
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He is to a lot of people.
I know a couple.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Ryan O'Neal.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Naw, she don't mind.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
How come you never talk?
Say something.
You ready, Donut?
Manson beat you.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Sorry about that.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Describe Mallory.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Just wait one fucking minute.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
And where do you keep Mickey?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Rollin'...and speed!
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ya know, I was.
Want me to come?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Any other family?
Haven't seen you around, have I?
In Birmingham.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Hell!
How come you stay 'round here?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Ain't your fault.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Surprised?
What about that girl?
Hmmm - good coffee.
Don't look so scared.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
How come you keep askin'?
Don't deny me, Duff.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Don't do that!
You heard me!
Just get her drunk.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
I'm Duff.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Don't be too hard on him.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Come on, Will.
Got a thick feelin' here.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
Easy...
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, well it's working.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Yo.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
You're late.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
What about the route to the core?
Hello, Case.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
On a good run... yeah.
It sounds like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
He projects with neural implants.
Shit...
Who?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
What?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
YOU DID.
Senorita Josie.
Cuuuute!
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Oh my god.
Rob's?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Better person than I.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
What!?
I love the way she writes.
Sure, why?
This seat taken?
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Yoooooow.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Yes.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
<i>                      I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
Yes.
Why not?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
Help me with this thing!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
What's all this.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
So, you feeling anything?
Any ghosts in here?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
Hi, guys.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
You like gymnastics?
That was different.
What's that?
Nancy!
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Crossed over?
Anything?
Oh God.
Ms. Thompson.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
Nancy...
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
What was that?
Somebody else is out here.
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
No!
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Okay.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Cartwright.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Oh please sod off.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
You were saying...
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Can I have your autograph?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Right -- want another one?
Max.  This is Anna.
Do you ever masturbate?
Hello.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I wouldn't go outside.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Are you sure you...?
How was she?
Excuse me.
Bad news.
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Billy?
Tell us about it...
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Yes, ma'am...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
I'm not finished yet.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
What's your name, buddy?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
So long suckers.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
What is it, kid?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Say it again.
In there.
What for?
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
Did to me?
Lobotomy!
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
It doesn't help him.
I'm busting outta this place.
I'm the coach!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
I don't, Doc...
Time out!
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, buddy?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hey, how ya doin'?
What are they?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Hi.
Yeah!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
What?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
...has a prior commitment.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
You...
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
That's not the point.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
He's out by the pool right now.
Do you want me to do it?
So.  You found him.
Hey--
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Yes.  I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was hoping for the real thing.
I'll look forward to it.
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, what are we waiting for?
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Why don't you ask him?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Thank you so much.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
And then what, Faith?
That was really sweet...
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Peter found him?
Maybe I can change him.
He's a jerk.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
What about Larry?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
She what?!
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Working hard?
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mmhmmm.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Terry...?
What makes him so special?
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I'd better go in.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like that one?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
What are you crying for?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I don't rate it.
Pigeons... .
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, for God's sake.
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
But you've got to listen to me.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Nice fellows.
What do you think?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Really?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
You ought to go home and take care of that
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
Leave her alone, I tell you!
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
She was?
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
The moon is almost gone!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
You better hope there is.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
What do you suppose for?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Adele?  You in there?
I'm not dressed.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Oh, man.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Outside of that.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Yeah, why?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
How much for your company at chow?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Boy, it stunk in there.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Think I could have them back?
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
You really wear that suit.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
You're not dumb.
Wait in the car.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
There were others.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Glenn, take the exit.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
How's it going?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
You're a fighter?
That's not Maurice?
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
...the fuck is this...
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
It's Germans!
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
I didn't mean it.
We gotta face some facts here.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Danny...
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Yeah.
How's everything?
Sorry.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
What's your name?
Danny's not coming?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
I have'na been able ta --
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Carol!
The only one?
I'll call you Later.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Lucky lady. Hi.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
You drive like a maniac!
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What are you doing here?
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Are you for real?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Damn that Charlie I
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Quiet today?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
You look exactly the same.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Okay. I promise.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What will they be made of?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
I came to say goodbye.
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
Is something wrong?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Why not?
How long have you been here?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Do you really think so, Andy?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
I'm not going to die.
I'm ready...
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Big trouble.
How did they find out?
PARRTYY!
You think I'm uncomfortable...
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
A regular all-American guy?
Are you a good lawyer?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Do you take risks?
What kind of movies do they show there?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
In some situations.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Leave that.
A homosexual encounter.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
How many gays do you know?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
He was doing a great job.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Riddick? What the hell are you --
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
You'd die for them?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
And him?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Well? Is it just the pump?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Frightening thought.
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
New Mecca....
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
I'd rather piss glass.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
'I am not a missing link.'
No.
Which direction?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Can we take a dip?
We got off at the wrong stop.
She comes along too.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Of course.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Listen-
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
He's moving his fingers!
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Yeah?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
What we got here a crusader?
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
No thanks?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Dance?
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Why?
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Me?
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
FLorida?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
What's this in favor of?
What?
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Information.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
A little something on account perhaps?
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
No suicide.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
But you still think she's innocent.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
Of course.
I told you she's just..
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
To Ann.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pt.
Thank you.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Good.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I thought it was tremendous.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Why not stay?
Did she talk about me?
Not here.
And the Argies.
You approve!
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Hold those rights.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Hello.
Oh, I see.
What period?
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Not bad.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
And that's why you never went pro?
Friends of yours, huh?
Where's Roach?
Why should I?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Who's the girl?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What's goin' on?
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Any sign of the hostages?
What have you got in mind, General.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
What's he got?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
There's no way you could know that.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
No, you look like a hooker.
New York.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Room service.  What do you drink?
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Good morning.
This isn't a date.
Real genuine guy.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
But don't they have it in English?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
What did you do to him?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Why do you want to know?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
All this because of that whore!
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
You bullshittin' me?
Oooh, I love those.
I'm just going to my room.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
What's your name?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Then you would use your--
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Are you looking for something in particular?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I fear I'll never see you again.
But what if something happens to you?
Can you move at all?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Why is that, do you think?
Why should that make such a difference?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
I only dog paddle.
Faster!
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- Fezzik, please --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Inigo.
Yes.
Westley's only faking, right?
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Thank you for everything.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
How old were you?
Inhale this, but do not touch.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Then make your choice.
-- get back, witch --
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
"Of the silvery mooooon,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Here, don't panic.
But that's cheating!
Yes, what?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
To failure!
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do it!  Do it!
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Of Siegfried...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
No.
No.
What?
Of course not.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She stole some money.
Forty thousand dollars.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Please!
Is something wrong?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Sorry.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
For what?
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'm looking for a private island.
You should... mind it.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Is anything wrong?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
We have a problem.
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Barefaced.
I'll get your bags.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
Yes.
Did you wish to see someone?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What are you going to do?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Your father?
Did you hear?
The child!
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
Did you? Where?
Why didn't you eat last night?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
What! What are you talking about?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Are you giving me this straight?
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
No kiddin'?
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
I told you he was a sore.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
That's what I said.
You weren't going with her?
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Yep. Everything settled.
Could you?
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
Of what?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
You better quit that.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Of course not!
You were up late last night, Brother.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
So am I.
What's goin' on?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
I am not being brutal to her!
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Rose, what are you doing up?
You're so sweet.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, it was a silly question.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
I see. Outside it.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Oh, no, ma'am.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Jiminy Christmas.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
The booze.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
What day is it?
Gimmie a butt.
Birth control's important.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
It doesn't say that.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
General Jim Beam, then.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Alright?
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
You need a doctor.
Let's get this thing done.
Been waiting long?
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
You always did have style.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
What did he say?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
Oh!
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Tell me.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
You promise you won't tell?
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes Brad.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
Hello.
You're OK by me.
Wheeling
No no no, no no.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Some people are very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...Guess.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
It's only temporary.
It's okay.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I always knew you was pretty.
Like?
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Is everything all right?
...I can't beat him.
Paulie, please --
...Paulie. Stop now!
You busted?!
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
Hear she's retarded.
...That's an old one.
This a con?
That's it? -- Completely?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
...What?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
More like thirty.
Did ya win?
'Bout an hour ago.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Please, kid.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
How am I doin'?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Ya always in a bad mood --
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
How ya feelin'?
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Ya really like her?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
So altruistic.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
You shot Roger.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Wrong number?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Romeo! Romeo!
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
I'll not endure him.
Good marrow, father!
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
How well my comfort is revived by this.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Goodnight.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
That dreamers often lie.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Pink for flower.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Nurse.
Do you have it?
Why did you do that?
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Do you have it?
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
We'll die if we stay here!
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Then I guess we're set.
Long enough to shoot back.
You should watch what you eat.
Sorry I'm late...
Cigarette?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
He's going back.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
I'm going with you.
Alright, it's done.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You were behind the door?
They don't have the package.
Give me a cigarette.
I'm not here very much.
Not here.  They might see it.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Would you stop with that...
You have to stop doing that!
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
I told you, I quit.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Do you have the tape?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
We don't know that.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I don't know...
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
I can't do that.
That's not what I mean.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Do you have everything?
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
We've got to go now, then.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Whoa, Earl!
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
What's wrong?
OK.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
You're worth every last penny.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
So do I.
Why does that bother you?
Yeah, I've seen him.
What makes you say that?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Don't you have to be here?
Sheriff Hogan --
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
About what?
It was going to be a surprise!
We're out of here.
Oh Jesus Christ...
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I didn't know you were coming.
Did they ever find out who they were?
That's great Earl!
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
What the hell is that?
Winner!  Four, winner!
The band has been playing over an hour.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Yeah, that's right.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Oh, you American?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Hello.
It sounds impossible --
It's a long story.
What's she doing?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Fine with me.
Fine.
I think we should stop talking.
What about a little king pao chicken?
Hello, Benjamin.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
No you didn't!
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
First class.
I could use a little vacation.
Do you still have the bills?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Feds asked for me?
Beach Boy.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Where were we?
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Are you OK?
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Jesus...what do you want?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
Any demands yet?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
What?!
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
I do.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
Yes.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
And in a "V".
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Maggie!
Look, he's running after her.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Yeah.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
I'm a work in progress.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
Lost!
That's called changing your mind.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
I'm going to kill myself.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Nope.
You take the microwave?
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Am I what they had in mind?
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
Is that all right with you?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You go.
What's with you?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Yes.
I love that dream.
It's a sign --
What are your plans in New York?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Magic.  It was magic.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Where's your mom?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
It is not --
You'll see.
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Sure.  Looking good.
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
Bye bye blackbird.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
What are you doing up?
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Have you seen my wallet?
What's wrong with Annie?
Do you like it?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Why are they singing, Mama?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
What were they saying? About you? In there?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Where are you going?
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
You know I don't think that.
Forgot what?
Where's your mama?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
What?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Ride 'em cowboy)
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
I can't.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Who is it?
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
Why not?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
So, why'd you want to see me?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
By not disgracing her memory!
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Not bad.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
You want to do this some other time?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I've got a hot one.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
What're your taking down?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
He knows somebody ratted him.
We know what's going on.
What's on the other end of this thing?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
You mean like the Donner Party?
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
We're in business.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Last I knew.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
How about that jeep?
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
It looks like a Renoir.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
I wonder where they're going.
GO!
What about the company?
Fresh out.
Uh, Captain...
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
So, where are you from?
How fast?
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
I'll take the whole set.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
I'll be in my office.
But you never had a first date.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd, it's us.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Goodnight.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Honey!
Busy?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
So we can finally talk?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
So what's your job this summer?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
No.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't think so.
Yeah.
Okay, what did we just decide?
Yeah you do.
Is this because of your dad?
You do?
Yeah.
The guy with the Datsun?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Thanks Lloyd.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
No, really.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
My car.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
Should I stay?
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
It's bad business.
You want these people.
What do I got for you?
What others?
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Better this month than last?
What?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
We know that, son.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
I could use some therapy.
I think he's doing Dolly.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Where's Sid?
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Who are you?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
I dont know.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
I've been waiting for you, baby.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
I hate scary movies.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Who?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Detective Kincaid?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
They found another note?
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What about me?
You're not a detective.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What's your point?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Who's phone?
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Gale he's got Dewey!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
It is in my script.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
WHERE?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
I didn't kill anybody.
How'd you do?
Duh... that's quick.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
I thought she was dead.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
What are you doing here?
Jesus, SHIT!
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Sshh... it's okay.
Who did you call?
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
I don't know.
What do you want?
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Don't do this. I can't...
What door am I at?
What brings you out to these parts?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Should I be worried?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Jesus...
What? What?
About thirty seconds.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
How's the book?
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Hello?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
Yeah.
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Do you believe this shit?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Who?
No way.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
What's so exciting?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I... I don't follow.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
It could be nothing.
It's my wife.
Well?
How's that?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
Did you read them?
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
I wish I still thought like you.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
Does this make it with you?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
What are you going to say?
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Where's the victory?
You knew I'd say yes.
You know he's fucking us.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
How's California?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
Another one, eh?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Got a warrant?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Yes, sir.
What you want me to call you?
You all right, Ethan?
Why?
That don't make 'em kin...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Hey... the fuse.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
What?
How did you get me out of there?
No, I've never seen him before.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Mrs. Straub!
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Oh
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
Are you writing?
The title?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Interesting.
So now you are free to love
It's a comedy.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Another little problem.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
"Good morrow, cousin."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Not ready? Where is she?
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Your Majesty.
Master Shakespeare
Like you, I found him not at home!
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Can you love a fool?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
And that was only my first try.
You would not leave me?
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
There is time. It is still dark.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
No, sir.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
All right, just a few questions.
I was trying to educate you.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
You think so?
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I won't be able to.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
Nothing.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
-- which is --
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
You know we're right.
We have to talk.
We could put it somewhere.
Aren't you going to answer it?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It's about the burglary.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, I've never seen them.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
We already know. All about it.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Writing seems easy.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Your watch.
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Thanks a lot.
Why not?
I don't want to talk about it...
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Did you hear me?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Yeah, it is.
You are.
You do it.
What's wrong?
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
Am I entertaining you?
-- what?
-- Jesus --
Why?
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
Yeah!
I have to see you.
I just... who what?
Maybe you don't even like children.
George.
When is that, George?
Jill says nothing.
What business meeting?
Now, Jackie --
Well that's something.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Baby, don't do this --
... well I'm glad you told me.
What're you here for?
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
It's good you want to do something, George.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
... she's very upset...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
What do they look like?...
Sit down.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
What took you so long?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
How much?
What?
I would say so, yes.
C'mon.
-- Yesss?
Egypt?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Johnny!
I'm terribly sorry.
Good for you.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
Do you have children?
Do you have something against traveling?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Are you having a good time?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
I won't make any noise.
Danny?
Red Rum.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Because he hides.
Please...
What sort of injury did he have?
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
No, we don't mind.
Bill, how do you do?
Sure is.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
I'm Jack Torrance.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Can I tell you kids something?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Please, Uncle Al.
Are you all right, Marty?
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Your mom's not around, is she?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
What if I say no?
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But how?
SING!
But I'm fearful!
How come?  Sister?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What? 
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
Oh, girls.
This prom is a real drag.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Is this... choir practice?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Three years.  A rookie.
You have to help me
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Oh my Lord!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Miss Van Cartier.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Yeah?
Really catching on.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
You saved my life.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
Ten flights?
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
I just need a few more weeks,
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Hey, girls.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
A nun?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
Right.
Get her!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
Peace on Earth.
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
I lied.
She's a nun, Vince.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Do you have these persons' wills?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
Very few, if any.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
What is that you wear?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
It's spectacular.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
What good is this?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What are you doing?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
Use caution.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Can I help you?
Well, I guess it's all good.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
You know what, by God?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
How come?
How did your mama die?
Well, I hate him.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
What do you mean?
Why?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
Huh?
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Do me a favor, will you?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
But they're all the same.
Slow down, huh?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Like what?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Lovely.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
It's for you.
So I can get my job back.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
No thank you.
I figured he had a right to know.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Thomas.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Mostly what.
Here and there. Around.
Eight-thirty.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
And?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
None.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
It is.
Closer to eight.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Robbed.  He was angry.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Yes.  Initially.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
And what's that?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Okay, doll.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
DAPHNE?
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Oh, he does!
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
I'll say there is!
That's some nerve!
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
Josephine -
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
I was it.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
I forgive you.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
I don't like no witnesses.
Oh?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
No, we couldn't!
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got time off for good behavior.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
Brains aren't everything.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Happy days.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
What makes you so sure?
Thank you.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Your face is familiar.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Yeah.  Real hot.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
You collect shells?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
One of whom?
You heard her - yes.
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Where's your shell collection?
See?  Nothing.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
And who runs it?
Refresh my memory.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Christ, Amy.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Does Kat know?
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
I thought you said you were crap.
Ill just check into a hotel.
Whats his problem?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
What color are my shoes?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
What is?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
Its hard to explain.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah. You?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You didnt have to do that.
Oh, no. He told you.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
It's cold, Daddy!
We didn't find Sounder yet.
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Mornin', son...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
What's in there, David!?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Ready to go, Mama!
You got two shirts on?
Who's winning, Mama?
Who is they?
Did you see Daddy?
Poor creature...
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Good night, Mama...
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
What's wrong with him, David?
What's wrong, Nathan?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
What did he want?
There, you see?
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Mrphmmmph!!!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Mom...
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
You've got a stupid accent too.
Mkay.
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Kyle?!
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm!
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
What's the password?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Nowhere.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Does it say what the clitoris is?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
I am the dark master!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
You know I do.
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
NAZIS!!
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
What is it?
Got it.
Getting drunk is no solution.
Evening.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Where the hell did you come from?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Barnes?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
It's getting hard to breathe...
Really?
He certainly is polite.
Yeah.  We did it.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Do you want some advice?
What's that?
I'm not going with you.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
What the hell is that?
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
You know, Elvis bowled.
How do you turn this thing off?
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
My poor baby!
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Who's there!
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top. 
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
He's not here.
Uh...over easy.
This is a vicious cycle.
Whoa.
Mind if I cut in?
Can I ask you something personal?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
I can't tell you, Theo.
Where are you going?
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Fuck plan C!
Fletcher!  Now!
Norman!
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Direction's east coming!
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
What have you been told so far?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
They pressurize us with helium.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
What for?
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
So how do we get it open?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
A half a mile long?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
I'd also like it noted --
Look at this.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
How can he be missing?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
Because when we get down there --
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
You're next, Norman.
Where'd this come from?
Beth --
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
It's not worth the risk.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
But I don't know how --
What's the matter?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Three to six hours.
Doesn't say.
You ever given an injection before.
Not believing you.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
But --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Beth, stop it!
Stop it!
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Well, what's your theory?
Then what is it?
Just in time, too.
What?
You holding up alright?
Don't be defensive.
Our answer.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
I don't follow you.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
What is that?  That noise?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Wisconsin's your answer.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
Hold on.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Well, if it's a discharge --
Beth and Harry?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Squint harder.
What was it?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
No, not anymore.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
You saw through me?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
What is it?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
This isn't going to work.
Watch it!  Move back.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Mobile Infantery rules !
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Johnny, wait...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
She's flying starships !
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
You're late.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
I'm gonna miss you.
What happened to your hair ?
You don't look very happy to see me.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Which way ?
What ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Uh, look, Diz...
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
C'mon...
Hey, Diz...
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Oh, my, what's that ?
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Let's go.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Disclose the information.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Then you acted properly, of course.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Hello, Ilia.
Was he difficult?
Time to impact...?
Mr. Spock?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
We're losing the pattern...!
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
What answers?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Dock control reports ready, sir.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Nope.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
You like my play.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
I...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Goodbye.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...such a pleasant sound.
Hi.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
About <u>conflict</u>...
<u>How</u>...?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
What happened?
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
It's for your finger.
Hi.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Yes.
What's the scene...
What've you got?
...yes.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
Pelting down out there.
...and we could get up every morning...
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But it'll stop the movie.
Hi!
I've been thinking.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
What courthouse?
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
How old are you?
Nice town that you've got here.
Are you all right...?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
You guys had better leave us a...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Izzat so?
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
Look.
You have to hide.
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I know that...
...I can't do it, Wally...
...I...
And you know what...?
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Kiss my ass.
Doug...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
Hi.
I...
And what was it you wanted to say?
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
I had a witness I would.
Not now.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
We're out of money.
I don't getcha.
Hi!
<u>Siddown</u>!
Did you bring Bob's weights?
<u>Stop</u>...
Marty...
I don't got the money.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
She coulda done better than him.
You think so?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
I'd rather be with Mommy.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
This is my house too!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
What if he's kidnapped?
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
So we'll...radiate some more?
That's necessary, huh?
Because you don't really seem here.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
It's temporary.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I don't know wh...
You bet you are.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
I really look like shit.
And I'm going to win.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Thanks for coming out.
You're lying.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
They're my kids.
I needed some time away.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Don't ever say that.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mom?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
It's over there.
...gger.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
I believe it.
That's too bad.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
That's good.
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Scooby?
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
Is he with the girl?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What now?
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
I insist...
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
Well?
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Where are you trying to reach him?
What's the meaning of this?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
So what?
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Yes!
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Why do you think I ask?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
You know the regulations well, Major.
What shall we drink to, sir?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
To peace on earth, Major.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
Yes?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
Then this is it.
Just the missiles.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Shoot, Lothar.
Primary bomb is live.
He's dead, all right.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
That's the point.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Forget it.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
We are?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
How long were you in there?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Typical male.
Hey!
Yup.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
A long, long, long, long, while.
Sure.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
I know, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Ah, you know people there?
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Really?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
He paid you man.
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Yeah. So, what about you?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Jeff, stay there.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
What?
Please?
Oh! Trim it!
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
No, I don't.
Where are you going?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Yeah, I crash there.
Yeah, they could be songs.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Is that your driver?
Yeah?
No, she was just sitting there?!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Jesus, Jeff.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
No, I'm going.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Your manager?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
The fuck not?
What?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Another sex dream?
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
No.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
I'm sorry.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Hat-trick?
Kansas!
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Hello?
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Really...
Your help.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Good party.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I didn't.
I had a teacher like that once.
With a wildly beating heart.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I was afraid of that.
What about all those ideas you had?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
May I say you smell real special.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Her own movie theatre.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Well?
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Keep it.
Go away.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
You are not dressed properly.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
How is she?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
You made her a star?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Got a title?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Home?
At last. Ultimate Power.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Don't leave me.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Like it?
We can't do that.
You're not afraid are you?
Away. From you.
And now?
Before you go...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
What are you making:
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
No thanks. You go on.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
What's it like?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
Goodbye...
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You know what's the problem?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Peanut butter and jelly.
I can never get a way from it.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Wipe 'em out?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Is this whitemail?
A computer.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Can you do that?
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
What about you?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Okay? Goodbye.
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Are you okay?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I do?
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
It is kinda romantic.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
I want to.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
"They?"
I'll try to remember that . . .
Gee. But --
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
So --  I hope you like it.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
You are master of all you survey.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
But he's never there.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
Not...gray.
Know what?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
So I've noticed.
Again???
I'm going to bed.
What do you suggest, my dear?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Do you like pink?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Is that real enough for you?
Sort of.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
Yes...fine.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
But you said...
I...don't think so.
Alison.
My name is...
Hi, Nicole.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Because it's what we have to do.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
What do you mean?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
You hate it.
What happened to summer?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
No.
Nicole?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Dolores.
Why?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I'm a lawyer.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
What's so funny?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
What are you up to, Nicole?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
Uh huh.
I know Steve.  No.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
And who's feet is she on now?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Are you listening?
Talk to her, Sidney...
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
I thought he would.
Could this be that boy?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Avidly.  He was staring.
Back?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
What would you think of me if -
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
But...
Who else phoned?
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
You ought to be used to me by now.
If that's for me, tear it up!
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
Did you now?  On which bounce?
I didn't do anything!
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Please... let... the kids... go...
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Excellent.
Torque wrench please.
Alriight!!  My man!
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Easy money!
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
Ready to rock?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
Where do you stand on all this?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
What's that mean?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
I made no deal!
Did you call someone you knew?
Sure.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
Show me.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
And you're from the future too?
Just let me go.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
I caught one, back there.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Let's go.  Time to move out.
What's that?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
So much pain.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
I can help you...
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Here's her driver's license.
Call her.
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Excuse me, I need to explain...
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
Alright... okay...
I'm sorry, about this...
I'll wait.
This is C.R.S.
You deserted me.
You're the one who started running.
That's classic.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What the fuck are you... ?
Guess you missed it.
Nicholas...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
I have to get to the airport...
About me?
You need anything?
Who?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
What?
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
How long will these take?
Physical?
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
I need the police.
Thank you.
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
What the fuck... ?!
Attractive...
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
Like she smelled it too?
I don't know.
What happened?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Yes.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
What do you do?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
That's so sad.
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
Italian.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
How they goin', kid?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
CQ what?
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
That was one of them?
What are we standing on?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
How d'you mean?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Disappointed.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
Who remembers.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
There is?
You know her?
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
Exercising my visitation rights.
I miss my kids.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Ann--
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
...Ed, I...
...You know... who *who* is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Please, Ed.
What kind of man *are* you?
Where you going?
Should I... should I tell you why?
No thanks.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
...Did you make that up?
That was quite something.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'll go down and speak to him.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Forget it!
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
The body?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Lieutenant --
I smell it.  It's here.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
I'm coming with you.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
What do you do?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Jesus, what is this?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
What kind of egg is it?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
What was it?
Is there another way around?
For what?
We have to try and draw it off!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
Where exactly?
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Who are you?
How can they have a child?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Stay where you are!
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Who were you talking to?!
How's your hip?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
You got it.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
What do you do?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
No, they don't.
How can this be?
Yes.
Who called this meeting?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Do they know?
You looking for him for some other reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You know my work?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
I'll know soon enough.
You didn't know my father --
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
It's like jelly.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What are my choices?
This virus -- it... 
Been where?
What? What's wrong?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
What is it?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
More concerns than that?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
What then?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
That went well.
I heard Julia and John got married.
You liked him?
Oh no... No you don't.
Nervous?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
We proceed assuming she is.
You sure you want to go through with this?
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Who are you looking for now?
When...what did you do?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
How do you know?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Can you tell me whose...
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
See much of him before that?
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Do you see what that means?
This is where he vanished.
Calloway!
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Win what?
It's a military hotel.
Shall I go over there, sir?
...his number.
You do!
Come upstairs a moment.
Heard of Harry Lime?
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Did the police believe you?
...the best way one can, you know.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Already gone.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Harry...
...this time.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Richard - I saw a fin!
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
I think so too.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
You think?! Based on what?
What's a fascist?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
When can I see you?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Those aren't Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Explain it so I can.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
I don't do that.
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Hello...?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What about chicken?
Isn't it true?
Who knows what that is?
Shut up. Fuck you....
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
You can't say that....
It's Friday....
Adam Sandler.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
So what?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Johana, am I boring you?
I tell you she's mine!
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
And just where are you from?
Well, good night, then...
... It's a comfortable place.
Dollars.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
No.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Good night.
He doesn't like us.
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I'd better get back now.
How can you tell it's a female?
You want to lie down for a while?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Why don't you ask me?
Will he understand Spanish?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Want to get a drink?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
So don't show a picture.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Mom! We're eating!
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What should I charge?
Then what do you do?
Sure, I like my leopards
I'm sick.
I want him to lock me up.
What's left of him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
The death card - -
Oh, that's so interesting!
It's about the leopard.
It could be a man.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
To the eye? Like other men.
That was unfortunate.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Clo-Clo?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
	As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
And she waited here for him?
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Thats right.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Can it be that easy?
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Are we understood?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Are you all right?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
When did you get back?
Black suits you.
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
What do you suggest?
The word for those things is croissants.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Im calling about the puppies.
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
So, what are you looking for?
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
What company?
You sure you passed on my message?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Must I speak to you in French?
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Vous tes Franais?
At what time will you be available?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Whats the date?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
When they realise Im missing...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
I would like some fresh straw.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Jeanne, stop it!
Good.
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
To be killed in battle?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I am ready now...
One day you will.
We have to press home the attack!
But that was her order!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
And?
Dead you're worthless, darling.
God defeated the English, not me.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
Were you baptized?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
What were you doing when the voice came?
The voice was in your cell?
Please... may I have it back...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
... and what... what did he say?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
My captains have sworn their support.
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Clear?
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I... I never lied!
My... visions...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Beautiful.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I don't want to wait for his call.
A beauty. Who is she?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
I need help.
How long have you been married?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
And suppose they take the table away?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What did you pay him?
What are you reading?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
What the hell are you doing?
What's your work?
What about you?
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Which mountains are those dear?
She looks tired.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Yes, why not.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
No, words. You have never heard words?
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
He's given it to us.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Yeh, go ahead.
You got a bag or somethin?
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
I'm out, Johnny.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You just worry about your end, kid.
No signs of trouble?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
What's the problem?
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
How ya doin'?
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
You weren't hired to miss him.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Yes.  He admitted it.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
How are you?
I can't.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Mother!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
You know, we know each other.
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Dead?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Have you got a pistol permit?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
You've been there?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Are you kidding?
Shut up.
I said he hadn't written me.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
I think we may as well sit down.
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
I know.
What are you going to do?
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I can't! I haven't got it!
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Why tell me?
You might have mentioned me first.
By the way, how is your father's side?
What hit me?
What are you going to do with it?
I'd like to see you work.
But it's Christmas now.
You're a fine watch dog.
Hello... send him up.
Is that another Christmas present?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You bet I wouldn't.
Back to California
Wynant's body?
How long has he been dead?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Why not?
Who do you think did it?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Well, congratulations.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
What's it say?
He's not so--
Where'd they go?
Missile!
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
So you can give us away?
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
Take the binoculars.
They'll shoot us!
What?
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Where you going?
You're going to be fine.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
This.  Whatever it is.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
Get up and dig.
It's just a mongoose.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
First Wes, now you?
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
Getting cold.
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Oh, God...
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
You get it yet?
At-at-at-at-at.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
We have to go back.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
Control ON.
What did you get?
When?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
Are you all right?
What's going on....what are you doing?
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
Well?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
What was that....
Just look at all those people.
Yes
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
And you are...?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Coffee, Mike?
What're you talking about?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Only once, at Redstone.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Yeah, another round thing.
Whadaya mean?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Jesus...
Then why tell me?
What's the matter?
Alex, please-
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
What about the ballistics report?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
What the hell's going on?
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Make an appointment.
P.E.T.N ...
Device.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
So what're we looking for?
Yes, sir.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Yes, Baron.
I want to see-- 
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Very well, m'sieu.
You say I am a crook.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
They're all right, aren't they?
But, Lily--
Yes...?
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
I'll be delighted.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Beautiful.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Yes, I would!
And you're going to fall for them.
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Lovely.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
I beg your pardon!
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
There's a satellite call for you.
I make my own luck.
An accident?!
But I was with him the whole time.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Is this in any way unclear?
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
How you two doin'?
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
So don't marry him.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
And...?
A whole ten cents?!
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
May I cut in, miss?
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Is your stateroom alright?
Don't come any closer.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Oh--a hundred times--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
You'll excuse me. 
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Nice lines--
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
There's soft music--
This is Mr.--er--
When?
I could see you were pining away--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Not here--follow me around the shed.
You don't think--?
This is a business trip!
Shortie!--you know my motto?
It's your deal.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Well, he has a straw hat--
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Yes, Yes!
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
Nothin'.
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
I want them spitting blood!
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
On three?  You call it.
Very cosmopolitan.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
A which?
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
You're a little touchy about it.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
And I don't even know your full name.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Really?  You sure?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
Get down, boy.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
We should get moving.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Briefly.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
It must do something.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
That's reassuring.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Can you arrange a meeting?
I got you covered.
Bourbon. Neat.
Have we met?
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
Why don't we just take these -
He's killed closer.
Sleep well?
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
... And what do you call these?
What is HE doing here?
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
What is that?
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
It's good to be able to hear that.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
That smells like fresh coffee.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
What must I do?
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
How are you?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
To infinity and beyond!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Hey!  Wow!
We're almost there.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Yes, I can.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
THAT is Sid!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
What happened to you?
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Great!
Ha-ha!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Something's screwy here.
What?
No she's NOT --
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Laser-envy.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
I got it, Woody!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
There.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can't hold on much longer!
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Why does he need money?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Helena --
Don't bother.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Oh, it is?
Is this bad for him?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
In school?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
We aren't barbarians.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You first.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I got money.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
For fuck's sake.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Where are you going, Diane?
Great.
Holding hands?
Can I see you again?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Do you recall the school motto?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Clear?
Now remember --
But try too hard --
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
The park?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
Say something, Mark, say something --
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
You know.
God, you're sick.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
So?
What was your price?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
The Sick Boy method.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
This had better be good.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
How's it going with Gail?
A walk.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
What is it you seek?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
And that is?
Ah, Captain?
Oh, God
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
Spock.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
How do you know?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Spock... the booster rockets.
...mark two.
We must change our course at once.
I trust your message was received?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Each man's pain is unique.
Why not?
Are you embezzling?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Flynn!
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
You're alive!
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Did we make it?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
A User?
How?
My quarters.
You bitch.
Can you cover me for an hour?
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
You seem fine now.
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Guy's a spook!
She's lying.
Now what?
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
My husband is a good man.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
They said you had to run out.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Would you say he was boring, then?
And you agreed?
What?
Yes.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
What did he give you?
No.  But I wanted to.
As much as you used to?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Beat it.
Tell me what happened?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Who is this woman?
I didn't get any chicken.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
What are your turn-ons?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
So he really loved her?
Who?
What did he do to Arlene?
Yes.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Wannabee nigger...
Clarence sent a letter?
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
Is he big league?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
In case of what?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
No. But thanks.
Leave the gorillas.
What do you think, eightball?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Why does he trust you?
I'm really not very -
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
Come again?
Where'd he come from?
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
What was I sayin'?
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
No.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
A jail?  Prison?
What year do you think it is?
You used to call me "James".
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
See -- you can drive after all!
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
Germs?!
They hurt you!
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
JOSE!
Jo...Jose????
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
That a fact?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
How much time?
What time is it now?
Nothing.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What you want?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Who was that on the phone?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I got it.
That a fact?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
Take me with you.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
John!
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I guess I might as well get this done with.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Drop it, Jake.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Two-hundred dollars.
I asked you a question.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
What happened to your hand?
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Nooo!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Hey!
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
I came for Grace.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Got any requests?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You Harlin?
But he's dead.
So?
Twenty-after-ten.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Got any cold soda?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
My face tell you all that?
You love him?
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Yeah.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I can't see it.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
And I love you too.
What'd you say to me!
Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
Help me, Grace, help...
I want to stay.
Proceed.
Wrap it up.
Once again please?
I'm listening.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
You've never been sick?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
When?
I'm going to work out.
Don't be scared.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
Is this a religious thing?
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He's coming ain't he?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Hit your finger, huh?
I could run off them whores.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Maybe I ain't.
She's passed on, Kid.
Been gone near three years now.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Finish him, Ned.
Did you kill him?
Better re-load it.
He's in there.
I trust you, Bill.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
No.
Yeah?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
What is it, son?
Hullo, paw.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
His pistol must of jammed.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Well, suppose he does?
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I love you.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I'11 be alright.
How are they going to do it?
Three million?
We'll make it.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
No, no, no, no, no.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Then what?
What call?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
This is all bullshit.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
You're not safe on your own.
He was accused of jury tampering.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
What is the truth?
What are you doing here?
... he wants to testify ...?
Say it.
Thank you.  When Debby...
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Objection, we've...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
And you wrote that...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I need an extension for my case.
Listen to me, fella...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Mr. Galvin's...
Pardon?
Do you think it's my fault?
And it's over...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Uh ...
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...four years ago...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
What did she say?
Well, well, well.  Huh?
It's a long road that has no turning.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
How often does this happen?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
I want you.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Mmm.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
Where are you going?
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Love me... keep me safe...
You don't remember.
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
One shouldn't live alone.
Do you know where you're going?
How old?
Where are you now?
Why did you jump?
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Why?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
How do you know? Personal experience?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
I think I can lick it.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
The poor thing....
Out!
Midge!
What have you been doing?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Wait!
Stop it!
Her fucking head was caved in.
We can't do this.
So that's what we're doing.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
You got us into this mess.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Money?
That's right.
No I don't.
Your investment ideas never work out.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
What?
What's your point?
Okay fine.
Nope.
I don't hate women.
False.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Then what do they have?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Why?
He is.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
Not padded ones.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Hello.
What's the word on the chairs?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
No...No.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Fucking desert.
Are there many windows?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
Take me there.
You have no feelings toward ...
Yes, it is.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Is it all right?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
What's the matter with you?
She's mad.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Why are you crying?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
What?
Why would they be going there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
I should have told him.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
How should I know?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
Which way?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
...on the way in.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Mr. President, this is St...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
Yes
...they sound what?
Precisely.
...where is the Back End coming from?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
No rain.
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
...this is magnificent.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
What are we going to do?
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
Courage, Mom.
Stanley, you can't do this....
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Would you go to War to do that? 
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
How much...?
"The Country Is At War." 
They got to have something that we want.
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
...we get our hands on him?
What?
Mmm.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Mmm.
Wake up.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
I go with this here... 
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
It's tough to rhyme.
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...gimme some help...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
What's going on?
Hey the door was open.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
Speak English will ya.
You sure about this FAA announcement?
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Whatever night you like.
...thanks Natalie.
What if they call him?
I don't know anything!
What was that?
Yeah, right...
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
So what's the problem?
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
So what firm you with, pal?
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Hello Bud.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Where is it?
I don't.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
He still likes you
What's that?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
She went to a waxwork party
Tony and China?
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Well?
Do you have a scarf?
I miss you.
What?
Who's idea was it?
Fireball?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
I'm sorry?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Oh-kay...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
No, I don't.
I didn't sleep with him.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Well good.  So you're human.
Sit down here.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Jody he was lying.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
It's today?
If you have to work...
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Hi.
Did you call the police?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Get down!  He'll see.
It's a flare.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
What are you doing?
I don't need a shrink.
What are you...?  No.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Do I have everything?
You dropped a glass.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
Your wife...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
We have to get out of here.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Who is this...?
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
uh - then he - be just -
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
You're very clever, aren't you...?
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Yessss...
My jury's still out on that,
HARDER!
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Too much... too fast...?
Why don't you let at do that...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
You okay...?
OH MY GAWD!
Sounds good - thank you
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
This must be one of the old keys -
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
What did you do with her?
What didn't you like about her?
And how did it feel to be rid of him
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
Her husband left her
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
ANGEL...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
Well. The prom's coming up.
And I was wondering.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
I-I don't have the keys.
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy? I was thinking.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Can you believe that was me?
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I guess.
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I mean my father.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You think you're working with chimps here?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I'm warning you.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
What are you doing?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
How soon can we get something?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
About Suzie?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
You okay?
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
Then what?
I don't know what to say...
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Guess I kind of lost it there.
We all have...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Yes.
She bit you?
What did you do then?
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
Thank you, Jimmy.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
Say you love me.
No.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
That was about as grim as it gets.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
How...
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
J. S. Bach.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
But don't pull that again.
That's a lot of butler.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Now, what was that?
What was all that back there?
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
This is good.
What is that?
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He calls it the Tarantula.
A new friend?
You've... done... this... before.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Easy now.
Well?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
I can't.
I do what I'm told.
We're a tiny version of all that?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
Fresh goat's milk.
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
Because she's sick.
You?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
You must learn magic.
What'd you bit me for!!
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
Get back here, Rool!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Your hole is healed, then?
Everything is all right, John.
Hey, Sam...
What are you going to do?
Have you got your gun on now?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Who else knows?
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
It's all over, Paul.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Where are you taking us now?
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long?
How long have I been here?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
Sure.
That's God's way!
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Everything okay?
Good morning.
Is the English dead?
That has no place in this house.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
No, you listen. Get out!
He'll live.
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
No --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Yes.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
If she?
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Oh, now?
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Where do you want to be oiled first?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
We might.
Oh, my!
...has been simply unbearable.
Because I'm still scared!
Does it work?
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
...yes.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oil can what?
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Yeah.
What happened?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Stop pushing!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Where do we go now?
That's right.
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh, dear, dear.
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
Zukovsky...
Hes sealed himself in.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
He survived?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Shell get over it.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Does this look familiar to you?
Oh my God...were buried alive...
James...
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
I thought you were the one in her business.
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
Any word from him?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Hi, Jon.
I'm here, Laurie.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
. . . What?
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What was he doing?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
So do I.  So do you.
What caused it?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
I can fix it.
I'm terribly sorry.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
What do I get out of it?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
But programmable. And expendable.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Like what?
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
What are you?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
Are you alright?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Where are we going?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Where'd the damn truck go?!
The Peace conference...
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
What...?
Dude, what are you doing here?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
That was for Anders.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Are you all right?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
What is it you intend to do to me?
Who?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
You designed this yourself?
What did she do to me?
Is it enough?
Is that so?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
What was your grandfather's name?
Carlson!
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Darling!
Miss me?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Does that mean you love me?
I suppose you're right.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Dr. Frankenstein?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
What?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Are these your bags?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
You're sure you know what you're doing?
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
But you did -- I just heard it.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Get the sedative ready!
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Inga!
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Ooh!
It wasn't me.
Oh, Doctor!
I'd be so nervous.
What?
And Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, I have mine.
Yes, I know.
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
