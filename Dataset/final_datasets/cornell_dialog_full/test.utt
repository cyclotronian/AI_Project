sorry ,  clarence .  latest weather report shows everything socked in from salt lake to lincoln .

could i borrow your guitar ?  i thought i might be able to cheer her up . 
there &apos;s lots of things i haven &apos;t done ,  but his ain &apos;t high on the list .   don &apos;t take it personally . 
you are cassandra ? 
in there . 
so what &apos;ve you got on tuggle &apos;s killers ? 
you don &apos;t have squat . 
william harcourt ? 
he didn &apos;t recognize me . 
when we picked him up ,  he was talking to those two cops  -  -  the two who came to question you about hubley . 
look ,  you want to fit in here ,  right ?   you want to learn how to get along ? 
nothing ? 
i believe i should interview the widow alone . 
who said that ? 
screw you . 
your home is quite disordered .   i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in . 
your health .  .  . 
there is so much our two peoples don &apos;t understand about each other . 
she &apos;s going to divorce me . 
casull  . 454 magnum .   you &apos;re talking twice the impact energy of  . 44 magnum hot loads . 
mr .  hubley was an all right guy  -  -  and a damn good manager .   the men liked him .   i &apos;m really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes . 
you think this is the guy who did it ? 
you took this gut out ,  too ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
yeah ,  sykes ? 
watch the driver .   i &apos;m going for a better angle on the door . 
okay ,  let &apos;s do it . 
uh ,  .  .  . apone ,  i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc ,  over . 
i &apos;ve isolated a neuro - muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis .   it seems to be metabolizing .   he should wake up soon . 
but these things come from eggs .  .  . so where are all the eggs coming from . 
amy . 
it &apos;s all i could get .   anyway ,  it keeps my mind off of .  .  .  everything .   days off are worse . 
yes ,  and i &apos;ve read it .   you wake up every night ,  sheets soaking ,  the same nightmare over and over .  .  . 
yello ?   oh ,  ripley .   hi .  .  . 
well ,  i mean .  .  . i know this is an emotional moment ,  but let &apos;s not make snap judgments .   let &apos;s move cautiously .   first ,  this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it  -  - 
those specimens are worth millions to the bio - weapons division .   now ,  if you &apos;re smart we can both come out of this heroes .   set up for life . 
you &apos;ve been doing your homework .  look ,  they can &apos;t impound it if they don &apos;t know about it . 
these colonial marines are some tough hombres ,  and they &apos;re packing state - of - the - art firepower .  nothing they can &apos;t handle .  .  . right ,  lieutenant ? 
hold at forty .   slow circle of the complex . 
one of us ? 
at ease .   i &apos;m sorry we didn &apos;t have time to brief before we left gateway but .  .  . 
are there any questions ?   hudson ? 
save it . 
well you &apos;re not reading it right ! 
removed surgically before embryo implantation .   subject :   marachuk ,  john l .    died during procedure .   they killed him getting it off . 
it &apos;s game time . 
no !   no !   she &apos;s alive !   we have to  -  - 
this service tunnel is how they &apos;re moving back and forth . 
i don &apos;t care how !   think of a way .   think of something . 
well then somebody &apos;s just going to have to go out there .   take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually . 
they cut the power . 
range twenty meters . 
there &apos;s a guy on the horn ,  mom - and - pop survey team .   says he &apos;s homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored . 
casey .   she &apos;s my only friend . 
well ,  some kids can &apos;t handle it like you can . 
come on .   crawl faster . 
look ,  i can see where this is going .   but i &apos;m telling you those things exist .   back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs .   thousands .  do you understand ?   i suggest you find it ,  using the flight recorder &apos;s data .   find it and deal with it  -  -  before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise .  .  . 
why ? 
what did you think of the music ? 
oh  -  excuse me ! 
no ,  no ,  no ,  no .  you can &apos;t take him away now .  this is his night .  won &apos;t you introduce us ,  wolfgang ? 
i &apos;m not surprised .  money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship .  he has sold himself to vienna .  let vienna look out for him . 
if his grace is not satisfied with me ,  he can dismiss me . 
no ,  your grace !  i mean with all humility ,  no .  i would rather you dismissed me .  it &apos;s obvious i don &apos;t satisfy . 
don giovannnnnnnni ! 
well ,  i &apos;m not borrowing any more money from my mother ,  and that &apos;s that ! 
yes ! 
all they want to see is your work .  what &apos;s wrong with that ? 
my stanzi  -  look at her !  isn &apos;t she beautiful ?  come on now ,  confess ,  papa .  could you want a prettier girl for a daughter ? 
we &apos;ll have a little party .  come in .  come in .  you know herr schikaneder ?   this is !  a very nice girl . 
half the receipts !  stanzi ! 
you &apos;re not going to do this ? 
when ?  we need money now .  either he pays now ,  or you don &apos;t do it . 
what &apos;s that ?  oh !   who gave you this ?  how much is it ?  wolfi ,  who gave you this ? 
why you ? 
well ,  thank you very much .  you can go now . 
i regret we have no servants to show you out ,  herr salieri .  respect my wish and go . 
where &apos;s our friend ? 
oh yes ?  and what &apos;s so intelligent about writing a requiem ? 
i see that you &apos;re expecting . 
i am sorry ,  madame ,  but no !  i cannot let anyone pass . 
may i try it ? 
majesty ,  i don &apos;t like to talk against a fellow musician . 
do you like this ,  salieri ? 
bravo ,  mozart .  most charming .  yes ,  indeed .  clever man . 
may i introduce my father ?  he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg .  he would so much like to kiss your hand .  it would make his whole stay so memorable for him . 
mozart ,  i am a tolerant man .  i do not censor things lightly .  when i do ,  i have good reason .  figaro is a bad play .  it stirs up hatred between the classes .  in france it has caused nothing but bitterness .  my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people .  i do not wish to see the same fears starting here . 
forgive me ,  majesty .  i &apos;m a vulgar man .  but i assure you ,  my music is not . 
ah - ha .  well then ,  we should make some effort to acquire him .  we could use a good german composer in vienna ,  surely ? 
yes ,  sir . 
yes ,  what about him ? 
i write to you with urgent news .  i am coming to vienna .  take no further steps toward marriage until we meet .  you are too gullible to see your own danger .  as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours ,  do as i bid ,  and await my coming . 
ah !  here she comes .  fraulein lorl ,  good morning . 
not that i &apos;ve seen . 
oh ,  i wouldn &apos;t know that ,  sir . 
where does he work ? 
opera ?  opera ! 
well ? 
put it down ! 
it &apos;s a miracle ,  herr mozart ! 
what for ? 
well ,  this is hardly the way to go about it . 
how could i not ? 
no ,  no ,  no :  he has yet to achieve mediocrity . 
look ,  i must have pupils .  without pupils i can &apos;t manage . 
two thousand ,  two hundred florins is all i need a hundred ?  fifty ? 
wolfgang ,  what is it ?  sta calmo ,  per favore .  what &apos;s the matter ? 
why bother with orsini - rosenberg ?  he &apos;s obviously no friend of yours . 
a mass for the dead . 
how long will you give me ? 
where is your wife ? 
oh no .  it is a sublime piece .  the grandest operone .  i tell you ,  you are the greatest composer known to me . 
i do . 
would you ?  actually ,  you could . 
you know ,  it &apos;s all here in my head .  it &apos;s just ready to be set down .  but when i &apos;m dizzy like this my eyes won &apos;t focus .  i can &apos;t write . 
so now the confutatis .  confutatis maledictis .  when the wicked are confounded .  flammis acribus addictis .  how would you translate that ? 
confutatis maledictis . 
yes . 
we &apos;ll stop for just a moment .  then we &apos;ll do the lacrimosa . 
oh ?  have i seen it ? 
mozart !  herr mozart ,  may i have a word with you please .  right away . 
can we see the scene with the music back ,  please ? 
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee ?  just to teach a sixteen - year - old girl . 
i don &apos;t think it was really decided ,  director . 
about what ? 
do you hear me ? 
it was incomprehensible .  what was god up to ?  here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god &apos;s gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions  -  even though engaged to be married !   -  and no rebuke at all !  was it possible i was being tested ?  was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense ,  no matter how painful ?  that was very possible .  all the same ,  why him ?  why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility ?  my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man .  for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts .  i couldn &apos;t stop them . 
ballet ?  what ballet ? 
i know we banned this play ,  but frankly i can &apos;t remember why .  can you refresh my memory ,  herr director ? 
excuse me ,  sir ,  there is a lady who insists on talking to you . 
can we come in ? 
i &apos;ll call tomorrow . 
go about your duties . 
oh dear girl ,  your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me .  i don &apos;t give a damn who you sleep with .  i &apos;m concerned about david . 
well ,  yes ,  but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend . 
david says jack comes to warn him . 
dr .  hirsch ? 
right .  now listen carefully .  i want you to bring david here .  i want him in my care .  i &apos;ll notify the police that we &apos;ve found him .  it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital .  do you understand ? 
well ,  you &apos;re to take these after you &apos;ve eaten .  now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ? 
aw come on ,  miss price ! 
call me david . 
now ,  david ,  i said i would keep you company ,  but i meant right here and now . 
i &apos;m a werewolf . 
the kitchen . 
it &apos;s nice to see you . 
alex ? 
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ? 
i &apos;m off .  there &apos;s food in the fridge . 
hello ,  benjamin . 
well ,  all right then ,  be that way .  here ,  swallow this . 
i looked . 
now see here young man . 
that &apos;s easy for you to say  -  you &apos;re already dead . 
you be quiet ,  woman ,  and let me speak . 
no one brought them here !  no one wanted them here ! 
it &apos;s nearly eight .  i &apos;m off duty shortly ,  then i &apos;m off to the films with alex . 
an american film about the mafia called  &apos;see you next wednesday &apos; ,  and i want to see it badly ,  so you give me no problems and go to sleep . 
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences . 
how could there have been witnesses ?  it was so dark .  we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere .  .  .  i don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re talking about . 
jack . 
you &apos;re not having a good time are you ? 
you &apos;re talking about the woman i love . 
i have to make love to her .  it &apos;s very simple .  she has no choice really . 
the slaughtered lamb ? 
that &apos;s a wolf &apos;s head . 
jack ,  we &apos;d better go . 
come on ,  jack ,  shall we go ?  !  ! 
the hound of the baskervilles . 
heathcliffe . 
it &apos;s moving . 
i &apos;m going completely crazy . 
shut up ,  you zombie ! 
david ,  please believe me .  you will kill people ,  david .  you &apos;ve got to stop the bloodshed before it begins . 
get out of here ,  jack ! 
i didn &apos;t mean it .  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying .  i &apos;m not even sure it was me who killed those people .  i don &apos;t remember doing it . 
i could hang myself . 
do you have any hot soup ? 
remember the alamo ? 
he may have a point ,  lieutenant .  two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man . 
what do you suppose anybody wants ?  money ,  money ,  money ! 
oscar ,  what &apos;s the matter ? 
say matt ,  i &apos;ll have to have some money for those manville payrolls . 
when he comes in ,  tell him we &apos;re waiting for him in the board room . 
don &apos;t make me laugh ,  schultz ! 
what &apos;s the matter with my policy ?  how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty - five years ?   i &apos;ll tell you .  not a single one !   what &apos;s wrong with that kind of banking ? 
character ,  hmmpf !  that &apos;s your idea ? 
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you .  you thought they were your friends .  why don &apos;t you go out there now and try and get some help from them ? 
say ,  you can &apos;t do that
dickson ,  i &apos;d like to talk to you about the bank . 
looks like you &apos;re going to have no trouble at all .  what was the lady &apos;s name ,  mr .  cluett ? 
what were you doing at finlay &apos;s this morning ? 
confessed !  cluett ,  in heaven &apos;s name ,  what got into you ? 
fifty thousand dollars ! 
for a celebrated bounder ,  that is an awful admission .  besides ,  i never knew that any female could do this to you  . 
here ,  here ,  here ,  now !  don &apos;t you go back to work on me ,  too .  i &apos;m getting tired of this .  besides ,  it &apos;s beginning to affect your looks
running around .  not your work .   you &apos;d better start reforming ,  cyril ! 
come on cyril ,  try a little bit of it out on me .  i haven &apos;t had any first - class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married . 
you ?  no can do .  it &apos;s all set .  just a few of tom &apos;s closest friends . 
why are you so anxious ? 
no . 
what &apos;s this ? 
well ,  look who &apos;s here !  hello ,  dear . 
if this isn &apos;t a red - letter day for tom dickson !  first i trample on the board of directors ,  then i promote matt here to assistant cashier ,  and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife .  what a man ,  what a man ! 
oh ,  i did have a date with you tonight ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
ho !  ho !  ho ! 
listen ,  don &apos;t go around being attractive to anyone but me  .   .   . 
why ,  the directors are waiting for you in the board room . 
come on in here ,  helen .  bring your book .  i want some numbers to try to get some action .  get parker at the union - leeds  -  the exchange  .   .   .  winslow and old man harris at the home mortgage .  snap into it ,  helen .  just as quick as you can . 
what &apos;s the matter ?  you don &apos;t seem very excited about it . 
well ,  i
we haven &apos;t got much time left ,  mr .  dickson .  we &apos;ve got to do something quick or it &apos;ll be too late . 
well  .   .   .  uh  .   .   .  i  .   .   . 
i want you both to take the day off .  go downtown and get a license and get married right away ! 
why pick on him  ? 
that &apos;s what he says .  i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now . 
all i know is the bank &apos;s been robbed and a murder &apos;s been committed .  the way i see it ,  brown here looks guilty . 
look at them ,  mr .  dickson .  they &apos;re going crazy . 
absolutely . 
why ? 
the ten dollars . 
say ,  i just heard the merger isn &apos;t going thru .  isn &apos;t that grand ? 
what &apos;s the matter ,  matt ?  gee ,  i thought you &apos;d be thrilled to death . 
well  .   .   .   ? 
did you talk to him ? 
what did you find out ,  mike ? 
where &apos;s charlie ? 
i think i may just go on to the reservation . 
gatling !  they &apos;ve got a gatling ! 
i ain &apos;t done  -  - 
jesus mercy ,  that &apos;s charlie higgins ,  dave laller  .  .  . 
cole ,  i want to get to the farm ,  make sure little jim and the girls are okay . 
 &quot; the outlaws calling themselves the james - younger gang shot their way out of town ,  wounding the sherriff and three other townsfolk .  &quot; 
where you boys going ? 
home ,  boys .  back to our farms . 
i got seven thousand . 
jesse ,  we got to have a word . 
still smells fishy . 
bob ,  rip up some bandages . 
wait &apos;ll we get back to missouri ,  start telling those gals about how little jesse james charged the whole union army by himself ! 
tom ,  why don &apos;t you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation ?  figure we might have some work for you ,  if you want . 
cannon or gatling ? 
what ? 
daddy ,  don &apos;t start with this again . 
he thinks this is some kind of game ! 
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling ,  they try to shoot it off . 
and we &apos;re good at it . 
you &apos;ve killed your fair share of men . 
we &apos;re drunk . 
you taking sides against me ,  now ,  frank ? 
easterners . 
doc mimms will  -  - 
jesse ,  are you awake ? 
jesse ,  is that your hand ? 
teasing you is completely unfair . 
so you &apos;re saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ? 
i am so sorry ,  jesse . 
you and i ,  we &apos;ve started .  .  .  something ,  you know ?   i don &apos;t know what &apos;ll happen if you do this . 
hmm . 
now ,  sweetie ,  y &apos;all wouldn &apos;t go believing one of them silly dime novels ,  would you ? 
you get arrested again ,  i &apos;ll kill you . 
yes ? 
that &apos;s what i would have done . 
you cocky little bastard . 
i &apos;d just as soon kill you ,  jesse james .  but chasing you takes up too much of my time . 
not too young to shoot a man ,  not to young to drink . 
hell yeah !  i been with .  .  .   uh ,  not exactly .  it &apos;s just ,  i don &apos;t want to get one of these paid ladies ,  you know ? 
why ,  yeah . 
thank you ,  miss  -  -   ? 
relax ,  alan .  the army has this all in hand .  and mr .  thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news .  nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate . 
thirty - five thousand ,  sir .  coins and currency .  and the delay from the miles of destroyed track  -  - 
your men knew the risks . 
the final route for the railroad is complete . 
parker . 
what is that ? 
no need .  i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank . 
a facial at elizabeth arden ,  which was really relaxing ,  then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish .  
what are you doing tonight ? 
i haven &apos;t seen you around here . 
you have a really nice place here .  .  . paul .  how much did you pay for it ? 
nothing like last time ,  promise . 
so ,  you &apos;re looking great ,  how have you been ? 
are you using minoxidil ? 
where are you going ? 
girls dig bateman .  he &apos;s cq .  you &apos;re total cq ,  bateman . 
i think you should go now . 
it was a pretty long message ,  wasn &apos;t it ? 
carnes ?  wait . 
patrick ,  thanks so much for looking after courtney .  dorsia ,  how impressive !  how on earth did you get a reservation there ? 
that &apos;s a wonderful jacket .  let me guess ,  valentino couture ? 
it looks so soft . 
it &apos;s definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we &apos;ll be okay . 
marcus halberstam .  for two at eight ? 
dorsia ,  yes ? 
we are totally booked . 
okay ,  jean .  i need reservations for three at camols at twelve - thirty ,  and if not there ,  try crayons .  all right ? 
that is .  .  . if you &apos;re not doing anything . 
anywhere you want ? 
oh patrick ,  i can &apos;t make this decision . 
you don &apos;t need to lose any weight .  you &apos;re kidding ,  right ?  you look great .  very fit . 
well ,  maybe we shouldn &apos;t go out to dinner .  i don &apos;t want to ruin your willpower . 
do you have a boyfriend ? 
yes .  i don t think i can .  .  . control myself . 
patrick ?  is that you ? 
just .  .  . say .  .  . no ! 
a model ?  an actor ? 
welt .  .  . it depends ,  why ? 
well ,  i mean ,  um ,  it s really .  .  . bosco .  you know ,  like .  .  .  like a dove bar .  it &apos;s a dove bar .  .  . hershey &apos;s syrup ? 
what do you mean ,  she was a hot number . 
she &apos;s my .  .  . cousin . 
who ? 
come on .  i think it would be a turn - on . 
you &apos;re not with the fbi or anything ,  are you ? 
ah ,  i see .  .  . yes .  paul &apos;s disappearance .  .  . yes . 
understandable .   lime ? 
how well did you know him ? 
so .  .  . there &apos;s nothing you can tell me about paul owen ? 
actually ,  yes . 
that &apos;s so typical ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
how &apos;s the investigation going ?  taken anyone in for  &quot; formal questioning ?  &quot;  
i mean they want to get caught . 
what ? 
according to his date book ,  and this was verified by his secretary ,  he had dinner with .  .  . marcus halberstam . 
yes . 
oh .  kimball now where were you ?  
he wasn &apos;t with paul owen . 
i &apos;m so hungry . 
i lost my job .  .  . 
you &apos;re not what ?  qualified for anything else ? 
and cecelia ,  how is she ?  where is she tonight ? 
evelyn .  great ass .  goes out with that loser patrick bateman .  what a dork . 
i just don &apos;t see how someone ,  anyone ,  can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit .  how can you be so fucking ,  i don &apos;t know ,  cool about it ? 
a lot of what larry says is true .  they just clone stuff ,  or reverse engineer it ,  and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they  -  - 
if my dad &apos;d leveled with me like that even once .  .  .  the weird thing is ,  my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary ?  it &apos;s his fantasy ,  too . 
 .  .  . but ? 
that took some fun out of  -  - 
you think i don &apos;t know that ? 
how should i know ?   &quot; solving a problem ,  &quot;  i guess .  or needing to control everything .  i don &apos;t know .   i &apos;ve gotta get in there . 
it &apos;s almost nine ,  i &apos;ve been so worried !   what did you see in there ? 
no .  no .  i sent an e - mail to somebody ,  just now .  to tell her how i feel about you .   you know i &apos;m clueless ,  without you .  you know i  -  - 
lisa &apos;s an extremely valuable member of the skywire team .  we &apos;ve got our eyes on her .  you keep yours on milo . 
let me look into it ,  see what &apos;s being done .  frankly ,  it &apos;s not my area . 
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software .  you &apos;d be my partner . 
what ? 
 &apos;couldn &apos;t convince teddy to come ? 
 &apos;think i should buy some originals ? 
could work with a new switch .  there may be a few more things hidden . 
you really wrote this just today ? 
everything i do is under scrutiny .  the questions they ask ,  trying to make anything strategic look sordid .   i &apos;m confused .  doesn &apos;t everybody in business try to get ahead ? 
i heard what happened . 
i meant did you find other stuff to  -  - 
i &apos;m okay .  it &apos;s going well ! 
why did you move around so much ?  when you were a kid . 
 &quot; dear lisa .  i &apos;ve enjoyed working with you .  i &apos;d be lying if i didn &apos;t say i find you attractive .  but in my heart i know that alice .  .  .  &quot;   you left my party to send e - mail ? 
okay ,  #2 . 
gary ? 
it &apos;s only meaningful when you &apos;ve got 40 , 000 lines of code to back it up . 
what &apos;re we looking for ? 
that &apos;s great .  i  -  -  didn &apos;t know . 
i always felt if a  -  -  boy i liked ever found out  -  -  he &apos;d run .  he &apos;d think i was unclean . 
who can we trust ? 
the mainstream media .  tv ,  or a newsmagazine . 
time ? 
i don &apos;t know  -  - 
thank god . 
maybe it &apos;s the satellite . 
did you tell alice ? 
i dunno .  i guess larry &apos;s got me totally suspicious of that place . 
milo ,  geeks don &apos;t have two girlfriends .  most don &apos;t have one . 
what &apos;re they building ? 
maybe he &apos;ll get back to work . 
come in . 
may i wash you ? 
austin powers ?  hi ,  i &apos;m andy warhol . 
hungry .

hello austin .  hello vanessa .  this is basil exposition ,  from british intelligence .   there &apos;s a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr .  evil .  many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotel / casino where you &apos;ll be staying .  that &apos;s the first place you should look .   well ,  i &apos;m off to the chat rooms . 
my god ,  austin ,  what have you done ?

hey austin powers ,  it &apos;s me ,  mick jagger .

unfortunately ,  while you told that stupid story ,  dr .  evil has escaped . 
fancy a nibble ? 
watch out ,  you &apos;re on my hair ! 
austin ,  may i have a word with you ? 
since i &apos;ve been unfrozen ,  i &apos;ve had a rancid taste in my mouth .  do you have a piece of gum ?

breathtaking ,  frau .  these automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate powers . 
what is it now ? 
right . 
really ?  are they ill - tempered ? 
no ,  the boy &apos;s right .  i really am evil . 
the details of my life are quite inconsequential . 
no ,  we &apos;ll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying ,  and we &apos;ll just assume it all went to plan . 
come ,  everyone ,  let us repair to the main chamber .  project vulcan is about to begin .  scott ,  are you coming ? 
um ,  dr .  evil ,  prince charles did have an affair .  he admitted it ,  and they are now divorced ,  actually .

may i help you ,  madam  .  .  . 
congratulations ,  mrs .  peel .  you have been a worthy opponent .  you have tracked us down .  you are within an ace of winning . 
my number two .  special assignments .  she &apos;s  -  - 
welcome to mobile h . q .  weather &apos;s turning quite nasty .  sir august was blown to smithereens .  along with half of banffshire .   the ministry &apos;s worried . 
peter peel was a first class agent .  a senior operative .   &apos;x &apos; department special operations .  he was engaged in top secret research .  top priority .   government approved . 
this is an official matter ,  mrs .  peel .  no need to take it personally .  where are you going ? 
the doors and walls are monitored ,  mrs .  peel .  this is a very secure establishment . 
an unholy trinity  .  .  . 
spoil the majority shareholders .  in wonderland weather .  i planned everything ,  even the ministry recruiting you  .  .  . 
you disappoint me ,  emma .   can &apos;t you guess ?   for you .  it was all for you  .  .  . 
that &apos;s better .  i say ,  isn &apos;t this where you came in ?  it &apos;s impenetrable ,  by the way  .  .  . 
the result would be  .  .  . 
the missing piece of the jigsaw .  i tried to get you to give it to me as peter; i tried to steal it from you as dr .  darling .  as myself i &apos;ll be a bit less subtle .   with this ring my plan will be complete . 
choices ? 
dyed in the wool .  but i can admire someone who doesn &apos;t play by the rules . 
and i suppose you &apos;re the knight . 
no thanks . 
according to mother ,  sir august owns half of the highlands .  a millionaire .  former head of special projects at the ministry .  now  .  .  . 
not so much eccentric .  more barking mad .  he has a wife called june .  and a daughter somewhere  -  -  julie . 
for you ,  mrs .  peel . 
not quite .  this is my field . 
exactly .  there &apos;d been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea .  propane gas mostly .  in small quantities it captures chlorine .  protects the ozone layer .  but it proved impractical .  too bulky  .  .  . 
that &apos;s what we were working on . 
not that i know of .   explanation ? 
steed  .  .  .   ! 
we must hurry ,  mrs .  peel  .  .  . 
oh ,  and by the way ,  i think it &apos;s about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder . 
mrs .  peel ? 
our chaperon . 
oh ,  hello  .  .  . 
mother betrayed me .  she was going to replace me with a younger father .   errand boy that &apos;s all i was .   &apos;find steed .  .  .  &apos;
mother .  i thought you were burglars . 
think she really killed those agents ? 
why ? 
i &apos;m going to follow up on a hunch of my own .  if i &apos;m right ,  mrs .  peel is innocent and you have a mole . 
in your operation . 
what &apos;s happening ? 
he still thinks i &apos;m going with him .  i &apos;m going to break the news to him tomorrow . 
deb ,  we &apos;re pretending to be hookers . 
hey ,  you guys ,  what &apos;s going on ? 
and .  .  . 
he and debbie stand outside the theater ,  which is a multi - plex cinema .  fourteen movie theaters under one roof .  prominent is a sign which reads :   &quot; 24 hour 3d festival !  &quot;  cole drags debbie into one of the theaters .  the gang runs up to the theaters . 
so ,  cole ,  you been practicing your game ? 
nice shot . 
of course .  i &apos;m a traditional guy .  .  .  it &apos;s a traditional event .   well ,  what do you think ? 
well .  .  .  twenty - four more hours to go and tonight we &apos;ll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness . 
don &apos;t turn on the lights ,  sugar .   i &apos;ll lead you around . 
i don &apos;t believe you . 
see ?  and these are not just ordinary party - goers  -  -  there are professionals in this crowd  -  -  i didn &apos;t want any of them .  you .  .  .  you &apos;re what i want .  understand ? 
thanks for helping us out ,  ed .  we appreciate it . 
i &apos;ve had it ,  numb nuts .  .  .  how much money you got ? 
sounds swell .  .  .  i &apos;m really touched .  and my getting married &apos;s not gonna change a thing between me and my pals .  we &apos;re still gonna go bowling on tuesdays ,  play cards on fridays and wear women &apos;s clothes on sunday night .  i love you guys .  .  .  i always will . 
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you . 
what can i be doing for you ? 
so ,  larry ,  how have you been ? 
i hate her .  i hate her guts ,  the bitch . 
my marriage is the worst .  all crap .  a big pile of shit . 
she hates me .  it &apos;s over .  you &apos;ll see ,  as soon as you get married ,  everything changes .  you sure you want to go through with it ,  man ? 
the end . 
ebbie .  ger .  .  .  umph .  .  .  lable .  .  . 
where &apos;d she go ? 
we &apos;ll spend an hour with  &quot; nymphos without pants &quot;  .  .  . 
how  &apos;bout this ? 
what are you going to do about it ? 
you always were sneaky ,  stan ,  very sneaky . 
that &apos;s an even trade .  .  .  a cotton ball for all my blood . 
there can be no excuse for tardiness . 
sister ,  do you ever get lonely after vespers ?  if you do ,  why don &apos;t you give me a call .  i &apos;m in the book . 
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside ? 
can you believe how perfect it fits ? 
oh these moments do try me .  .  . 
aw man ,  stephen ,  listen to me .  .  . 
 -  -  knock it off ! 
 -  -  he killed people  -  -

i like what you &apos;ve done with the place . 
sheep don &apos;t count . 
ya love it ,  probie ? 
y &apos;know ,  you got an awful short memory for direct orders .  i told you to stay beside me . 
what ,  is it the stairs ?  christ ,  i &apos;ll let you win next time . 
it &apos;s okay ,  stephen ,  i  -  - 
oh god ,  stephen ,  what &apos;s going on with you ? 
how do you know ? 
 -  -  what were they doing there ? 
you &apos;re his lt .  ,  stephen .  .  .   are you gonna handle it ?  are you stephen ? 
not quite .  just visiting .  i live in lincoln park now . 
hey . 
i don &apos;t know anything about it . 
what &apos;ll you do ? 
okay ,  here &apos;s the deal .  i &apos;ll tell you a story ,  you tell me one .  fair ? 
that &apos;s a probie answer .  you &apos;re smarter than that ,  brian . 
who the fuck is doing this ? 
oh jesus christ .  .  . 
if it was a joke ,  sir ,  you &apos;d be laughing . 
no ,  it isn &apos;t out of your hands or you wouldn &apos;t even have met me .  if i push you have to let me back in .  dead hero father rule .  sir . 
then go find a corner .  i don &apos;t want you in my way . 
uh ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s in my contract .  .  . 
even if it was used to seal the air off ,  that doesn &apos;t explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft .  a gun &apos;s a helluva lot easier
i got it after we talked to ronald .  torches .  want to fry the whole goddamn world .  but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much .   -  -  the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls .  and he made his burns backdrafts .  
this is the copy of swayzak &apos;s manning report that was released .  everybody on this job knows it &apos;s bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers .  they &apos;re all airtight . 
well brian ,  i guess you can say it &apos;s arson now .  .  . 
did you pull me out ? 
another couple of good men get burned up for their city ?  is that how it &apos;s going to read ?   you &apos;re the only one that knows . 
yeah .  big fan . 
aren &apos;t you even curious ? 
how &apos;d you know ?  these are supposed to be sealed . 
man .  something sure put a crimp in his evening . 
really .  well ,  let &apos;s have a look at what else was  &quot; in your blood &quot;  .  i always look forward to getting these ,  they make such a nice collage for the bar .  .  .   &quot; assistant director ,  sales ,  aspen snowmobile tours .  .  .  &quot; 
dad ! 
yeah ?  when was the last time ? 
 -  -  he &apos;s gettin &apos; good on those eggs .  and y &apos;know ,  he told me he actually likes the piano . 
they ran the residue you scraped from both crispers &apos; front doors .  it &apos;s a combination of plumber &apos;s putty and rayophene gum .  burns almost completely away when you light it . 
shadow . 
 -  -  burn them . 
it knows us .  this one knows us . 
when are you going to catch the prick that &apos;s doing this ,  don ? 
people . 
i got it ,  man !  i will find those kids .  and i &apos;ll get the 50 g from the church !  then the kids &apos;ll go to jail .  i &apos;ll be in charge ,  of course .  after a little while ,  i &apos;ll break the fuckers out  -  -  and i &apos;ll turn them in to shithead i was just talking to .  and pick up his 100 g .  no .  i &apos;ll hit him up for 200 g .  or 250 g .  l can do it  -  -   &apos;cause i &apos;ve got the kids .  then ,  of course ,  there &apos;s the 180 g i &apos;m gonna pick up on the game tonight  -  -  when the strawberries win ! 
that stuff &apos;ll kill you quick ,  man . 
the rich kind .   jeez ,  man .  the way you smoke that shit is suicide . 
i forgive you . 
i forgive you . 
oh ,  really ? 
he &apos;s gonna kill you ,  man .  do you hear me ,  motherfucker ?  you .  dead .  get it ? 
he gots to be did . 
everybody say ho ! 
well you did . 
so now i see where you &apos;re coming from .   just because we ain &apos;t rapping about gucci ,  timberland ,  rolex ,  benz ,  cristal ,  ho &apos;s and bitches ,  we &apos;re pseudo . 
you don &apos;t have the demographics . 
that &apos;swhati &apos;msayin &apos; .   i &apos;m not blowin &apos; my young career ,  brother or no brother ,  for you or anybody else . 
the mau - mau &apos;s are up in dis place .  that &apos;s right ,  the mau - mau &apos;s . 
my righteous name is big black . 
please ,  have a seat . 
why they gotta make my nose so big ? 
i &apos;m not drinking the kool - aid . 
i &apos;m out . 
so that &apos;s what you been doing ? 
mantan ? 
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone ? 
the material you &apos;ve been creating is too white bread .   white people with black faces .   the huxtable &apos;s ,  cosby ,  revolutionary .   but that &apos;s dead .   we can &apos;t go down that road again . 
i &apos;ve done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right .   in my previous work it &apos;s been all surface ,  superficial .   i have never really dug deep .   not anymore .   as mark twain fully understood satire is the way .   race has always been a hot button in this country &apos;s history and it needs to be pushed harder .   if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony .  it &apos;s about promoting racial healing . 
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire . 
we gonna hit  &apos;em wid da bomb dickey on dis &apos; one .   what &apos;s the setting ? 
besides ,  what does he know about negroes ? 
in the immortal words of derrick coleman ,  whooopdeedamndoo !  !  ! 
hold on a sec ,  i got a call . 
pull up a chair .   oh ,  excuse me ,  this is my lady dot . 
dem white boys giving you a hard time ? 
so what &apos;s up with you ? 
nobody told me anything . 
good morning ,  for those of you who don &apos;t know me ,  i &apos;m pierre delacroix .  i &apos;m running things and this here is my assistant sloan hopkins . 
thanks . 
how long have you and hambone been hangin &apos; out ? 
dela ,  you should try it sometime .  come into the light . 
this is crazy . 
to answer your question ,  there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons ? 
of course i &apos;m happy for you .  you &apos;ve worked very hard for your success . 
you know how your daddy is . 
how did you get this gig ? 
myrna is here to help us plan our strategy . 
if that was suppose to be a compliment ,  i thank you . 
not for me ,  my woolly headed cotton pickin &apos; friend for .  .  . 
 .  .  . then what about .  .  . 
people show their happiness in a lot of different ways . 
a lot ? 
the good stuff . 
did you ever sleep with dela ? 
upon my word ,  sir ,  i think you have acted very coolly . 
sir ,  i &apos;m a british officer . 
what is the service ,  sir ? 
grogan gave me a wink of recognition ,  but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters ,  and then ,  shaking hands with me cordially ,  gave me news which i wanted ,  of my family . 
you &apos;re an impostor ,  young man ,  a schemer ,  a deceiver ! 
chevalier ,  if you will have your money now ,  you must fight for it .  if you will be patient ,  maybe i will pay you something another time . 
where is my rascal ,  lazlo ? 
all europe shall hear of this ! 
for whom else have you worked ? 
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost . 
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins ,  and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags ,  what did we ask ? 
then you yield to me . 
never . 
suppose ,  now ,  roderick ,  you ,  who are such a hero ,  was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side . 
all the same ,  you must name an amount . 
then this must be done tomorrow . 
there are a few other points we should discuss .   the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship &apos;s signature ,  and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship &apos;s freewill in giving her signature . 
but i will have it on my birthday ,  won &apos;t i ? 
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolan &apos;s farm to see him . 
don &apos;t like  &apos;em ,  don &apos;t eat  &apos;em ,  don &apos;t make no damn difference to me . 
can i at least have a drink ? 
bill styles .  .  . 
fuck ,  what the fuck is going on  -  - 
we got  -  -  i don &apos;t know ,  we got separated
what about you ,  wandering around alone ?  at least we have an alibi  -  - 
why not ? 
so childs made some side money ,  so what ?  people are dead ,  ray ,  and the only one we have to blame is you  -  - 
i apologize  -  - 
you saved kendall &apos;s life  -  - 
we &apos;re not finished yet  -  - 
not true ,  cadet ,  i &apos;ve got a gun  -  - 
i promised them i &apos;d ask you where west and the others are .  .  . 
that first night with pike .  i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300 . 
he said he worked there  -  - 
where ? 
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end .  you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him ,  too . 
jesus ,  what happened ? 
what do you mean ,  west &apos;s ? 
you hated west ,  mueller loved him  -  - 
combat grade morphine .  mueller sold it to me . 
why .  .  .  why didn &apos;t you tell me ? 
that still doesn &apos;t mean you didn &apos;t kill him . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .  .  . 
dunbar was running out the door ?  ohhhhhh .  .  .  see that &apos;s where i was confused ,  because i thought you said nunez was running out the door . 
this is warrant officer julia osborne ,  the closest thing we have to an in -  house investigator . 
no ,  the problem is one &apos;s dead ,  one &apos;s got a bullet in his arm ,  and one won &apos;t talk .  the one who won &apos;t talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick - up . 
pike killed west ,  dunbar killed mueller ,  childs ,  and nunez . 
without the body we have no physical proof .  we need a confession . 
you want a confession ?  why don &apos;t you confess ,  bill :  people are dead and you don &apos;t give a shit about it !  only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job ,  you know this is your fault  -  - 
toxicology report came back .  kendall &apos;s attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine ,  maybe you &apos;ve heard of it .  it &apos;s for asthmatics .  if an epileptic takes enough ,  it kills them .  i checked with the nurses at the hospital  -  -  you &apos;re the only other person who visited kendall . 
gotta be honest ,  i love what you &apos;ve done with the place  -  - 
you really want to make banal chit -  chat like that now ? 
something like that .  you ? 
you do understand that there &apos;s absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you ,  right ? 
something wrong ? 
that was kid gloves ? 
 &quot; too neat .  &quot;  how long have you been an investigator ? 
at least you and kendall agree on that . 
talk it through :  childs ,  mueller ,  and nunez know they &apos;re going out on the regular tuesday night drill ,  hurricane or no hurricane ,  so they plan it :  kill west ,  pin it on pike . 
dunbar . 
no bodies ,  no west .  .  . 
we need to talk  -  - 
west ? 
nah . 
we should tell him we &apos;re not going . 
running out of time ,  are we ?  tick -  tock ,  tick - tock ,  how long till your witnesses fly the coop ? 
it won &apos;t work  -  - 
dunbar &apos;s telling the truth . 
i told him what had really happened to west .  told him to keep quiet about it or i &apos;d destroy him .  because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam ,  my father would be finished . 
what the fuck happened to you  -  - 
this place is going ,  mueller .  we gotta move  -  - 
goddammit ,  ray ,  we gotta get out of here  -  - 
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard  -  - 
until we return to base ,  and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west &apos;s body  -  - 
this is totally unnecessary  -  - 
but this guy you called ,  he &apos;s not even army  -  - 
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit ,  and those who refuse to quit i will kill .  you ever hear of a training accident  -  -  give me a sir ,  yes ,  sir ! 
some of you may have heard there &apos;s a hurricane coming !  american soldiers do not wait for good weather  -  -  they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty !  an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy !  anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh ,  feel free to lay down and die ,  you get me ? 
tough break .  most men have to get married before they lose their wives . 
welcome to ya .  what &apos;s your name ? 
promise me you &apos;ll come back . 
you &apos;re beamen &apos;s daughter .  your last name is different .   you married .

and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die ,  she &apos;s the only one .

wouldn &apos;t lie to you .  and they &apos;ve got all - you - can - eat buffets .  you can eat a lot ,  can &apos;t you ? 
what did she say ? 
what ,  a father &apos;s not allowed to talk about his son ? 
you  -  -    -  -  are in for a surprise . 
people needn &apos;t worry so much .  it &apos;s not my time yet .  this isn &apos;t how i go . 
you owe me three - fifty .

logically ,  you couldn &apos;t be the witch ,  because she was old back when he was young . 
i &apos;m sorry .  it seems every hour i have to .  .  . 
what about the details ?  how they fell in love .  the circus .  the war .  you never told me any of that . 
mmm . 
how much time does he have left ? 
is he awake ? 
put it in the cases .  split it up .  and don &apos;t forget you owe me 150 . 
the sets were good . 
it &apos;s enough isn &apos;t it ? 
this is sensitive .  your car .  lovely car .  doesn &apos;t necessarily give the right impression . 
to customers approaching the bank from the rear

what ? 
fine . 
so uh .  .  . 
excuse me ? 
yeah .  i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too . 
we &apos;ll pretend it never happened . 
whereas  &quot; wet  &apos;n &apos; wild &quot;  is an emotional journey .   &quot; tied and tethered &quot;  .  it &apos;s pretty moving huh ?  like anna karenina . 
excuse me ? 
are you scared ?

every once in a while some cat comes to me .  he wants to know how i made it .  how did i become a success ?   the first thing i tell them is :  follow your instincts .  let your instincts guide you .  the second thing i tell them is ,  for christ &apos;s sake :  you got to know your grammar . 
tell me something .  what the hell kind of name is dignan ? 
well ,  he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped .  and he also agreed you were a liability .  but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses .

 .  .  . ivan mevedev  -  -  senior financial manager  -  -  worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies ,  pecos oil .  he claimed to know where the money landed .  we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency .  .  .  this .  .  .

a thousand .   you have made me guardian of scotland .  so i tell you this is what we face . 
with cavalry  -  -  not heavy ,  like the english ,  but light ,  fast horsemen ,  like you nobles employ  -  -  we could outmaneuver their bowmen ! 
if i pay homage to another &apos;s throne ,  then how am i a king ? 
what is it ?  ! 
so i did !  and what was so important about it ? 
now ,  my flower ,  do you understand ? 
we make spears .  a hundred spears .  fourteen feet long . 
thanks for the food and drink .  and for bringing  &apos;em yourselves . 
that &apos;s just a dream ,  william ! 
we must have alliance with england to prevail here .  you achieved that !  you saved your family ,  increased your lands !  in time you will have all the power in scotland !  .  .  .  yet you grieve . 
i sent for him  -  -  and the little coward send you ?  ! 
then why does he stay ?  my scouts say he has not advanced . 
i &apos;m not just saying it ! 
i don &apos;t want to scare you .  i want to be yours ,  and you mine .  every night like this one . 
i &apos;m dreaming . 
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes .  scotland is in chaos .  your husband is secretly sending an army north . 
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities ?  the executioner of the king &apos;s nephew ,  my husband &apos;s own cousin ? 
you have .  .  .  you have a husband . 
then tell me what a king is !  is he a man who believes only what others believe ?  is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart ?  there is strength in you .  i see it .  i know it . 
who would do such a thing ? 
anything . 
if i had to guess ,  i &apos;d say the blackouts are stress related . 
darn it ! 
no . 
that &apos;s why i wanted you to come here ,  evan .  dr .  redfield already has a background in memory loss . 
what happened ? 
it &apos;s a little complicated .  i haven &apos;t seen results exactly like these before . 
this is where we &apos;re finding most of the hemorrhaging .  the outer lining of the cerebral cortex . 
hey ,  evan .  what &apos;s the big rush ?  we don &apos;t meet for another hour . 
did your mom say if lenny was .  .  .  okay ? 
when we were kids .  your dad was making a movie .  robin hood or something ? 
what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect ?  like ,  looking back ,  whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away ? 
are you okay ? 
i don &apos;t know .  you seem .  .  .  different .  you make weird jokes .  your accents changed .  you don &apos;t even walk the same . 
ha !  where &apos;s that ? 
because you &apos;re .  .  .  different . 
on the bridge .  how did you know that tommy had your dog ?  that was no fucking hunch . 
you &apos;re right ,  evan ,  i don &apos;t believe you . 
i just thought you should know . 
you know how spiritual he &apos;s gotten ever since he saved mrs .  halpern and katie . 
i never knew that .  so then you still sometimes think of us .  .  .  together ? 
and .  .  .  ? 
where am i ?  what happened ?  where did we all go ? 
what time is it ? 
that &apos;s dangerous !  you could blow your hands off ! 
i was praying this curse would have ended with me . 
thanks .  wow .  hey ,  i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow .  if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers .  .  . 
smells like sex in here . 
you knew the whole time ,  didn &apos;t you ?   when you put the blade in my hand ,  you knew something big was going to happen .  didn &apos;t you ?  ! 
uh ,  we should be getting to class now . 
leave us alone you sick fuck ! 
what the hell are you doing ? 
meant no offense . 
you put the mommy too far away .  mrs .  boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it . 
no ,  i mean ,  is he trustworthy ?  is his word  -  - 
so you decided to go to america . 
you want my advice ? 
monsieur rick ,  i  -  - 
good . 
we read five times that you were killed in five different places . 
i see . 
oh ,  two weeks ,  maybe three . 
now you finish locking up ,  will you ,  carl ? 
goodnight . 
i &apos;d better be going . 
shall we draw up the papers ,  or is our handshake good enough ? 
of course they stay .  rick &apos;s wouldn &apos;t be rick &apos;s without them . 
there are only two other alternatives for him . 
a franc for your thoughts . 
i &apos;m willing to be overcharged .  tell me . 
why there is no other man in my life ? 
richard ,  they &apos;ll find out your record .  it won &apos;t be safe for you here . 
ten years ago ?  let &apos;s see .  .  .    .  .  . yes .  i was having a brace put on my teeth .  where were you ? 
yes ,  of course ,  we  -  - 
i didn &apos;t count the days . 
can i tell you a story ,  rick ? 
why not ?  after all ,  i got stuck with a railway ticket .  i think i &apos;m entitled to know . 
all the same ,  someday you &apos;ll lie to laszlo .  you &apos;ll be there . 
how did you get in ? 
your unexpected visit isn &apos;t connected by any chance with the letters of transit ?  it seems that as long as i have those letters i &apos;ll never be lonely . 
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is ?  what an important cause he &apos;s fighting for ? 
i don &apos;t understand .  what about you ? 
yes . 
play it once ,  sam ,  for old time &apos;s sake . 
no ,  ilsa ,  i won &apos;t let you stay here .  you must get to america .  and believe me ,  somehow i will get out and join you . 
our faithful friend is still there . 
yes . 
hello ,  rick . 
well then ,  perhaps you also  -  -  - 
i &apos;m afraid major strasser would insist . 
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca . 
isn &apos;t it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ? 
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs ? 
i &apos;ll raise it to two hundred thousand . 
i brought the money ,  monsieur blaine . 
monsieur laszlo ,  is it not ? 
that &apos;s strange .  nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca . 
monsieur ,  insofar as it is in my power  -  - 
this is hardly the time or the place . 
and that is ? 
thank you .  it is a pleasure to have you here ,  major . 
rick ,  this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich . 
mademoiselle . 
as to laszlo ,  we want him watched twenty - four hours a day . 
yes ,  much too good a time .  the place is to be closed . 
it was a combination of all three . 
it doesn &apos;t matter .  there is no exit visa for him . 
the winning side would have paid you much better . 
that makes rick a citizen of the world . 
oh ,  it &apos;s my party . 
why do you interfere with my little romances ? 
ricky ,  i &apos;m going to miss you .  apparently you &apos;re the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i . 
call off your watch - dogs you said . 
i suppose you know this isn &apos;t going to be pleasant for either of us ,  especially for you .  i &apos;ll have to arrest you of course . 
will i see you tonight ? 
you &apos;ll excuse me ,  gentlemen .  your business is politics .  mine is running a saloon . 
uh ,  excuse me ,  please .  hello ,  rick . 
huh .  you know ,  rick ,  watching you just now with the deutsches bank ,  one would think you &apos;d been doing this all your life . 
thank you .   will you have a drink with me please ? 
but why ?  oh ,  you object to the kind of business i do ,  huh ?  but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didn &apos;t help them .  that &apos;s not so bad .  through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas . 
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault &apos;s price .  i get it for them for half .  is that so parasitic ? 
one moment .  tonight i &apos;ll be selling those for more money than even i have ever dreamed of ,  and then ,  addio casablanca !  you know ,  rick ,  i have many friends in casablanca ,  but somehow ,  just because you despise me you &apos;re the only one i trust .  will you keep these for me ?  please . 
boss ,  ain &apos;t you going to bed ? 
they grab ugarte and she walks in .  well ,  that &apos;s the way it goes .  one in ,  one out .  sam ? 
get up . 
if they can &apos;t see you ,  what &apos;s the point ? 
polaris ,  where are you ?   maybe i &apos;m too far south . 
jesus . 
it &apos;s real . 
want to come in ?   get dry for a minute . 
oh ?   you &apos;ve tried ? 
i can &apos;t believe this .   i  -  -  i  -  -  they are .  .  .  you &apos;re a gifted artist .   you &apos;re into something very powerful .   primal .  truly . 
you ?   personally ? 
got to follow the paper path here . 
ah ,  the staff meeting could have gone better . 
get back ?   from where ? 
i got married . 
if i &apos;d known you were alive  -  - 
i didn &apos;t want to .   it just happened .   one day gary was there .   he took care of everything .   he took care of me .   i was a mess . 
her name &apos;s hannah . 
all that time i waited to go on a cruise ,  and you went without me . 
that about sums it up . 
the plane went down .   my friends died .   i washed up on an island .   then i found these barrels ,  built the raft ,  and here i am . 
come on .   try . 
so simple to say ,  so hard to do . 
sorry .  .  . sorry .  .  .  why do my joints still ache ? 
yes ,  yes he did . 
i used to drive one of those .   a long time ago . 
you &apos;re chuck noland . 
it seemed like she had such a good time last time . 
maybe i should take a few days off .  roger &apos;s working now ,  you could use some help around here .  .  . 
what a journey you &apos;ve had .   it seems more than a person should have to bear . 
kamal is not here . 
that &apos;s why you &apos;re a gambling man . 
for the third time . 
hello ? 
god damn !   god damn !   chuck ,  it &apos;s you ! 
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . 
what ,  then ? 
he &apos;ll need clothes .  .  .  some money .  .  . 
you *invented* him !  you &apos;ve completely made his up ! 
uh .  .  .  i &apos;d like to show them that i can cook ,  a little . 
shouldn &apos;t we tell homer ? 
oh .  .  . 
i &apos;m a little worried about the .  .  .    .  .  . about how much bleeding is okay . 
uh .  .  .  have you been *feeling* okay ? 
you have to come to my dad &apos;s lobster pound and see one ,  then . 
a movie *outside* ? 
what &apos;s the *medical* explanation ? 
i *know* this was right . 
do you think i &apos;m having a good time ?  do you think i &apos;m just *teasing* you ?  do you think i *know* whether i want you or wally ? 
she won &apos;t go to st .  cloud &apos;s ! 
i know .   is *that* nothing . 
please don &apos;t make me say it again . 
and now that wally &apos;s coming back ,  and because he &apos;ll certainly *need* you .  .  . 
this came for you a couple of days ago .  olive asked me to bring it .  with everything happening ,  i guess she forgot . 
he thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches . 
that &apos;s true . 
you mean they &apos;ll replace you with someone who won &apos;t perform abortions . 
i just wanted to ask you .  .  . 
*liver* killed him ? 
uh .  .  .  i &apos;m shipping out sooner than i thought .  i just wanted to be sure you were settled in -  - and happy enough ,  considering .  .  .   are you bored stiff ?  or can you stick it out for a bit ? 
that &apos;s better .  i can tell you got yourself some education .  them &apos;s good hands you got ,  homer .  them hands you got ,  they know what they &apos;re doin &apos; -  -  ain &apos;t that right ? 
are we supposed to be up here ?  the rules said .  .  . 
cider don &apos;t have no taste till later in october -  - it &apos;s too watery now ,  when we &apos;re usin &apos; just them early macs and them gravensteins .  you don &apos;t get no *good* cider till you &apos;re pickin &apos; them golden delicious and them winter bananas ,  them baldwins and them russerts .  .  . 
i think you been stayin &apos; up too late at night ,  homer . 
first pregnancy ? 
i don &apos;t think so . 
henceforth you shall be .  .  .  little wilbur . 
okay ,  he &apos;s just a wilbur then . 
it &apos;s just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people . 
don &apos;t mess in this ,  homer ,  if you know what &apos;s good for you . 
shit .  we don &apos;t know what he is . 
it &apos;s not that hard to find it in there ,  jack -  - it &apos;ll take you just a minute .  you just gotta go fishin &apos; . 
i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed -  - that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here . 
no autonomic effects .  .  .  that &apos;s correct . 
ain &apos;t you gonna see what it is ,  homer ? 
don &apos;t this place look like home ? 
i told him that you all is sick . 
she &apos;s *good* with that knife !  she &apos;s real fast .  she &apos;s a lot better with that knife than *you* is ,  muddy !  and who do you suppose taught her ? 
that sounds like you is in trouble already ,  homer . 
now ,  now ,  jack -  - that just ain &apos;t right . 
where do you think you &apos;re going ? 
but i &apos;m not that late .  you didn &apos;t have to give away my seat . 
grifters .  .  . 
keeping the fix happy . 
like what ? 
we were back on . 
alright .  .  .  turn around .  she doesn &apos;t get shit ,  unless i get that money .  where is it ? 
oh ,  jake .  you disappoint me .  and you just let lily here down again .  what was it you said about playing the big con ? 
we &apos;ll take care of it . 
what are you ?  new ?  let me tell you how good this guy is .  last night ,  al calls this bookie to settle up .  apparently he &apos;s been ducking him for like a month .  so the guy asks him where he &apos;s got all this money all of a sudden ,  right ?  what does al do ?  does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond ?  does he tell him he &apos;s been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop ?  no .  .  .  he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole - type .  .  .  how he fleeced . 
it can buy you a new and better you . 
grifter huh ?  where have you been on the grift ?  couldn &apos;t been here long  &apos;cause i would have heard of you ,  skippy . 
honest mistake .  just give me the money back and all will be forgiven . 
fucking grifters !  i love it !  you got balls ,  i &apos;ll give you that much . 
stake you ? 
excuse me ? 
that tip not work - out for you fellas ? 
of course .  jake .  nice to see you . 
i lost my head .  i &apos;m .  .  .  sorry .  i don &apos;t know what happened . 
what about .  .  .  the money ? 
what is this ?  you guys cops or something ? 
we have work .  it pays a lot .  unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up . 
mr .  king ,  i think  -  - 
i don &apos;t trust anyone . 
you just put a mother of a jinx on us . 
you told me to change my hair ! 
we were friends .  i trusted him .  i should have known it was weird .  but ,  then again i was weird . 
he was looking out for you . 
shit ,  what was that guy &apos;s name ?  i really liked him . 
you got my cell .  leave a message . 
it &apos;s bad luck . 
do we want insurance ?   i &apos;m just asking .  .  . 
why ? 
him . 
feeling lucky today ,  miles .  found a penny  -  -  heads up .  there was an empty cab right outside my building .  we hit every green light . 
i &apos;m sorry .  nothing under pearson . 
what &apos;d he say ? 
try and keep up .  .  .  you ask for the advantage goods ,  then you guys come in looking to be bean traps .  so i gotta think you &apos;re either working the mace or playing the jug mob . 
still time . 
if you feds are so hot for him ,  why don &apos;t we just bring him in right now ? 
did he buy it ? 
do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig ?  he sent me a birthday card .   belated ,  but it &apos;s the thought ,  right ?  oh ,  this prick &apos;s got a sense of humor .  but ,  then again you guys probably know him better than i do .  in fact ,  i &apos;ve only met the guy once .  but now ,  now i have you .  the next best thing .  his partners .  his  &quot; fix .  &quot; 
don &apos;t be an idiot .  how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer &apos;s drugs to another drug dealer ?  if vig &apos;s right ,  we might be looking at a hundred ,  maybe a hundred fifty grand .  .  . 
i &apos;m bella . 
i hate cheats . 
reynolds got a doctor in .  they forced me to take a dope test .  it was positive .  as you knew . 
is that your idea of arithmetic ? 
eight - fifty . 
how &apos;s that football story corning along ? 
you really are a beautiful woman . 
it came my way .  450 a week . 
are you trying to read my palm ? 
how did it go ? 
i loved it blond . 
where &apos;ve you been ?  i &apos;ve got to give evidence in court at nine . 
this fucking job &apos;s getting to you .  you haven &apos;t written a fucking word since you started . 
well ,  that &apos;s my poor upbringing .  i didn &apos;t go to no private school .  i haven &apos;t got no class .  i want to live with a writer .  not a fucking croupier .  i don &apos;t even know what the word means .  croupier . 
i don &apos;t give a fuck about the sex .  most men &apos;ll fuck a lamppost .  he &apos;s just a miserable zombie .  is that the way you feel now ?  is that what &apos;s happened to you ? 
i &apos;ll leave the casino soon .   i promise . 
what ? 
aren &apos;t you ever tempted to gamble ? 
what ? 
i &apos;ve lived there . 
how did you hurt your hand ? 
which side do you like ? 
just listen .  you don &apos;t have to do anything criminal . 
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after .  they want someone they can be sure of ,  an honest dealer .  that &apos;s the point .  not all dealers are honest .  mr reynolds will never suspect you . 
and your hand too . 
hello .  .  . 
you &apos;ve been avoiding me . 
where do you live ,  jack ? 
i &apos;ll lay you five to one you won &apos;t sleep .  in this job you have to unwind .  otherwise it &apos;ll kill you .  i mean that . 
i don &apos;t get you .  even if it was true ,  which it isn &apos;t ,  what the fuck difference would it make to you ? 
i can &apos;t give you a lift back tonight . 
rough day ? 
david reynolds ,  i &apos;m the manager here .  sit down ,  john . 
there are three types of casino in the u . k .  high volume .  small faction .  and motr .  that &apos;s middle of the road .  us . 
haven &apos;t you forgotten something ? 
ever ? 
girlfriend ? 
this is our crow &apos;s nest .  i &apos;m showing it to you now ,  but you &apos;ll never see it again . 
i can tell ,  the damn thing just doesn &apos;t understand . 
pinback ,  i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven . 
it &apos;s a goddamn wild goose chase .  remember when commander powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud ? 
right ,  that synchronizes here .  okay ,  bomb ,  arm yourself . 
the only thing which exists is myself . 
bomb ,  this is doolittle .  you are not to detonate ,  repeat ,  you are not to detonate in the bomb bay .  disarm yourself .  this is an order . 
hello ,  bomb ,  are you with me ? 
are you willing to entertain a few concepts ? 
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me . 
now ,  bomb ,  consider this next question ,  very carefully .  what is your one purpose in life ? 
well then ,  you &apos;ve already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe . 
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate . 
yes ,  of course you remember it ,  but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality . 
so if you detonate in .  .  . 
ah ,  what was that again ,  i still can &apos;t hear you ? 
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction . 
your ghf reading is minus fifteen . 
another unknown .  not on the charts .  a red dwarf . 
you know ,  talby ,  you really ought to eat with the rest of us .  you spend too much time up here . 
 .  .  . should spend some time below ,  see more of the rest of the ship .  .  . 
sorry to interrupt your lunch ,  sir ,  but i &apos;m in the computer room ,  and i think i &apos;ve located the malfunction .  the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser ,  down by the emergency air lock .  can &apos;t pinpoint it exactly ,  but i &apos;m going down there with a starsuit and try to find it . 
ah ,  well ,  i think i &apos;ve found the malfunction ,  sir .  i &apos;m in the emergency air lock .  .  . 
what happened ,  doolittle ? 
call the skank now or i start redecorating . 
but i &apos;m afraid of -  - 
nobody there to sign for it ,  mon .   what &apos;s a bruddah s &apos;posed to do ,  ride around all day with the damn package ? 
what &apos;re you lookin &apos; at me for ?   i &apos;m not his next of kin .   anyway ,  i don &apos;t got that kind of cash lyin &apos; around . 
no .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry ,  i &apos;m coming to get you . 
original cindy ,  say hi to my good friend -  - 
sorry about your window . 
how does mrs .  eyes only like being married to a guy on everybody &apos;s hit list ? 
personally ,  i &apos;m more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the trans american building with my pals .  instead of giving myself a headache over stuff i can &apos;t do anything about . 
how &apos;m i s &apos;posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo &apos;s probably touched everything i own ? 
l - triptophane .  .  . a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures .   then the lightbulb went off . 
yeah ,  i catch your hacks .   he &apos;s satan &apos;s lap dog ,  or something . 
what &apos;s this ? 
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe ,  sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation .   but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden .   wasn &apos;t s &apos;posed to ,  but it did .   and it &apos;s back to the law of the jungle .   you got your predators and you got your victims . 
i &apos;m looking for a lady who works here . 
but she does work here ? 
none . 
who is it ? 
help .  .  .  lemme go .  .  .  no ,  don &apos;t let me go .  .  .  help .  .  . 
who &apos;s this guy ?   this isn &apos;t who we &apos;re looking for .  .  . her name was hannah . 
then what ?   that &apos;s it .   that &apos;s all i got . 
she was a nurse .   she must &apos;ve lived near there ,  somewhere ,  near the .  .  .    .  .  . the clinic .   there must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for wyoming . 
whoever tossed this place wants you .   and i &apos;m looking to stay outta the line of fire . 
zero .  .  .  c &apos;mon ,  dan i don &apos;t have all day . 
just give it to me .   i &apos;ll remember . 
you &apos;re way more philosophical than i could ever be . 
a little what ? 
yeah ,  i can see to it your winning streak continues . 
and she bought that ? 
she &apos;s got my word . 
quitting time .   grab a cold one ? 
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way ? 
you rock ,  max .   you .  .  .  rock .  .  .

amanda ,  as ironic as this is gonna sound ,  i can &apos;t take any money for .  .  .  i &apos;m no midnight cowboy ,  y &apos;know .  it would only cheapen the whole deal for me . 
coming dad .   i &apos;ll call you .  soon as we get a phone .  bye . 
so ,  are you ,  like ,  gonna polish our nobs ,  or what ? 
there &apos;s only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn &apos;t matter anymore ,  lex .  you familiar with a condition known as absolute zero ? 
jeezis ,  hawk ,  can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit ? 
cool ,  bro ,  now listen up .  .  . 
i found the volvo . 
where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour ? 
don &apos;t worry about it .  they &apos;re perfectly safe .  we can pick them up after school .  my mom won &apos;t be home .  it &apos;s no problem . 
jeremiah ,  what are you doing ? 
what ?  ! 
no .  much bet .  .  .  i mean ,  much more sinful than that . 
jam has yet to do an overnight with us . 
i did it !  i did it !  we won ! 
simplicity ,  hawk . 
well ,  here we are back at fucking school again . 
eyowch !  this is one hot pizza ! 
i don &apos;t even think you have a gun ! 
good morning ,  mongrels ! 
are you afraid ? 
i feel bad for his family . 
beg pardon ? 
uhh .  .  .  sure .  and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal ,  in this case the wormhole ,  or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered . 
that .  .  .  is highly unlikely .  you &apos;re talking about an act of god . 
i &apos;m not following you . 
when can i squeeze one out ? 
why do i have to sleep with donnie ?  he stinks . 
did you tell them that i flooded the school ? 
that &apos;s not what i heard .  now they think i did it . 
you have a request ? 
so .  .  .  you just moved here ? 
i should go .  for physics .  monnitoff says i have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind . 
don &apos;t knock soap .  without it ,  disease would spread rapidly .  if we ran out .  .  .  you and i would never live to see the year 2000 . 
the best thing about soap is that it &apos;s the only thing on earth that can never get dirty .  no matter what crap you throw on it .  .  .  it always rubs off .  and there it is again .  .  .  perfect . 
where are we going ? 
what happened to your neck ? 
so ,  we call them .  .  .  imgs . 
you want to skip fourth period and go to the ridge ? 
hey . 
will you still be working at yarn barn ?   &apos;cause that &apos;s a great place to raise children . 
grandma death . 
i have to take the girls to los angeles tomorrow . 
know what ? 
grandma death . 
you &apos;re right .  roberta sparrow was famous for her gem collections .  kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time .  over the years .  .  .  as she got older ,  she became more and more of a recluse .  .  .  now she just likes to stay up there all by herself . 
what else do you think about during school ? 
a sign from whom ? 
i &apos;d like to believe that i &apos;m not .  .  .  but i &apos;ve just never seen any proof .  so i just choose not to bother with it .  it &apos;s ,  like ,  i could spend my whole life thinking about it .  .  .  debating it in my head .  weighing the pros and cons .  and in the end ,  i still wouldn &apos;t have any proof .  so .  .  .  i don &apos;t even debate it any more .  because it &apos;s absurd .   i don &apos;t want to be alone .   so ,  does that make me ,  like ,  an atheist ? 
yes .  i went to jail . 
hungry hungry hippos . 
i think now that he might .  .  . 
because i &apos;m so horny . 
i can see him right now ! 
donald ,  an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god .  you are an agnostic .  an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god .  .  .  but does not deny the possibility that god exists . 
what &apos;s her name ? 
yeah .  .  .  well ,  that &apos;s not the way the world works .  if you keep being too honest ,  the world will eventually find a way to destroy you . 
gerald . 
i think you are afraid to ask me for advice .  i think that you are a very troubled .  .  .  confused young man .  i think you &apos;re searching for answers in all the wrong places . 
if that &apos;s what you think is necessary . 
he was a year ahead of us ? 
rose . 
all right !  7 : 55 .  everybody goes home . 
where is she ?  ! 
mommmm !  i &apos;ll be right behind you in the hearse !

then i demand an apology ! 
wait a minute .   what kind of an army do you think we oughtta have ? 
that &apos;s funny ,  we &apos;ve got five thousand horses but no men . 
firefly must be captured at any cost . 
if any man should come between a husband and his bride ,  we find out which one she prefers by letting her decide .   if she prefers the other man ,  the husband steps outside; we stand him up against the wall and pop goes the weasel ! 
you don &apos;t understand .   this is my niece vera . 
oh yes !   -  -  upstart ! 
why  -  er  -  mrs .  teasdale  -  this is an outrage !   this man is impossible .  .  .  my course is clear .  .  .   this means war .  .  .   you runt ! 
why  -  er  -  -  my husband passed away .  .  .   i was with him to the very end . 
your excellency ! 
your excellency ,  the eyes of the world are upon you .   notables from every land are gathered here in your honor  -  -   this is a gala day for us . 
well  -  -  they might come better but they don &apos;t come any bigger .  .  .  and the bigger the better .   the bigger the betta you &apos;ve got on a horse ,  the more you lose ,  and speaking about horses ,  why don &apos;t you marry me .  come ,  come  -  -  say yes and you &apos;ll never see me again .   i &apos;ll go  &apos;way if it means your happiness .  .  . 
my purse has been stolen  -  -  the plans of war are in it . 
i said  -  i suspect the secretary of war . 
but  - 
your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis .   without his country &apos;s financial aid  -  - 
ambassador !   i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator . 
oh .   then there his somebody else ? 
mrs .  teasdale ,  i &apos;m willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency . 
oh yes .  you have so many nice things ,  and so much room . 
did it go well ,  darling ? 
what do you mean ? 
perhaps you &apos;re just polishing a stone ,  endowing this elephant man with qualities he doesn &apos;t possess ? 
oh that &apos;s absurd ,  frederick .  no ,  no frederick ,  that &apos;s all wrong !  john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life .  and ,  that is completely due to you . 
don &apos;t be frightened .  he won &apos;t hurt you . 
a hospital is no place for secrecy ,  mr .  treves .  doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment .  why wasn &apos;t this patient properly admitted ,  and why is he in isolation ?  is he contagious ? 
shall we say two o &apos;clock tomorrow afternoon ? 
yes ,  i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables .  i &apos;m afraid that they weren &apos;t very encouraging ,  but they said they &apos;d bring it up at their next committee meeting ,  so we should have their answers shortly . 
oh yes ? 
how did you ,  know the rest ?  i never taught you the rest of it . 
treves .  well done . 
no ,  not that way .  broadneck and the others don &apos;t like to deal with patients directly .  it makes them queasy .  .  .  do you have any photographs of mr .  merrick ? 
but he &apos;s so afraid he &apos;s going to be carted off .  i &apos;ve promised him that won &apos;t happen . 
i &apos;m feeling very fit ,  thank you .  how is your bronchitis ? 
how long has this man been here ? 
good lord ,  freddie !  what have you got in there ? 
fair katharine ,  and most fair ,  will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady &apos;s ear and plead his love - suit to her gentle heart ? 
she &apos;s very pretty ,  your mother . 
it &apos;s all arranged .  i &apos;ll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr .  merrick .  you &apos;ll be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box . 
thank you very much . 
yyyy .  .  .  yyye .  .  .  yyyess . 
why ,  my dear mrs .  mothershead ,  how good of you to join us .  mr .  merrick ,  will you please introduce yourself ? 
john ,  may i introduce you to sir carr gomm . 
good morning ,  john . 
you did this for me ? 
is it the one you wanted ? 
stand up ,  john .  let them see you . 
good .  excellent .  now then ,  mrs .  mothershead ,  i want you to come into this room with me .  inside there is a man with a rather .  .  .  unfortunate appearance . 
yes .  .  .  well ,  i want you to clear up a little mess ,  a breakfast tray was spilt .  and bring up another breakfast .  when you &apos;ve done that ,  you and i shall give the man a bath .  but ,  mothershead ,  i &apos;m counting on your many years of experience to get you through this ,  above all ,  do not scream ,  do not cry out ,  or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him .  .  . 
parrots can do as much ,  mr .  treves .  it &apos;s all very nice ,  but i don &apos;t see the point .  you know they won &apos;t let him stay here . 
aren &apos;t you being just a little harsh ,  mothershead ?  you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived . 
mr .  treves ,  some more books arrived for mr .  merrick . 
a dressing bag ? 
so you see ,  john ,  there &apos;s no need for a lighthouse .  all your friends are here . 
just one of the curious .  i &apos;d like to see it . 
who ?  who ?  whoever you &apos;ve got in here of course ! 
please !  please !  what are those ? 
i &apos;ve never loved anybody ! 
halfdan the black . 
i don &apos;t want to live without you . 
is it night or day ,  erik ? 
have you ever seen the sun ,  erik ? 
no .  .  .  we don &apos;t .  .  . 
what &apos;s the matter ,  don &apos;t you want to hear our singing ? 
your majesty !  we come from a world where there is no music .  where men live and die by the axe and by the sword .  .  . 
the gods are asleep ,  king arnulf . 
it &apos;s all part of our safety regulations .  you see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then .  .  .  well .  .  . 
i &apos;ll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone . 
to pay for the next expedition ,  of course . 
you told them i raped you  -  -  why ? 
i &apos;ve come to take you back to the land of the living . 
why ? 
erik !  row !  what are you doing ? 
what &apos;s wrong with making friends ? 
i .  .  .  i .  .  .  killed her .  .  . 
shut up ! 
that &apos;s better . 
listen !  maybe we won &apos;t get to hy -  brasil !  maybe we won &apos;t find the horn resounding .  .  .  but at least we &apos;ve tried .  .  .  and at least we shall have died like men . 
wait ,  erik ! 
what do you think ? 
don &apos;t you see ,  erik !  she wants revenge ! 
nobody &apos;s ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard . 
look ,  i bagged it last week . 
you coming ?  you don &apos;t even believe in asgaard . 
you know ,  my son ,  our lord said .  .  . 
and a sort of slightly sick feeling ? 
for your own sake .  .  .  for the others .  .  .  i .  .  . 
wasn &apos;t it ,  keitel ? 
keep your mouth shut ,  keitel ! 
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair .  .  . 
there !  that &apos;s a true berserk . 
thorfinn !  you can &apos;t die ! 
you &apos;ll see my grandfather in valhalla ! 
and you &apos;ve got both axes ? 
and if you have to kill somebody ,  kill them !  don &apos;t stop to think about it . 
i &apos;m sorry naomi couldn &apos;t make it .  you okay ?  you seem quiet . 
no ,  it was lovely . 
you rat . 
well ,  i &apos;ve been having a bad time of it with um ,  my boyfriend ,  i guess . 
maybe gay isn &apos;t the right word .  but ,  anyway ,  it &apos;s been rough with him .  .  .  whatever the fuck he is .  heheh .  my significant other .  .  .  heh heh .  and i guess on a certain level ,  i want to break it off ,  but i feel .  .  .  y &apos;know .  .  .  it &apos;s like this constant questioning and re questioning .  do i end it ?  should i give it more time ?  i &apos;m not happy ,  but what do i expect ?  relationships require work .  you know the drill .  the thing that i keep coming back to is ,  i &apos;m not getting any younger ,  i want to have a baby .  .  .  at some point .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  right ?  so then i think i should settle  -  -  which is not necessarily the best word  -  -  i mean ,  he &apos;s a good guy .  it &apos;s not really settling .  then i think maybe i &apos;m just a victim of movies ,  y &apos;know ?  that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be .  but then i think ,  no ,  this is what i really want ,  so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it .  you know ?  agreed ?  but then i think he is a good guy and .  .  .  it &apos;s complicated .  y &apos;know ? 
rockville center . 
 -  -  because i go there all the time .  i don &apos;t think i ever saw you before . 
i noticed your hair .  i guess it made an impression on me ,  that &apos;s why i was pretty sure i recognized you . 
joel ?  it &apos;s joel ,  right ? 
where do you live ? 
yeah . 
the song &apos;s 9th and hennepin .  i spent most of the train ride trying to remember .   &quot; till you &apos;re full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin / and you spill out / over the side to anyone who &apos;ll listen .  &quot;  remember ? 
thanks . 
well ,  i go to a psychic and she &apos;s always telling me i &apos;m psychic .  she should know .  do you believe in that stuff ? 
me neither .  but sometimes i have premonitions ,  so ,  i don &apos;t know .  maybe that &apos;s just coincidence .  right ?  y &apos;know ,  you think something and then it happens ,  or you think a word and then someone says it ?  y &apos;know ? 
sorry .  my life isn &apos;t that interesting .  i go to work .  i go home .  i don &apos;t know what to say . 
you &apos;re really nice .  i &apos;m sorry i yelled at you before about it .  god ,  i &apos;m an idiot . 
i &apos;m nervous .  you don &apos;t need to be nervous around me ,  though .  i like you .  do you think i &apos;m repulsively fat ? 
i &apos;ll pack a picnic  -  -  a night picnic  -  -  night picnics are different  -  -  and  -  - 
let &apos;s talk about it later . 
oh ,  thank god .  it &apos;s going . 
more ? 
look at you ,  cutey !  what are we doing ? 
joel ! 
do you remember what we talked about ? 
right .  something black though . 
joel ,  i &apos;m not a concept .  i want you to just keep that in your head .  too many guys think i &apos;m a concept or i complete them or i &apos;m going to make them alive ,  but i &apos;m just a fucked - up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind .  don &apos;t assign me yours . 
i had you pegged ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
probably . 
c &apos;mon ,  man .  the water &apos;s fine .  nobody &apos;s coming here tonight ,  believe me .  this place is closed up .  electricity &apos;s off . 
so go . 
what if you stay this time ? 
so you &apos;ll call me ,  right ? 
listen ,  did you want to make love ? 
 -  -  and i &apos;m just too nervous around you right now . 
how &apos;s it going ? 
how &apos;s the chicken ? 
she &apos;s so sexy . 
naomi . 
your back to me .  in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually .  at the time i thought ,  how cool ,  an orange sweatshirt . 
we can help you through this .  why don &apos;t you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine . 
hi ,  rob and carrie . 
say hi to rob and carrie .  have some fun ! 
so .  .  .  you haven &apos;t been involved with anyone in all this time ? 
so you think the dissertation will get published ? 
so i &apos;m going to get some sleep .  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re okay . 
boo . 
it &apos;s just .  .  .  y &apos;know .  .  .  i mean .  .  . 
it &apos;s stopped . 
no way .  i can handle this . 
i know what it is . 
order me a pastrami for after ? 
okay ,  we &apos;re back in . 
yeah ,  yeah it is ,  howard .  and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didn &apos;t know . 
there &apos;s another one i like ,  i read .  it &apos;s by pope alexander . 
i &apos;ve loved you for a very long time .  i &apos;m sorry !  i shouldn &apos;t have said that . 
thanks .   so .  .  .  do we talk about this .  .  .  or what ? 
you made me have you erased !  i loved you .  i love you !  how could you  -  - 
i think he &apos;s in a conference .  unfortunately .  i &apos;m really sorry . 
this book  -  -  it &apos;s essential that people read it because  -  -    -  -  it &apos;s the truth .  and only i know it . 
yeah ? 
she was beautiful .  so sweet and funky and voluptuous .  i kind of stole a pair of her panties ,  is what . 
but i don &apos;t know how to polka . 
what was that ? 
every time i tell you that i love you ,  you flinch .  but that &apos;s your problem . 
countess .  i &apos;m really in a dither .  she &apos;s turned my head . 
but i don &apos;t want you to leave .  please stay .  we can go to dinner .  i owe you a dinner .  and tonight .  .  .  we can .  .  .  really make love . 
going north ? 
freak ,  schmeek .  most of us are freaks in one way or another .  try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you &apos;ll see what i mean . 
you were the yoni yum girl from ,  let &apos;s see ,   from nineteen sixty - eight through nineteen seventy .  you &apos;ve always smelled so nice .  like a little sister .  the irony has just killed me .  you ,  the dew girl ,  one of the few girls who doesn &apos;t need dew .  i loath the stink of females !  they are so sweet the way god made them ,  then they start fooling around with men and soon they &apos;re stinking .  like rotten mushrooms ,  like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool ,  like a tuna fish &apos;s retirement party .  they all stink .  from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean ,  they stink . 
 .  .  . and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before . 
solid as a rock .   hey ,  smith .  .  . 
coffee . 
you weren &apos;t there .  i saw it . 
i don &apos;t know what happened to justin . 
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion . 
how ?  the bridge is gone . 
he &apos;s a rescue technician .  peters ,  medical technician .  dj .  .  . 
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations ,  impaired judgement .  .  . 
they thought it said ,   &quot; liberatis me ,  &quot;   &quot; save me ,  &quot;  but it &apos;s not  &quot; me .  &quot;  it &apos;s  &quot; tutemet :  &quot;   &quot; save yourself .  &quot; 
please .  .  . 
please .  .  .  kill .  .  . 
i &apos;ve got a pulse ,  he &apos;s alive .  .  . 
90 over 50 and falling .  .  .   . 
intubate ,  pure oxygen feed ,  get the nitrogen out of his blood .  .  . 
it &apos;s against my better judgement ,  but i &apos;ll run this by the man downstairs .  you &apos;ll know my decision by the end of the day . 
 .  .  . it &apos;s inside and it eats and eats until there &apos;s nothing left . 
dr .  weir ,  you have no experience with salvage procedures . 
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation ,  dr .  weir ,  but it doesn &apos;t factor into this . 
that means they didn &apos;t abandon ship . 
we &apos;re a long way from home and we &apos;re in a bad place .  let &apos;s not make it worse .  if anyone has any constructive suggestions ,  now is the time . 
is that your  &quot; expert opinion ?  &quot;  the only answer we &apos;ve had out of you is  &quot; i don &apos;t know .  &quot; 
you said this ship creates a gateway .  .  . 
where has it been for the past seven years ? 
you can &apos;t leave .  she won &apos;t let you . 
heading three - three - four .  .  . 
we &apos;re past the outer marker ,  we can engage the ion drive whenever you &apos;re ready . 
it tastes bad . 
the antennae array &apos;s completely fried ,  we &apos;ve got no radio ,  no laser ,  no highgain .  .  .  no one &apos;s going to be coming to help us . 
oxygen is not the problem . 
it &apos;s building up with every breath we take .  and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot . 
weir activated the drive .  he &apos;s sending us to the other place . 
weir . 
dr .  weir ,  what &apos;s this the door to ? 
no .  i saw nothing . 
there &apos;s no one in the corridor but us . 
yes .  yes ,  justin ,  we heard it . 
you can &apos;t do that . 
a straight line . 
what are you doing ? 
i &apos;m not really dressed for a party . 
you look like an eighties rock band . 
about me ?  how sweet . 
what do you want ,  vic ? 
reed said it &apos;d be weeks till  -  - 
what did you wish for ,  honey ? 
he &apos;s financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century . 
he knew about nasa .  what if he made the call to shut us down  -  - 
isn &apos;t that your speech ? 
i don &apos;t know .  i just keep going over and over the numbers . 
you go through something like this ,  makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life . 
are you alright ? 
we had a tough year . 
yeah ,  well ,  his eyes say different . 
where .  .  .  where am i ? 
no more cracks about how i look . 
me like - y . 
you &apos;re on fire ! 
now what is up with that ? 
twenty ?  from outside the place looks a lot taller . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to calculate .  and it &apos;s not rubber .  it &apos;s muscle ,  tendon .  i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to  -  - 
johnny .  supernova . 
you &apos;re really cramping my style here . 
sweet . 
you two need a time - out . 
what are you doing  -  - 
front page ? 
as far as crew ,  i was hoping ben could pilot the mission  -  - 
it has to be the cloud .  it &apos;s fundamentally altered our dna . 
it &apos;s not  &quot; invisibility &quot;  per se .  you &apos;re bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field .  that &apos;s what you projected on the bridge . 
but we &apos;re the focus ,  right reed ?  reed .  .  .  ? 
reed .  how close are we to a cure ? 
when i walked out ,  i waited ten minutes outside your door .  ten .  waiting for you to come find me . 
i can .  .  .  make it work . 
not until ben is back inside ! 
 &apos;scuse me . 
if you &apos;re trying to cheer me up you &apos;re doing a helluva job  -  - 
reed &apos;s gonna fix me up  -  - 
go ahead .  just make it quick . 
everyone wants to know where lisa is .  how should i know where lisa is ?   what am i gonna do ?  now my little sister goes to the same high school .  the party &apos;s over .   so who do you have first period ?

you &apos;re not going to tell me ,  are you ? 
come on .  clean that counter off brad .  let &apos;s go .  play ball . 
did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way ? 
well ,  that &apos;s exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi . 
i want you to know that it &apos;s your final decision if we should continue or not . 
oh .  hi . 
doesn &apos;t sound free to me .   so you want me to pay for it ? 
it &apos;s never too soon !  girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes . 
don &apos;t talk to her .  let her know .  use your face .  use your body .  use everything .  this is what i do .  i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that .  .  .  girls do respond .  something happens . 
that &apos;s the idea ,  rat .  that &apos;s the attitude . 
hey ,  mark .  is that you ? 
are you linda barrett ? 
merv ,  this is the action down at sunset cliffs at about six in the morning . 
who &apos;s that ? 
he is . 
what the fuck is this guy doing ?

he gave me his card .    &apos;ron johnson ,  audio consultant .  &apos;

there .  .  .  there &apos;s his car .  i know he &apos;s at work tonight .  he hasn &apos;t come into swenson &apos;s since he called my house .  my mother told him i was still at high school ,  after i told him i was nineteen .  i guess i should tell him i &apos;m fifteen . 
all right !  here &apos;s another one .   &apos;the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first ,  you climax first ,  you and your mate climax together ?  &apos;

where ya comin &apos; from ,  young man ? 
god hell !  i think i see the pattern !  this one sounds like real trouble !  you &apos;re going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over .  as your attorney i must advise you that you &apos;ll need a very fast car with no top and after that ,  the cocaine .  and then the tape recorder ,  for special music ,  and some acapulco shirts .  .  .   this blows my weekend ,  because naturally i &apos;ll have to go with you  -  -  and we &apos;ll have to arm ourselves . 
we won &apos;t make the nut unless we have unlimited credit .

let &apos;s go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose . 
what limes ? 
not me .  it would blast you through the wall  -  -  stone dead in ten seconds and they &apos;d make me explain it ! 
you bastard !  you &apos;d do that ,  wouldn &apos;t you ? 
the cops ? 
lucy . 
as your attorney ,  i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline . 
i saw these bastards in easy rider ,  but i didn &apos;t believe they were real .  not like this .  not hundreds of them ! 
read the newspapers . 
what could they do ?  the guy that took the head was about six - seven ,  and maybe three - hundred pounds .  he was packing two lugers ,  and the others had m - 16s . 
what &apos;s wrong with you ?  hell ,  somebody has to do it . 
sure .  it &apos;s all on the q . t .  ,  but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line . 
man ,  your head would swell up like a watermelon ,  you &apos;d probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours .  .  .

come on ,  baby don &apos;t try to tell us you never heard of the grange gorman .

oh ,  and don &apos;t bother to make up the room .  that way we won &apos;t have to risk another of these little incidents ,  will we ? 
careful . 
my god damn foot is gone !  who fuckin &apos; shot me ?  who fuckin &apos; shot me !  ? 
i think i know where a cb is .

and no people . 
that &apos;s me ,  clifford . 
 &apos;but how do i know you love me ?  &apos;
mama .  .  . 
don &apos;t listen to him ,  little sister .  when you &apos;re proud of what you are ,  you don &apos;t refuse the label ,  understand ? 
it &apos;s your fan mail ,  little sister . 
say you promise . 
mama ,  shut up ! 
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath ? 
you were hoping for a kind word ?  !  you &apos;re my mother !  you &apos;re supposed to nourish me !  support me ! 
thanks are hardly necessary . 
do you expect me ,  for one moment ,  to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do ? 
this whole thing is a joke ! 
 .  .  . i &apos;m sorry to keep you waiting ,  the staff review ran over .  did you enjoy your mother &apos;s visit ? 
no .  .  .  what i mean is .  .  .  i &apos;m just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life ,  that &apos;s all . 
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country ? 
you were with him at the end . 
and he drove me to mine . 
i &apos;ve never been shown a kindness .  show me one now . 
friends ?  do they live around here ? 
why ,  victor ?  why ?  what were you thinking ? 
stolen memories .  stolen and hazy .  they taunt me in my dreams .  i &apos;ve seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her .  whose woman was this ?  i &apos;ve seen boys playing ,  splashing about in a stream .  whose childhood friends were these ?   who am i ? 
nothing .  still nothing . 
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time .  they say he never arrived . 
i wish to be your wife . 
you make me weak . 
captain ,  i implore you .  the men are frightened and angry .  they want your assurance . 
are you having me on ? 
we catch a few hours sleep where we can .  usually here at your bedside . 
what happened up there ? 
paracelsus ? 
electricity . 
you &apos;re awake .  i &apos;ve prepared some broth .  it &apos;ll help restore you . 
how is it you come to be here ? 
your men are right to be afraid . 
we are kindred ,  you and i .  men of ambition .  let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits .  i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man . 
it &apos;s just this place .  the storm .  that &apos;s why you &apos;re all upset . 
the killer is still out there . 
you think you &apos;re gonna last all summer ? 
how come you &apos;re leaving ? 
filmmaker . 
help you clean up ? 
i &apos;ll be along . 
you said we were special . 
give me a hand ? 
no wonder they lost america .  how could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that ?  what &apos;s to eat ? 
i love you . 
he keeps on acting like such an asshole ! 
looks like a storm . 
this is no dream .  want to escape for a while ? 
doctor .  now ,  if you were a flavor of ice cream ,  what would you be ? 
you okay ? 
wait &apos;ll you &apos;re really in trouble and see what happens .  .  . 
you can &apos;t go back there tonight .  not in that stuff .   &apos;less you wanta get drownded . 
how much do i owe you ? 
whatsamatter with you ?  are you crazy ? 
we got about two more hours of day light left .  that &apos;ll get us into el paso ,  which is right next to the border .  we &apos;ll stop at a motel  -  - 
now ,  you listen to me .  you ain &apos;t gonna do a goddamn fucking thing ,  you hear me !  nobody cares what you think ,  i &apos;m running this show ,  i make the decisions . 
okay ,  i &apos;ll kill you when you change ,  i swear to god in jesus christ &apos;s name . 
what &apos;s your name ? 
how does that happen ?  you don &apos;t look japanese . 
i seem to have touched a nerve .  don &apos;t be so sensitive ,  pops ,  let &apos;s keep this friendly .  but you &apos;re right ,  enough with the getting to know you shit .   now ,  there &apos;s two ways we can play this hand .  one way is me and you go round an &apos; round all fuckin &apos; night .  the other way ,  is we reach some sort of an understanding .  now ,  if we go down that first path at the end of the day ,  i &apos;ll win .  but we go down the second ,  we &apos;ll both win .  now ,  i don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass about you or your fuckin &apos; family .  y &apos;all can live forever or die this second and i don &apos;t care which .  the only things i do care about are me that son - of - a - bitch in the back ,  and our money .  and right now i need to get those three things into mexico .  now ,  stop me if i &apos;m wrong ,  but i take it you don &apos;t give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice ,  or the bank getting its money back .  right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter ,  your son and possibly yourself .  am i correct ? 
didn &apos;t think so .  so ,  as i was saying ,  i &apos;m willing to make a deal .  you behave ,  get us into mexico ,  and don &apos;t try to escape .  i &apos;ll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning . 
swear to god ,  on the bible ,  you won &apos;t try to escape and you &apos;ll get us across the border . 
he backed down . 
yeah . 
yeah ,  we got a bible . 
how many bullets left ,  kid ? 
yes ,  it does ,  kelly .  we have already alerted the mexican authorities .  they intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice . 
awww ,  it &apos;s just been a shitass day .  every inch of it hot and miserable .  first off ,  nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick ,  so that mongoloid boy of hers was workin &apos; the grill .  that fuckin &apos; idiot don &apos;t know rat shit from rice krispies .  i ate breakfast at nine ,  was pukin &apos; up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty . 
what do you want from me ?  i did what you said . 
he comes in here every day and we bullshit .  he &apos;s used my toilet a thousand times .  if i told him no ,  he &apos;d know something was up . 
are you tellin &apos; me i &apos;m not good enough to drink here ? 
all i &apos;m saying  -  - 
shit ,  i started to get worried .  where the fuck ya been ? 
yeah ,  i saw the border .  through binoculars from on top of a high building .  that &apos;s about as close as i risked getting .  what &apos;s the tv say ? 
you just called me a fuckin &apos; nut . 
i don &apos;t know ,  you just passed out . 
that &apos;s what you think ? 
b . o . q .  ,  south side .   take a starboard tack out the door . 
wow .  .  . 
 -  -  and now i got reporters from toadsquat ,  iowa ,  calling my office and askin &apos; what i know about this  &quot; g . i .  jane &quot;  thing . 
so .   we &apos;re still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this  -  -  for integrating the spec - recon training .   it may not always be smooth ,  but we &apos;re trying to make it as painless as possible for you . 
what i resent ,  lieutenant ,  is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment .   what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men .  .  .  the day - care center i have to build where an officer &apos;s lounge used to be .  .  .  and the ob / gyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears .   but most of all ,  lieutenant ,  i resent your perfume ,  however subtle it may be ,  competing with the aroma of my fine three - dollar - and - fifty -  nine cent cigar ,  which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities .   does it ? 
then good night . 
sir .   if tomorrow .  .  .  i was not under your command .  .  .  would the inquiry still go forward ? 
well ,  if you had to go over my head ,  lieutenant ,  that &apos;s the way to do it .   christ ,  nothin &apos; like a 0 - 200 call from the commander and chief to get the bowels movin &apos; . 
fine by me ,  sir ! 
she made it through s . e . r . e .  training .   got a call this morning from  -  - 
 .  .  .  last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service ,  particularly in the land - based maritime specialties .  what &apos;s more ,  the navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on  -  - 
so everyone i talk to says you &apos;re top drawer with silk stockings inside . 
you know him . 
what the hell is the president trying to do ?   steal dehaven &apos;s thunder ? 
hey .   you okay ,  flea ? 
really don &apos;t wanna be captured ,  el -  tee .   heard some bad things . 
the navy cross .  .  . 
just a coincidence ? 
well ,  guess i don &apos;t even need to be here .  .  . 
i &apos;ve been trying you for five days .  don &apos;t they give you messages ? 
c &apos;mon ,  jordan .   do the headwork with me . 
instructors typically pull three year assignments .   this guy &apos;s in and out in one year  -  -  your year .   that sound right ? 
made it to week 10 last time . 
at first . 
she part of the training ? 
 &apos;cool ? 
so we got two full mini - tanks ,  three minutes each .    &apos;cool ?   how much air in yours ? 
say again ,  sir ? 
any brothers ?   sisters ? 
why didn &apos;t you shoot the woman ,  o &apos;neil ? 
that &apos;s what your crew said .   are they lying ?   or are you ? 
got it . 
well ,  who the shit you think you are ?   comin &apos; in here like that ? 
i just wonder how that happened . 
maybe we should call the coast guard . 
all right .   so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way ? 
who the hell are all these people ? 
great stuff ,  animal .  weren &apos;t you scared ? 
yeah .  why are you asking ? 
don &apos;t you think we have enough ? 
think we can fit up in there ? 
that was eight years ago .  some people change ,  you know . 
if the military are listening ,  they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape . 
did romeo have a name ? 
four years .  girl ,  i &apos;m surprised he didn &apos;t ask you to marry him . 
hey ,  do you have any glue in your bag ? 
mr .  caiman .  .  . 
i can &apos;t . 
make sure they find that nest before it &apos;s too late . 
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten . 
when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone . 
only five ,  sir .  we &apos;ve checked them all .  he hasn &apos;t used any of them . 
that is our job . 
look ,  i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field . 
you know ,  he &apos;s not an enemy trying to evade you .  he &apos;s just an animal . 
we think there &apos;s a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area . 
we know . 
i am a patriot .  i love my country .  can you understand that ? 
three eggs .  i thought there would be more . 
who the hell are you ? 
this is it ? 
i avoided capture using the mak &apos;tar stealth haze .   where is everyone ? 
~hex !   alex ,  are you okav ? 
not again .  .  . 
you were holding it upside down weren &apos;t you ? 
and note the sucked in gut . 
oh .   okay . 
commander ,  as i was saying .  .  .  in  &quot; the quasar dilemma &quot;  ,  you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override .  but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix ,  so we were wondering where the error lies ? 
 .  .  .  yes ? 
i knew it !  .  .  .  i knew it !  .  .  . 
brandon .  .  just in case i die ,  there &apos;s something i have to know .  .  . 
commander ,  you and lt .  madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals .  tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom .  .  . 
no ,  wait ,  are you - 
what ?   up ? 
that &apos;s it ? 
structural damage at 68 percent . 
 .  .  .  what does that mean ? 
you okay ,  alex ? 
i know .  .  .   you contruct a weapon .   look around ,  can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe ?  .  .  . 
we~re oetting hammered ,  jason .   return fire ? 
who we are .  don &apos;t you think they &apos;re going to be pissed ? 
well you have to tell them .   what if something happens ?  we &apos;re actors ,  not astronauts .  .  .  we can &apos;t do this stuff ! 
are they behind us ? 
can it be repaired ? 
clenched jaw .  .  . 
what ?   what did he say ? 
so .  .  .  we get to shut down the neutron reactor ? 
uh .  .  .  i hate to break it to you jason ,  but i don &apos;t know how to shut down a neutron reactor ,  and unless you took a learning annex course i don &apos;t know about ,  i &apos;m pretty sure you don &apos;t know how to shut down a neutron reactor either . 
unbelievable . 
that &apos;s it ,  it &apos;s go time . 
i heard it too . 
listen ,  i &apos;d like to ,  but frankly .  .  i &apos;m not even sure where it is ,  or even .  .  . 
is it a bomb ?   a booby trap ?   tell me ! 
commander ,  i must speak to you .  it is a matter of supreme importance .  .  .  we are thermians from the klatu nebula ,  and we require your help .  i beseech you to come with us ,  back to our ship .  a great many lives hang in the balance .  .  . 
sir ,  i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol ,  but please ,  i beg you to hear our plea .  we are thermians from the klatu nebula .   our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth &apos;h &apos;ar sarris of fatu - krey .  sarris wants the omega 13 .  we are to meet in negotiation .  however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous .  the flames ,  the death .  .  .   please captain ,  you are our last hope .   we have secured a limousine . 
commander .  .  .  welcome to the protector ii .   would you like to don your uniform ? 
an interstellar vox . 
to our brave guests .   few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes .   we are blessed to count ourselves among them . 
then how did he find out about the device ? 
former commander ? 
commander .  .  . 
you said we do appearances together ,  or not at all .  &apos;
what &apos;s going on ? 
well ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  this was a device we .  .  .   discovered on an alien planet .   we don &apos;t know what it does either . 
where ? 
anything . 
oh ,  right ,  sorry . 
pedal to the metal tommy .  .  . 
what ?  wh
some say that hessians are invincible . 
we &apos;ve got to attack the british !  now !   have they put you in charge yet ?   do we have an army yet ?   what is happening ? 
damn - it !   you &apos;ve given us a whole new season ,  benedict !   and congress thinks that the british are going to ride right over us come spring .  now half their army is back in canada . 
you ,  you just need a new flint ,  general . 
no uniforms .   no coats ,  even ?   in this weather ? 
what sort of boots would you say he &apos;s wearing ?   i should say ,  no sort of boots at all .   aren &apos;t those rags wrapped around his feet ?   is that what he marched here in ? 
what the goddamned hell do you think you are doing !  ? 
captain alexander hamilton ,  sir ! 
what are we going to do ? 
if he supports the british why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them ?   unlike general lee .  .  .  who you and congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent ! 
they are .  .  .  friends of congress . 
however ,  through my relations with members of his majesty &apos;s court ,  i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people ,  united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england .   vive la france !   vive l &apos;amerique ! 
and how rusty are these muskets ? 
our beloved father ,  the king ,  also refuses to bend . 
of course ,  if it were that simple .   these people ?   they &apos;re after something else .  .  . 
the day tom jefferson frees a slave i &apos;ll ride naked through the streets of williamsburg on a mule .   tom jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small .   the only man out there who really does what he says is sam adams and everyone thinks he &apos;s crazy .   believe me ,  this  &apos;disturbance &apos; isn &apos;t going to last long .   you have to understand ,  congress is a chicken coop full of foxes ,  martha ,  each and every one has his eye on a nice ,  fat prize . 
when i was a young man we used to recite cato .  .  .  we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven .   devotion to country ,  duty ,  purity of heart .  .  .  purity of heart .   i was drunk on something then .  .  . 
martha .  .  .  what ? 
not today . 
they &apos;re finished ,  they can &apos;t help us anymore !   they &apos;ve done their duty ,  general greene ,  now you do yours ! 
colonel washington ?   colonel nathanael greene ,  rhode island militia . 
a horseshoer ? 
no .   we &apos;re all of us after something .   it &apos;s easy for me to fight for the common man .   my father could only dream that i would be .  .  .  a general someday ?   and what of my daughter or son ?   i know what i &apos;m after .   but now ,  with all this talk about compromise ?   it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope . 
sir ,  i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform .  .  . 
is it ?   william says now you have requested a british commission ,  why not colonial ?   i &apos;ll clear it up for you ,  sir ,  because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels  -  -  more than that ,  it will even get you into polite society !  your dream come true ,  george ,  the only dream that really matters to you . 
now that is a lie !   see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet !   when you break off your engagement to martha curtis ,  i &apos;ll divorce william !   do you hear ?   you get what you want from this world ,  then throw it all away on love ! 
so ,  you are william &apos;s wild young neighbor ?   or should i say ,   &apos;brother &apos;; william claims you as a member of his family .   i have heard so many unflattering tales about you ,  and i understand ,  that except for you ,  this  &apos;family &apos; is quite cultivated . 
do you ?   when i saw those men yesterday in the field .  .  .  and the women and children in those hovels ?  i &apos;m not so sure if america is as far from england as i &apos;d hoped . 
i &apos;ve been surprised in an unguarded hour ,  but must not now go back; the love that lay ,  half smothered in my breast ,  has broke through all ,  its weak restraints ,  and burns in its full lustre .   i cannot ,  if i would ,  conceal it from thee . 
is that your test of patriotism ,  george; if a man will die for you ? 
for god sake ,  get that horrid stuff off your face .   you look like a damned slave !   it &apos;s damned humiliating . 
william ,  we &apos;ve been studying hard ,  i really know my stuff . 
cat ,  that &apos;s the lamest idea i &apos;ve ever heard . 
his foot .  jeez ,  poor ronnie .  .  . 
listen ,  tonight ,  later on ,  i got one for you doesn &apos;t involve any heavy work .  i want you to go have a look around chili palmer &apos;s hotel room . 
he &apos;s gonna plea - deal his way out .  give up this ace stunt man now one of the west coast dope kings ,  if they go easy on the cat . 
i think i pulled my quadriceps . 
he comes up here with our product .  he suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars .  he never shows up .  meanwhile ,  my sister &apos;s going crazy calling me all the time worried about him .  me ,  i just wanna know what happened to my focking money . 
says here you &apos;re getting martin weir for the part of lovejoy . 
no shit ,  come on .  how you gonna do that ? 
title &apos;s the first thing &apos;s got to go .  and the guy &apos;s name .  i mean ,  even this writer &apos;s name ,  murray saffrin is better than  &quot; lovejoy &quot;  . 
get something going there . 
yeah ,  i read it .  i was just thinking you could make her older .  we might even be able to get karen flores . 
that &apos;s all there is to it ,  huh ? 
i &apos;m at 8150 wonderland avenue .  it &apos;s right off laurel . 
you broke in my house and i have a witness to it . 
bo .  i &apos;m great .  listen ,  i &apos;m expecting some people  - 
okay .  then be good enough to hand us our money back ,  or you think about us coming in on this new one . 
your wife a lakers fan ? 
something shouldn &apos;t be there . 
that &apos;s the idea .  i &apos;ll think about it . 
anyway ,  you want this guy ,  he &apos;s in l . a .  we put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the keno room . 
hey ,  chil ?  since you &apos;re goin &apos; out to l . a .  anyway . 
karen ,  say hello to chili palmer .  chili ,  this is karen flores . 
that &apos;s it ?  that &apos;s your movie ? 
you pack a gun ? 
what does that mean ? 
one of his best parts . 
you don &apos;t say any more &apos;n you have to .  you say ,   &apos;well ,  i &apos;m glad you assholes stopped by ,  so i can set you straight .  &apos;
is he giving you a check or cash ? 
you cut straight hair in this place ,  or just fags ? 
you got a miss .  leo devoe .  guy &apos;s six weeks over . 
we talk different ? 
you mean like we don &apos;t give a shit . 
so you want to know . 
one we &apos;re producing . 
no ,  i want you to look at me the way i &apos;m looking at you .  put it in your eyes ,   &apos;you &apos;re mine ,  asshole ,  &apos; without saying it . 
what you &apos;re telling me ,  you &apos;re tired ?  you wanna go to bed ? 
that &apos;s what i think of you ,  asshole .  nothing . 
at that point ,  basically ,  that has to be it . 
now you &apos;re down to three - ten in the case .  you must &apos;ve cooled off quite a bit since you got here . 
the door from the patio ,  in back . 
but a week .  that &apos;s a hundred and fifty percent a year . 
i know i &apos;m better than what i &apos;ve been doing the last ten years ,  walking around in a tank top and fuck - me pumps ,  waiting till it &apos;s time to scream . 
tell you what ,  i &apos;ll stop by harry &apos;s office and pick up a copy for you . 
that why you came over here ,  to ask me that ? 
i was never much into it .  all that bullshit having to do with respect .  it &apos;s bad enough having to treat those guys like they &apos;re your heroes ,  having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think &apos;s real funny . 
well actually ,  martin the movie we came to talk about is mr .  lovejoy . 
you don &apos;t mean a movie star ?  more like a character actor ? 
were you scared up there ? 
you don &apos;t act like it ? 
i &apos;ll be right back . 
no ,  you just broke his fuckin &apos; nose instead . 
all i know is he came by the barber shop ,  all fuckin &apos; undone ,  wanting to know where you were staying in vegas .  i told him i don &apos;t know .  i still don &apos;t . 
yeah ,  but whose point of view ? 
yeah ?  what three words ,  harry ? 
hello ,  doris . 
yeah and i &apos;m wondering ,  how did it go wrong ?  how did it all .  .  .  slip away ? 
but you are interested ?

mother fucker ! 
what &apos;s this ? 
dreamin &apos;s all any of you &apos;re gonna be doing if we don &apos;t get this boat running . 
can &apos;t you use something else ? 
do what you need to do .  just do it fast . 
well ,  they &apos;re gonna be asking a lot of questions .  about us .  about those bodies .  about the gold .  seems like we oughta be prepared is all . 
yeah .

what &apos;d he look like ? 
sudden flashes of light .

ever heard of the mary celeste ? 
why not call for help ? 
guess that &apos;d be me .  again . 
just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio . 
the same day she supposedly went down . 
 &quot; their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision .  distress calls have been made .  &quot; 
the page &apos;s missing .  then their sos was real . 
it &apos;s a good bet they &apos;ll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too . 
why you ?  how come the rest of us haven &apos;t seen these people ? 
what do we do with him ? 
what do you think ? 
murphy ,  don &apos;t you see what &apos;s happening ? 
yeah . 
i been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn &apos;t moved .  i can &apos;t raise it on the radio either .  makes me think it might be in trouble . 
nobody &apos;s going anywhere with that gold now .  anybody tries to board ,  we &apos;ll know about it .   you can do what you want ,  greer .  but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that . 
what seems to be the trouble ,  ladies ? 
that cost me twenty grand at least . 
you &apos;re kidding ,  right ? 
someone from the past . 
hi .   look ,  i &apos;m kind of tired  -  i think i &apos;ll go to bed . 
pumpkin ,  are you in there ? 
i - i &apos;m not sure .  .  .  yeah ,  maybe . 
hey ,  it &apos;s nearly nine already  -  we &apos;re gonna have to leave now if we &apos;re going to make that movie . 
who is this ,  enid ? 
these are all valid comments ,  but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this . 
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ? 
well they &apos;re forcing me to give you a non - passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition .  .  .  but don &apos;t worry  -  -  i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll be able to get you your diploma in the fall ! 
so josh .  .  . 
do you want something to drink ? 
what do you mean  &quot; why &quot;  ? 
hi enid . 
i know ,  i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict !  she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she &apos;s little miss perfect and everybody loves her . 
what ?  why ? 
what do you do if you &apos;re a satanist ,  anyway ? 
hi ,  al !

you &apos;re better at it . 
what does it stand for ? 
shut up ! 
what &apos;s going on now ?  what &apos;s he doing ? 
what &apos;s he doing now ? 
i &apos;ve been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we &apos;re like these totally rich yuppies .  .  . 
what was that all about ? 
i totally ,  totally hate you . 
you won &apos;t believe it !  guess ! 
when are you finally going to get your diploma ? 
anyway ,  now we can start looking for the apartment .  .  .   do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment ? 
this is it ?  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re selling some of this stuff . 
do you still want to go to that thing tonight ? 
what ?  when did you see josh ?  ! 
what ?  !  it looks totally normal .  .  .  what &apos;s wrong with it ?

 .  .  . are you waiting for a bus ? 
thanks for the tape  -  i &apos;ll have to pay you later ,  i &apos;m broke . 
why do you even want it ?  it would look stupid on you . 
yeah ,  it took a while before i got a chance to play it ,  but when i heard that song it was like  -  - 
yeah ,  that &apos;s good too .  .  .  the whole record was good ,  but that one song ,   &quot; devil got my woman &quot;   -  -  i mostly just keep playing that one over and over .  .  .  do you have any other records like that ? 
wow !  this is like my dream room !  are these all records ! 
god ,  look at this poster !   i can &apos;t believe this room !  you &apos;re the luckiest guy in the world !  i &apos;d kill to have stuff like this ! 
i  -  i &apos;d really rather not .  .  . 
relax ,  seymour ,  relax .  .  . 
so ,  why did you bring this along ? 
this bar &apos;s going to be packed with girls for you to pick from . 
what are we ,  in slow motion here ?  !  what are ya ,  hypnotized ?  have some more kids ,  why don &apos;t you ?  .  .  .  for christ &apos;s sake ,  would you move !  ? 
jesus .  .  . 
we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn &apos;t a total idiot ,  that &apos;s all . 
yeah ,  well ,  i can &apos;t relate to humanity either ,  but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s totally hopeless .  .  . 
what the fuck ,  seymour ?  !  what is this ? 
what is that ? 
oh ,  hi .  .  . 
actually ,  it &apos;s kind of still happening .  .  .  she &apos;s over here right now .  .  .  i think everything &apos;s going pretty well .  .  . 
boo ! 
no ,  no .  .  .  not exactly .  .  .  she just doesn &apos;t understand how i would know somebody like you .  .  . 
what &apos;s up ? 
where did you get this ? 
i &apos;m just being realistic . 
who cares ?  let &apos;s just go .  .  .  what &apos;s stopping us ? 
i was just thinking out loud .  .  .   i mean ,  you &apos;ve got this whole thing with dana  -  -  i &apos;m not going to let you fuck that up .  .  . 
i really want to talk to you .  i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said about moving in here .  .  . 
seymour ?  you gotta be kidding me ! 
talk to us about it .  .  . 
uh .  .  .  hi .  uh .  .  .  enid &apos;s stepmother told me i &apos;d find her here ? 
no .  .  .  they said she was here .  .  . 
uh ,  do you mind if i wait ?  i really need to talk to her . 
maybe she &apos;s with josh ? 
she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating  -  i thought maybe she was .  .  . 
really ,  i don &apos;t know enough about it to .  .  . 
what do you mean ? 
no hints ,  samuel . 
lovely sound -  they seem happy . 
i &apos;m going to try and locate redbeard -  i assume you &apos;ve heard of him . 
i know it &apos;s your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey -    - but what are you going to do about it ? 
we all have our reasons .  mine is simply to make them understand happiness ,  accept salvation ,  know the serenity that comes -    - best i stop .  one of the by - products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring .  but i know god smiles on me . 
excellent .  could i see the bridge site ?  
finish your tour ? 
i &apos;m sure you mean that to be comforting ,  but - 
i &apos;ll try -  but this feels so different -  that old lion i killed could never carry off a man singh &apos;s size . 
got me out of trouble . 
the best way to ensure the kill when you &apos;re using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter .  have you ever led trackers ? 
samuel says you killed a lion . 
goddammit ! 
meant to ask you -  the railroad car trap .  your idea ?   excellent notion -  i used the same device myself once . 
good luck . 
we should construct thorn fences around every tent area .  fires burning at night . 
oh yes ,  i think so .  
good news ? 
where is it ? 
afraid of lions . 
did you ever see a lion that size ? 
my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder .  our lives have crossed because two lions went mad .  but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity ?  was that worth all the lives ?  too soon to tell . 
we &apos;ll be very sorry to lose you .   perhaps i could take you to lunch today ? 
do you need anything ?   you want me to come in ? 
dana ,  aren &apos;t you going to introduce me to your friend ? 
if this is what the world will be like ,  i don &apos;t want to live in it . 
hundreds of people .   believe me ,  i didn &apos;t imagine this . 
what are you working on ,  egon ? 
occasionally
hiya ,  oscar .   what do you say ,  slugger ? 
i have .   that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t call you first . 
his name is oscar . 
you &apos;re really good ,  you know . 
does she know anything about babies ? 
sorry ! 
look ,  i &apos;ve had it with you .   get your stuff together ,  get back in that clown car and get out of here .   this is a city matter and everything &apos;s under control . 
i &apos;m not sure this is such a good idea ?   do they know you &apos;re doing this ? 
we don &apos;t go around altering valuable paintings ,  dr .  venkman . 
you know ,  i never got to ask you .   where you from ,  johnny ? 
keep that up ,  mister ,  and i &apos;ll find you in contempt . 
sustained .   mr .  tully ,  do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case ? 
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out ,  didn &apos;t she ? 
i &apos;m telling you ,  we &apos;re all going to be in big trouble if we don &apos;t do something fast .  that ghost guy came and took my friend &apos;s baby and we got to get it back .   it &apos;s just a scared little baby ,  sherm . 
this is my cousin sherman .   sherm ,  say hello to the ghostbusters .   i promised him a ride in the car if he got you out . 
hi ,  welcome back to the  &apos;world of the psychic ,  &apos; i &apos;m peter venkman and i &apos;m chatting with my guest ,  author ,  lecturer and of course ,  psychic ,  milton anglund .   milt ,  your new book is called the end of the world .   isn &apos;t that kind of like writing about gum disease .   yes ,  it could happen ,  but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it ? 
this year ?   that &apos;s cutting it a little close ,  isn &apos;t it ?   i mean ,  just from a sales point of view ,  the book just came out ,  right ?   so you &apos;re not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year .   and it &apos;s going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie - of - the - week or mini - series potential .  you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even  &apos;94 just to be safe . 
yes ,  i did .   we were city champs . 
so ,  dr .  venkman ,  please explain to the court why it is you and your co - defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street . 
how &apos;ve you been ?   how &apos;s teaching ?   i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours ,  huh ? 
you were supposed to help me with this . 
it &apos;s working .   the positive gev &apos;s are climbing . 
i &apos;m egon  -  - 
six feet  -  -  seven  -  -  eight  -  - 
don &apos;t shoot !   you &apos;ll hit ray ! 
well ,  holmes ,  what do you think ? 
that &apos;s it ,  ray .   i &apos;ve had it .   no more parties .  i &apos;m tired of taking abuse from over - privileged nine - year - olds . 
does it have any favorites ? 
and he didn &apos;t die of old age either .   he was poisoned ,  stabbed ,  shot ,  hung ,  stretched ,  disemboweled ,  drawn and quartered . 
tell him about the toaster . 
hey ,  sweetheart ,  will you cut that out !  !  ! 
ready ?   what is it ? 
incredible !   five for five .   you &apos;re not cheating on me here ,  are you ? 
okay .   just give me a second here .   i have to leave now but if you &apos;ve got some time i &apos;d like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me . 
oh ,  no ,  i feel great .   i just ordered some more vitamins .   i see you were exercising .  so was i .   i taped  &quot; 20 minute workout &quot;  and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and i got a really good workout .  you wanna have a mineral water with me ? 
are you the gatekeeper ? 
hello .   i &apos;m peter venkman .   may i help you ? 
no ,  just that one word  -  -  zuul  -  -  but i have no idea what it means . 
you really don &apos;t act like a scientist . 
if it &apos;s any comfort to you ,  i don &apos;t think you &apos;re crazy . 
i want to help you . 
can &apos;t you tell me now ? 
what &apos;s he doing in my refrigerator . 
he is the destructor . 
this is preposterous !   i demand an explanation . 
but why ?   the students love us ! 
egon ,  there &apos;s something very strange about that man .   i &apos;m very psychic usually and right now i have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you .   i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to die . 
have it your way ,  mr .  venkman . 
all right .   what is it ? 
nervous ? 
oh ,  this is big ,  peter .   this is very big .  there &apos;s definitely something here . 
just for your information ,  ray ,  the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75 , 000 . 
you talked to gozer ? 
i &apos;ve got to sleep . 
you said you floored  &apos;em at the regents &apos; meeting . 
for what purpose ? 
i &apos;m getting high readings near the air vents .   it must be using the duct system to get around .   see ,  i told you we &apos;d get something . 
boy ,  that was a rough one . 
me ,  too . 
you don &apos;t have to worry about that with us ,  sir . 
i should at least have you ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
did narcissus die today ?   wasn &apos;t this his day to die ? 
no one in rome has ever heard of him .   do you want to remind those few in the senate who have ?   the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with .   forget about him . 
it &apos;s disgusting !   animals !   i had to come here under armed guard .   slaves  -  -  get this junk out of my sight . 
tribuus .  .  .  tomorrow . 
now that is a happy sound !  tomorrow ,  i want the citizens  -  -  my people  -  -  back in the arena .   the gods know ,  i &apos;m tired .   come to bed ,  now; tonight we &apos;re celebrating . 
 &quot;  .  .  .  encased in the armor of a demigod ,  narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast .  .  .  &quot; 
you and my father have become very close .   perhaps one day i may say the same for us . 
insubordination .   to the emperor .  .  .  and the senate . 
the senate is out to sink you .   i swear it ,  caesar ,  your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor .   your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of janus when you must be confirmed the senate will be able to deny you . 
we must obey our emperor and the senate . 
why isn &apos;t he dead ?   damn you ,  you promised me he would be dead ! 
yes ,  caesar ? 
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory .   thanks to marcus aurelius . 
a republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes .   at the core he &apos;s a man who believes in doing what &apos;s right . 
you &apos;re a citizen and a soldier .   not a gladiator . 
no future - telling ,  please ,  i &apos;ve been terrified enough for one day . 
to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman .   read to sleep on catullus ,  lucretius .  .  .  virgil .  .  .  every night .   my beautiful daughters . 
servis made it through again ? 
a man should be upright ,  not be kept upright .   history shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities  -  -  even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute .   i want you to consider becoming my heir . 
i made the plume from a quail feather . 
i see the emperor &apos;s little boy has finally caught up with the army . 
serious stuff .  .  . 
everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal . 
it &apos;s your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons . 
well ,  you wanted the girls to have the best teachers . 
you &apos;re not going !   you have to stay with us ! 
you &apos;re a legate in the roman army .  huh .  .  .  ?   and you act like one .  what was your crime ? 
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth .   take my advice and make that bet . 
before they leave ,  get gold . 
hello . 
are you going to graduate school ? 
do you always drive like this ? 
will you take me home now ? 
listen  -  -  could you stop crying ,  please ? 
what is the matter ? 
with a family ? 
all right . 
i do . 
why aren &apos;t you ready ? 
no  -  -  don &apos;t cry  -  - 
don &apos;t cry .  
no .  i want to know why you &apos;re here in berkeley ? 
is it because i &apos;m here ? 
do you just hate everything ?  how could you possibly rape my .  .  . 
she said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend .  you waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night . 
can i just sit here while you &apos;re packing ? 
don &apos;t you have it on ? 
when ? 
we just can . 
you really will ? 
why wouldn &apos;t it ? 
who  -  -  that guy at the zoo ? 
how did he do it ?  did he get down on his knees ?  he didn &apos;t get down on his knees ,  i hope . 
benjamin ? 
you &apos;re not one of those agitators ? 
one of those outside agitators . 
see  -  -  she &apos;s just having some water .  now there &apos;s no need for the cops or anything . 
i &apos;m putting it on the top step . 
where are you ? 
oh  -  -  yes .  the singleman party . 
sir ? 
how are you ,  benjamin ? 
is it a girl ? 
benjamin ,  i want to ask you something . 
i want you to come in till i get the lights on . 
drink ? 
mrs .  robinson ,  you didn &apos;t  -  -  i mean you didn &apos;t expect  -  - 
i don &apos;t remember her as having brown eyes . 
yes ? 
thank you . 
do you understand what i said ? 
yes ,  i do . 
sure .  shall i  -  -  i mean shall i just stand here ?  i mean  -  -  i don &apos;t know what you want me to do . 
benjamin  -  -  do you find me undesirable ? 
that you &apos;re afraid  -  - 
 -  -  of bring  -  -  inadequate  -  -  i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way  -  - 
what ? 
what ? 
now let &apos;s keep going here . 
right . 
well how long has this been going on . 
how many times a year . 
man ,  is this interesting . 
wait a minute .  so you wouldn &apos;t say you loved him . 
but you don &apos;t hate him . 
wait a minute .  wait a minute .  so how did it happen ? 
i mean did he take you up to his room with him ?  did you go to a hotel ? 
don &apos;t talk about elaine . 
i &apos;m good enough for you but i &apos;m too slimy to associate with your daughter .  that &apos;s it ,  isn &apos;t it ?  isn &apos;t it ? 
now listen  -  -  this was not my idea .  it was my father &apos;s idea . 
mrs .  robinson ,  don &apos;t wreck it .  i &apos;m asking you please not to wreck it . 
what have you done to her ? 
i say i &apos;ve got it . 
why did you say that ? 
i &apos;m not .  but i &apos;m  -  -  i &apos;m not very proud of what i do .  i usually get kind of drunk .  i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk .  then i take a hotel room .  so i won &apos;t have to drive home on the freeway .  i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after  -  - 
when did you two talk this over ? 
well  -  - 
how do you know ?  you haven &apos;t seen her since high school .  i guess your evenings ,  whatever you do with them ,  are just too valuable . 
here .  it looks like you need a refill . 
ben  -  -  i want you to give her a call . 
is there something i &apos;ve said that &apos;s caused this contempt ?  or is it just the things i stand for that you despise ? 
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you ,  mr .  robinson .  i am trying to tell you i do not resent you . 
huh ? 
life ,  gentlemen ,  is wonderful ,  but very dangerous .  you must have courage for it ,  then it &apos;s wonderful .  you gentlemen don &apos;t know that because you are all healthy and happy ,  but i  -  -  believe me  -  -  a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life . 
time &apos;s getting short . 
i want to speak  -  - 
how ? 
i &apos;ll pay you back . 
whoever is keeping you waiting . 
reducing ? 
lord no  -  -  charming  -  -  but why one meal a day ? 
too bad . 
i &apos;d given you up . 
i &apos;ll do anything for you . 
flaemmchen ,  what are you doing here in the middle of the night . 
but surely you must know  -  -  because i love you . 
so you feel like coming into a lady &apos;s room  -  -  and you come .  .  .  what now ? 
why do you look at me like that ? 
and  -  -  and  -  - 
you could love me .  it is so long since i have heard that word .  nobody has loved me for a long time .  it is so icy - cold to be famous .  one is so cruelly alone .  how is it that you  -  -  let me look at you .  your hands .  your eyes .  why could you love me ? 
grusinskaya .  .  .  oh  -  -  oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya  -  -  for the success of grusinskaya  -  -  for the triumph of grusinskaya .  .  .  and what is she now ?  just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases  -  -  are you listening to me  -  -  do you understand ?   -  -  i want you to understand . 
why do you smile ? 
no . 
the veronal  -  -  you .  i &apos;m going to stay here with you . 
and now ? 
very early in the morning . 
can &apos;t  -  -  can &apos;t you  -  -  couldn &apos;t you come too  -  -  i think it would be better  -  -  for us  -  -  for us both . 
then you know him ? 
that was my last . 
perhaps you could present me now ,  mr .  pimenov . 
it seems that he was a thief and an imposter . 
you must learn as quickly as your time allows  -  -  believe me mr .  kringelein ,  a man who isn &apos;t with a woman is a dead man . 
there is no pocketbook here .  .  .  on the floor probably .  
mr .  kringelein  -  -  how you have changed ,  you look so nice . 
no  -  absinthe . 
you must look at my face and not at the floor . 
really ? 
you &apos;ll have a good time with me .  want to ?  i &apos;ve got enough money .  ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook .  three thousand four hundred that i won .  it will last a long time .  i can win more  -  -  we &apos;ll travel . 
what .  .  .  !   -  - 
oh  -  -  too bad .  did you quarrel ?  
i must go to england  -  -  at once . 
you see ,  i &apos;d like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and  -  -  humm  -  -  humm  -  -  for company on the trip  -  -  i &apos;m nervous  -  -  i need somebody  -  -  i don &apos;t know if you quite understand me .  you said you have travelled with gentlemen  -  -  and i mean  -  - 
no water  -  -  what a place ! 
goodbye ,  preysing ,  i hope you pull through .  this is a very bad time to be in such a crisis .  we &apos;ve .  .  . 
what ? 
mr .  preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties .  .  . 
let us cancel the engagement . 
madam ,  it is mr .  meierheim  -  -  he is waiting downstairs . 
he will be on the train . 
mr .  kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance . 
it &apos;s a very nice room and inexpensive ,  sir . 
the gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty - nine . 
i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow .  i can &apos;t speak without notes .  i like to have things down before me in black and white . 
you must go to manchester at once yourself and really see it through . 
she had an engagement in the yellow room at five o &apos;clock  -  -  she was in a hurry . 
one question .  do you want to stick to that story ,  or do you want to keep your teeth ? 
now i &apos;ll ask you another .  you think i got no contacts out here ?  that nag paid off at just the opening price .  there wasn &apos;t hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted .  there ain &apos;t enough action to tickle the tote ,  but you claim a ten grand win !  you send me ten thousand dollars ,  like i &apos;m some mark you can blow off ! 
what the fuck are you doin with a son ? 
almost forgot .  that ten grand of yours .  it &apos;s in the envelope by the door . 
i &apos;ll put you in one thirty - one .  very quiet .  faces the desert . 
well ,  i &apos;ll have to take your word for it ,  mary beth .  here &apos;s your money . 
cole ,  it &apos;ll be all right .  honey ? 
mrs .  dillon ,  your son was in some sort of accident .  he &apos;s had an internal hemorrhage ,  he &apos;s bleeding to death inside . 
you &apos;ll give us an opportunity to serve you again ,  i hope .  if there &apos;s anything you think we might be interested in .  .  . 
sounds like a good idea . 
perk ,  remember ? 
i thought .  .  .  i was hoping we could play it straight with one another . 
i sat in there with her ,  i thought ,  what do i do now ?  run and i &apos;ve got bobo and the law after me .  stay ,  and how do i explain ? 
i need this ,  roy .  i can &apos;t run without money ,  and if i can &apos;t run i &apos;m dead . 
a job ?  i &apos;ve never had a legit job in my life ! 
roy ,  i know what to do with myself !  it &apos;s a big world out there . 
and to survive ,  my way ,  i need money .  bobo knows about the stash in the car ,  so i didn &apos;t dare touch it ,  not if lilly dillon &apos;s dead .  so that leaves this . 
a bad mother .  by any standards .  i &apos;ve thought about it ,  you know ,  from your side ,  since then .  i know just how bad i was . 
i wonder did you ever think about it from my side . 
well ,  uh .  .  . 
if i should get out of the racket ,  that goes double for you .  that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to change your life completely ,  go to some town ,  get a square job ,  live like a john yourself .  if you try to do it your way ,  what future is in it ? 
roy .  .  .  what if i told you i wasn &apos;t really your mother ?  that we weren &apos;t related ? 
i don &apos;t see why you &apos;re still here .  you look healthy to me . 
i don &apos;t see why we have to take the train . 
what if we want to drive somewhere while we &apos;re there ? 
no . 
nobody does that single - o . 
oh ,  roy ,  it was great !  we were rolling in dough ,  lived wherever we wanted ,  only pulled two or three scams a year . 
think about it .  okay ? 
that &apos;s what i say . 
mostly ,  because you scare the shit out of me .  i &apos;ve seen people like you before ,  baby .  double - tough and sharp as they come ,  and you get what you want or else .  but you don &apos;t make it work forever . 
by god ,  it &apos;s your mother .  it &apos;s lilly . 
what ? 
where ,  judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints ,  she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell . 
the killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought - iron poker . 
as which point she drops to her knees in pain .  .  . 
yes . 
okay ,  then how  &apos;bout we ask you a few questions ? 
shit ,  john !   what the hell were you doing out there ?  ! 
it &apos;s an option . 
oh ,  so now it &apos;s my fault ? 
i &apos;m not leaving without her . 
oh ,  god .  .  .  no .  .  .  not molly . 
keri .  .  .  .  laurie .  .  .  how about if i just call you mom ? 
swiped it from my mom &apos;s desk yesterday . 
you really think eddie killed her ? 
molly ,  of all the people .  .  .  if i can &apos;t trust my resident assistant ,  then what ? 
okay ,  tell you what .  .  .  you can still be the school r . a .  ,  but no dance tomorrow night . 
aren &apos;t they doing a terrific job this year ? 
still wants to move out ? 
the tighter you squeeze ,  the harder he &apos;ll try to break free . 
i &apos;m going into town .  .  .  run a few errands before dark .   need anything ? 
my name hasn &apos;t always been keri tate .   it was once laurie strode . 
what &apos;s this ? 
ooooh ,  busted . 
shane &apos;s going as a condom . 
blaaaaaggghhhhh ! 
what are you doing there ?   where &apos;s my mother ? 
is tim there ? 
jesus ,  that &apos;s my neighbor .   tommy . 
they did ,  did they ?   since when did we start listening to the kids at school ? 
you &apos;ve been watching too much tv . 
john ,  they sound jamie lloyd this morning !  someone tried to kill her ! 
god  .  .  .  this can &apos;t be true . 
so they &apos;re trying to kill you and your baby .  don &apos;t tell me .   your name also happens to be rosemary . 
halloween . 
where &apos;s the baby ?  ! 
danny !   danny ,  where are you ?  ! 
we need you ,  dr .  loomis . 
there you are .   who was that boy ? 
yes ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but do i know you  -  - 
right now at least one girl is dead and jamie lloyd is in there fighting for her life .   she is the last of his blood line .   if she dies  -  - 
who else knew i had the baby ?  ! 
hm ? 
home is important to a man . 
you know what gets me ? 
i know ,  i know .   i dunno .   at least she &apos;s in the same house .   sure was spooky ,  looking in the window there ,  and there she was . 
i &apos;ve been looking at motorcycles . 
and how were things ? 
fourteen times you told me .   i counted . 
go live in a safe - deposit box -  - with your things .  looseleaf jesus -  - i wouldn &apos;t want to be married to him .   you know ? 
i didn &apos;t like that violin thing .  that was sad . 
hello . 
would somebody please pass me the catsup ? 
insurance ! 
what an awful sound ! 
who &apos;s going to fly our helicopter now ? 
how do you know how i &apos;d act in africa ? 
anybody home ? 
ask it ! 
the doctor was called away on an emergency .   i think it was birth . 
college ! 
as in  &quot; death ,  where is thy sting ?  &quot;  he killed at least fifty men ,  wounded hundreds more . 
hid by day -  - fought by night .   at sunset one day ,  your father and i ,  peering through field glasses ,  saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn .   it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car .   out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history -  - the beast of yugoslavia . 
mhravitch .   remember that name . 
he seems to think they are .   he told me that were . 
mom ? 
of course it is .   is it loaded ? 
dad -  - 
how do you do .   my name is penelope ryan .   this is a simple - minded play about men who enjoy killing -  - and those who don &apos;t . 
 &quot; hamburger heaven .  &quot; 
not at all . 
your old beau ? 
i don &apos;t want that chancre mechanic in here . 
we all are . 
i rang .   it seemed like the proper door for a servile ,  worthless organism to use . 
i came for paul as well . 
he cried . 
what kind of a country has this become ?   the men wear beads and refuse to fight -  - and the woman adore them .   america &apos;s days of greatness are over .   it has drunk the blue soup . 
he &apos;s a child ! 
it &apos;s still just death ,  the absence of life -  - no honor at all .   it &apos;s worse than the blue soup by far -  -  that nothingness .   to you ,  though ,  it &apos;s the honor that crowns them all . 
no . 
and my son ,  the only son of harold ryan -  - he &apos;s going to grow up to be a vanisher ,  too ? 
this is suicide .   go get the police . 
i mean it ! 
help your mother find the bullet . 
ooops . 
look -  - this isn &apos;t my apartment ,  and there isn &apos;t anybody else here .   mrs .  ryan won &apos;t be home for a while . 
just her neighbor and doctor ?  that &apos;s all ? 
how was the emergency ,  doctor ?  profitable ,  i hope . 
you &apos;ve been bitten by bats ? 
this is man to man . 
you intend to crack my eardrums with your voice ?   will i bleed from my every orifice ?   who will clean up this awful mess ? 
you &apos;re old -  - so old . 
i &apos;m an honorable clown ? 
i put a poisoned thought in your head .   even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind .   it &apos;s saying ,   &quot; obsolete ,  obsolete ,  obsolete ,  &quot;  and ,   &quot; clown ,  clown ,  clown .  &quot; 
no . 
can &apos;t do it . 
mr .  ryan just borrowed my birthday cake .   i don &apos;t really know him . 
i &apos;m only ten years old . 
something &apos;s made you sore . 
you bet i &apos;ll worry about it .   i said something wrong ? 
no . 
where will you be ? 
then who flushed the toilet ? 
i didn &apos;t get his name .   a friend of your father ? 
he &apos;d kill me .   he &apos;d be right to kill me ,  too -  - the kind of guy he is . 
he &apos;d assume we had . 
if you want to wrestle ,  you got lehigh .   if you want to play tennis ,  you go to vanderbilt . 
yes ? 
this conversation took place ,  incidentally ,  about three months before harold was declared legally dead . 
coming . 
gentlemen !   is this right for a fight ?   it &apos;s been so long . 
did you talk to paul ? 
thank you ,  herb .   you &apos;re a wonderful man .   you really are .  everybody respects you for what you &apos;ve done for scouting and the little league . 
i &apos;m saying no -  - and thank you . 
it &apos;s true . 
they made her so sleepy she couldn &apos;t work . 
what kind of a life is that ? 
or get eaten alive . 
phooey . 
start with the smallest weights .  every week add a pound or two . 
i &apos;d like to place a  &apos;personals &apos; ad in the free press . 
hello .  you want some information ? 
we offer .  .  . 
what do you think of this .  .  .  ah ,  shade of blue ,  mary . 
yeah .  he &apos;s a nice guy .  don &apos;t lose him .  maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit .  it &apos;s a little .  .  . 
are you sure it &apos;s all right ? 
are you niki ? 
say what ? 
how important do you think sex is ? 
what does that mean ?   what does he do ? 
do they believe in reincarnation ?  i believe in reincarnation . 
i can stop if you want . 
i &apos;ll admit it &apos;s confusing from the outside .  you &apos;ve got to see it from the inside . 
as i was saying ,  i &apos;ll pick up the thread .  there &apos;s a number of ways i can go .  there &apos;s not much you can do here .  stay if you want .  maybe it &apos;d be better if you went back home .  go through kristen &apos;s personal stuff .  ask around ,  maybe she knew somebody out here .   look ,  i do this a lot .  i work at a minimum rate of $750 . 00 a week .  it may seem like a lot of money to you ,  but it ain &apos;t .  you could hire cheaper . 
yeah .   all over .  even here in grand rapids . 
i &apos;m only human ,  you know . 
do the police want to arrest me ? 
you know ,  it &apos;s possible to buy anything on this earth .  you can buy child whores ,  slaves .  you can have people raped ,  killed .  .  .   one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan .  he usually isn &apos;t in this country .   how &apos;d you hear about him ? 
hey man . 
jim sullivan .  sometimes they call me jism jim . 
i hear you got money to spend .   i hear you &apos;re interested in .  .  .  interesting things . 
meet me here today at seven o &apos;clock .  with the money .  then we &apos;ll go see the film . 
you wait here .  i &apos;ll find out where she is . 
that film was a fake !  everything &apos;s phony .  .  . 
this is from the movie i was talking about . 
i wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman .  .  .    .  .  . right here . 
well ,  bill  -  -  mind if i call you bill ?   let me be frank .  i &apos;ve made a lot of money .  i &apos;ve got my own business in detroit .  rivets .  i make rivets and sell them to fisher body .   well ,  rivets ,  you know ,  can get pretty boring after a while .  when my business manager told me i should shelter some money ,  i thought i &apos;d try this . 
maybe .  maybe not . 
you can fuck off ,  too . 
hey ,  piss - head ,  what brings you around ? 
you remember me .  louise ?  rhymes with squeeze . 
was he with a girl ? 
okay ,  lady .  out . 
oh ,  don &apos;t get officious .  you &apos;re not yourself when you &apos;re officious .  that &apos;s the curse of a government job . 
i suppose they are in the truck .  are you going to take a lot of time with this ? 
oh .  well ,  what is it exactly that you do ? 
how do you do ?  i am dame marjorie chardin ,  but you may call me maude . 
do you sing and dance ? 
thank you ,  but it &apos;s an appointment .  i really shouldn &apos;t miss it . 
harold ? 
well ,  it &apos;s all very thrilling ,  of course ,  but i ask you ,  harold .  .  .  is it enough ? 
an ice sculpture .  it &apos;s venus  -  the goddess of love ,  the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream . 
a little after - dinner liqueur ,  harold ? 
no . 
okay ? 
he &apos;s stopped . 
oh ,  those motorcycles are awfully chilly . 
died !  seventeen times  -  not counting maiming .   shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood . 
with god ? 
this is really nice .  makes me feel like a kid .  i want to do somersaults  . 
that wasn &apos;t very scary . 
but ,  harold ,  we begin to die as soon as we are born .  what is so strange about death ?  it &apos;s no surprise .  it &apos;s part of life .  it &apos;s change . 
i feel giddy . 
oh ,  harold ,  don &apos;t upset yourself so . 
would you like a cigarette ? 
do you play ? 
this one is particularly interesting .  it &apos;s a hari - kari blade . 
and a lot of time . 
i see .  junkyards .  what is the fascination there ? 
you liked your teachers ? 
then why did you leave ? 
we are not relating today ,  harold .  i sense a definite resistance .  a lack of true and helpful communication .  i find you a very interesting case ,  harold ,  but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho - analytical process ,  and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment .  do you understand ? 
i see .  tell me ,  harold ,  do you remember your father at all ? 
parasite ! 
good afternoon ,  officer .  bit of trouble here ? 
tell me  -  -    -  -  is that car parked all right ? 
he .  .  .  he loved me . 
yes .  .  .  yes .  you look .  .  . 
she &apos;s done it . 
so .  .  .  you &apos;re kirsty ,  huh ? 
i .  .  .  i had a visitor . 
don &apos;t worry about it .  your attitude sucks anyway . 
i &apos;ve got to finish it . 
i &apos;m scared . 
wait ! 
how am i ever gonna get a girl ?  ?  i drive around in a garbage truck
would &apos;ya look at this babies ?  made  &apos;em myself .  holy water ,  silver shavings ,  white oak :  the works . 
remind me why i keep doing this . 
if he &apos;s here ,  this is worse than i thought . 
 &quot; in absentia luci ,  tenebrae vinciunt .  .  .  &quot; 
and as a father ,  i worry about him .   in medieval stories ,  agent myers ,  there &apos;s often a young knight ,  inexperienced but pure of heart .  .  . 
it is .  you got yourself on tv again . 
they &apos;re not speaking .  professor broom had him grounded . 
he gets fed six times a day .  he &apos;s got a thing for cats .  you &apos;ll be his nanny ,  his keeper ,  his best friend .  he never goes out unsupervised  -  - 
we should go back  -  -  you  -  -  you could tear that door apart  -  - 
thank you . 
oh .  uh .  hello .  i  -  -  i have these .  for you . 
what are you ,  a boy scout ? 
you want me to hold him down ? 
hey ,  your chili &apos;s getting cold  -  - 
out ?  out out ? 
hi . 
dr .  broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau .  no special precautions ,  no security escorts .  you and me in a taxi .  like regular folks . 
i admire him .  he &apos;s a force of nature . 
strong . 
will you sign for the bed ? 
we want the man who did this  -  - 
no . 
there is going to be a wedding ? 
what about larry  -  - 
what happened to you ? 
it &apos;s not any box .  it &apos;s called the lament configuration .  it &apos;s a puzzle . 
don &apos;t touch it .  it &apos;s dangerous .  it opens doors . 
to experience beyond anything ever known .  at least that &apos;s what i was promised when i bought it .  pleasure from heaven or hell .  i didn &apos;t much care which . 
you can &apos;t love him . 
she &apos;ll tell them everything .  .  . 
there &apos;s a towel in the bathroom . 
what happened ? 
this afternoon . 
it &apos;s one of these . 
where are you ? 
is it deep ? 
you &apos;re not going to faint . 
look ,  i &apos;m going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company . 
 -  -  i &apos;ll go see . 
larry .  .  . 
oh baby . 
what are you talking about ? 
well ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
this isn &apos;t the bedroom . 
oh christ . 
you &apos;re awake .  good girl . 
i &apos;ll get the doctor . 
kirsty ? 
you &apos;d like the house . 
i &apos;ll come over and see you in the next few days .  you can show me the mansion .  o . k .  ? 
are you o . k .  ? 
all right .   no .  that &apos;s nice . 
can i lend you a hand ? 
these things .  .  .  they want to take me  -  - 
what ? 
but it &apos;s my new tape .   my monday morning tape .   i made it last night just for today . 
you just drove a fucking customer away ,  barry . 
barry ,  i &apos;m fucking broke !   i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn &apos;t like ,  but it &apos;s gotta stop . 
what did he ever do to you ? 
we &apos;re only on the fucking list for marie &apos;s gig at the pulaski pub ,  that &apos;s all !   all three of us . 
okay .   top five side one track ones .  number one .  .  .   &quot; janie jones ,  &quot;  the clash ,  from the clash . 
 &quot;  -  -  i haven &apos;t seen evil dead ii yet ,  &quot;  yeah ,  yeah ,  i hear you  -  - 
why would they care ? 
i didn &apos;t make up the name .   it &apos;s the steely dan song .   and it was in the commitments . 
they were fucking called that before i was in it ,  okay ?   it wasn &apos;t my idea . 
none .   christ ! 
because it &apos;s in the big chill . 
liar .   we saw it in the lawrence kasdan double - bill with body heat . 
the little skate - fuckers . 
what is she doing ?   okay ,  20% . 
you couldn &apos;t be .   look ,  barry .  there &apos;s going to be people from laura &apos;s work there ,  people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums .   how are you going to cope with them ? 
great .   can i have it then ? 
mitch ryder and the detroit wheels ? 
right .   why ? 
nevermind .   any five .   so four more . 
is that it ? 
well it was a friend &apos;s idea ,  really ,  and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it .   so .  .  .   i should really put a james brown in there  -  - 
would you ?   really ?   wow .   i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home . 
rob ,  hi ,  so sorry i missed your call .  in la on business .   you know how it gets . 
good .   great .   yeah .  .  .  wow .   rob gordon .   seems like a 100 million years ago now . 
why did you break up with me for marco ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
rob . 
rob  -  -  ! 
yeah . 
 -  -  made .   made .   marvin gaye is dead ,  his father shot him in  -  - 
 -  -  alright ,  alright but  -  - 
i &apos;m sorry .   i haven &apos;t been very fair to you .   that &apos;s why i came here to the store this evening .   i feel terrible ,  rob .   this is really hard ,  you know . 
what were the others ? 
did you say something ? 
rob .   don &apos;t be childish . 
look .   maybe you &apos;ll grow up and we &apos;ll get it together ,  you and me .   maybe i &apos;ll never see either of you again .  i don &apos;t know .   all i know is that it &apos;s not a good time to be living here . 
of course it is . 
but not even before ,  when he was living upstairs ? 
yep .   i might have missed some stuff .  i &apos;m so used to some things being here that i don &apos;t even notice them . 
he &apos;s at home .   listen ,  i can &apos;t believe he went to the store .   i &apos;m mortified ,  actually .   i &apos;m really sorry .   he had no right to do that ,  and i told him so . 
you know i didn &apos;t mind .   and it &apos;s not as if ray &apos;s place is any better . 
don &apos;t worry about it .   just get into bed .   worry about that when you &apos;re better . 
c &apos;mon .   i want to know . 
what it was like . 
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex ? 
oh ,  c &apos;mon ,  laura .   just say something .  lie ,  if you want .   it &apos;d stop me asking you questions and it &apos;d make me feel better . 
i &apos;ll pay for you .   even though you owe me money .   we have to do something with the money i earn .   i need to .  i deserve it .   you can just think of it as winning the lottery . 
because i &apos;m not allowed to .   i still do ,  after work .   so ,  what ?   should we just break up ?   is that what you &apos;re saying ?   because if you are ,  i &apos;m going to run out of patience . 
all i &apos;m saying is ,  you have to allow for things to happen to people ,  most of all to yourself .   otherwise ,  what &apos;s the use ? 
i called dan koretzky because he  -  - 
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we weren &apos;t together anymore .   it might even be why i came back . 
no .   probably not . 
i &apos;ve changed my mind .   that &apos;s the most romantic thing i &apos;ve ever heard .  i do .   i will . 
to think i sympathized with you for two seconds !   poor rob !   laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs .   you let me believe that ! 
i know i can &apos;t speak now because laura &apos;s father died ,  and i just have to take it because otherwise i &apos;m a bad guy ,  with the emphasis on guy ,  self - centered .   well ,  i &apos;m fucking not ,  not all the time ,  anyway ,  i &apos;m really sorry jo .   but you know ,  liz .  .  .  i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself .   and maybe you think i should ,  but it &apos;s not much of a life ,  you know ? 
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob ,  standing and holding his jacket . 
these are worth at least ,  i don &apos;t know  -  - 
uh ,  yes i ,  like ,  do .  .  .  it &apos;s simple .  you make the tracks  -  -  recording studio  -  -  deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut ,  the master is then dubbed to submasters ,  which are the  &quot; mothers ,  &quot;  as their called ,  for each press in the plant .  you press the cd &apos;s or records ,  put in your cover art ,  and that &apos;s it . 
huh ? 
you &apos;re the expert . 
that stuff &apos;ll put you away if you &apos;re not careful . 
he was unsual . 
well ,  this is a small town ,  and it was even smaller then .   most all the babies i delivered were from local families .   richard &apos;s parents were just passing through when his mother &apos;s time came .   i did it right here at the house . 
don &apos;t know about any of that .  suppose nobody does . 
have you spoken to anyone else about this ? 
do you play ? 
grave robbers ? 
who ? 
you have an active imagination . 
why not ? 
i left a man dead in felton .   but you don &apos;t really care ,  do you ? 
i &apos;d rather hear yours . 
no .   i had to talk to you . 
what &apos;s all that ? 
when you finish ,  what then ? 
maybe it would do us both good . 
here ,  try this .   i suppose they &apos;re still making women the same as back then . 
i don &apos;t know any of these .   i &apos;ll make a fool of myself . 
william taupin seems to have left his mark . 
and you are william taupin ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
i hope i never get that old . 
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak -  nesses .   i can &apos;t stand it .   but you &apos;re different .   it &apos;s in your hands .   a clarity . 
who are you ? 
perhaps .   there is something more .  an inheritance . 
i &apos;ve got a morgue filling up with bodies .   that &apos;s my right . 
good way to lose your job . 
i don &apos;t believe him . 
your back ,  it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle ? 
it is as you are . 
but we cannot be killed . 
why ? 
the fabric of life .   the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another . 
it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds .   but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening .  for it gives you great strength .   the strength of _knowledge_ .   the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be . 
go ahead ,  senor .   i have my friend to keep me company . 
live ?   in less than a week you &apos;re prancing about the country like a squirrel . 
complete your inspection ? 
i doubt much can change that .  the enemy has five brigades waiting for us . 
i understand you joined up in bremen . 
equals ? 
we must talk . 
you see major ?   you are not so different .  .  . 
aye .   it is his duty .   all of ours . 
fish are creatures of habit .   they like their food where they &apos;re used to it .   at the top ,  hiding in old leaves . 
round up who you can and put them on standby . 
he got him .   he always does .   eventually . 
spare a chair ? 
had a great swing with his blade .  for a pope . 
i haven &apos;t drunk this much since - 
the pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth . 
you &apos;ve been here from the start . 
friend of yours ? 
tradition . 
we have some unfinished business . 
his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory . 
do you know what this is ? 
it was covered with mr .  fasil &apos;s fingerprints ,  but none of his blood . 
all i need is time . 
steven ,  conor didn &apos;t die . 
bensinger  -  -  of the tribune . 
duffy !  i &apos;m sending bensinger over to see you .   mervyn ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
too hot ? 
well ,  at his age ,  twenty payment life ,  a little over a thousand dollars . 
but  -  - 
about twenty - five hundred dollars . 
the five hundred ?  sure . 
hildy johnson .  .  .  oh ,  hello ,  bruce .  have you got it ?  is it certified ? 
hildy ! 
i waited and waited and then i had an idea and wired albany to send me a hundred dollars so i could get out on bail .  .  .   i don &apos;t know what they &apos;ll think  -  -  they sent it to the police station ! 
just a second ,  walter .  here ,  bruce ,  here &apos;s the check .  .  .  and ,  oh ,  bruce ,  here &apos;s your wallet .  i got it back . 
i know i wasn &apos;t a good husband ,  hildy ,  but you can always count on me . 
i feel i ought to take care of her . 
well ,  she &apos;ll know some day . 
no  -  -  i was just talking to one of the guys at the office .  
i know how you feel ,  bruce ,  but you &apos;ve got to forgive her .  she &apos;s only a woman ,  after all . 
oh ,  this is all right ,  bruce .  i just wanted to be sure . 
who do you think you are ,  breaking in here like this ? 
you &apos;re going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we &apos;re pulling your nose out of the feed bag . 
duffy !  get liebowitz ! 
save that for the tribune . 
you &apos;ve had a better offer ,  eh ? 
what were you when you came here five years ago ?  a little college girl from a school of journalism !  i took a little doll - faced mugg  -  - 
i don &apos;t care whether he did or not .  he &apos;s supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is  -  -  waiting at the hospital !  is there no sense of honor left in this country ? 
it &apos;ll bring us together again ,  hildy  -  -  just the way we used to be . 
i don &apos;t know about water buffaloes ,  but i know about him .  he &apos;s kind and sweet and considerate .  he wants a home  -  -  and children . 
you wouldn &apos;t believe this ,  walter ,  but bruce holds the door open for me . 
and when he walks with a lady ,  he waits for her ! 
what now ? 
you said it . 
all right ,  hildy ,  i &apos;m licked .  but i &apos;ll make you and bruce a business proposition . 
what tricks would i pull ? 
it better be fifteen minutes ,  because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter &apos;s clicking away to beat the band . 
you know !  you &apos;ve got the brain of a pancake !  that wasn &apos;t just a story you covered  -  -  it was a revolution !  hildy !  this is the greatest yarn in journalism since livingstone discovered stanley for the new york herald !  
you &apos;ve kicked over the whole city hall like an apple - cart .  you &apos;ve got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall .  you &apos;ve put one administration out and another in .  this isn &apos;t a newspaper story  -  -  it &apos;s a career !  and you stand there belly - aching about whether you catch an eight o &apos;clock train or a nine o &apos;clock train !  still a doll - faced mugg !  that &apos;s all you are . 
attagirl !  why ,  they &apos;ll be naming streets after you  -  -  hildy johnson street !  there &apos;ll be statues of you in the parks ,  hildy .  the radio &apos;ll be after you  -  -  the movies !   by tomorrow morning i &apos;ll betcha there &apos;s a hildy johnson cigar !  i can see the billboards now .  light up with hildy johnson ! 
well ,  keep going !  we want an extra out on the streets before it &apos;s too late ! 
tear into it ,  will you ?  don &apos;t sit there like a frozen robin ! 
i can &apos;t hear .  .  .  you got who ?  speak up !  a what ?  .  .  .  you can &apos;t stop for a dame now ! 
lafayette two - one - hundred . 
no ,  you don &apos;t !  walter ! 
how was that for a tight squeeze ? 
he &apos;s going to have you the rest of his life ,  hildy .  can &apos;t you give me another hour ? 
sure . 
down western avenue .  we were going sixty - five miles an hour .  you know what i mean ? 
here &apos;s that certified check ,  walter .   i drew out my wife &apos;s savings ,  and if this isn &apos;t back by 5 : 30 i &apos;m a ruined man ! 
hello ,  hildy !  what are you doing around here ? 
are you gentlemen all through with me ? 
i see .  you realize ,  however ,  that you committed a crime ? 
so have we ! 
say ,  hildy ,  if i know you ,  you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us .  are you trying to scoop us or something ? 
oh ,  you two are pals now  -  -  i think you &apos;re right ,  endicott .  mollie did give her some kind of story . 
we know what you &apos;re up to . 
how &apos;s everything ,  gus ? 
gus ,  this  -  - 
same way you did .   through that gate . 
no ,  thanks sheriff .  i &apos;m leaving town tonight . 
you can send somebody with me if you don &apos;t believe me ! 
that &apos;s murder ! 
what went off ? 
after all i &apos;ve done for you  -  - 
read it !  insane ,  he says .   he knows very well that williams ain &apos;t insane ! 
dementia praecox oh - h - h ! 
nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered .  now ,  do as i tell you . 
who is this man ? 
you drunken idiot !  arrest him !  the idea of coming here with a cock - and -  bull story like that ! 
walter ,  i can &apos;t tell you how badly i feel about this .  there was no excuse for hartwell to fly off the handle . 
we run smack into a police patrol .  you know what i mean ?  we broke it in half ! 
nobody &apos;s going to rush me into anything !   you keep away from me !  
any news ? 
if walter burns calls ,  hold the wire for me ,  will you ?  i &apos;ll be right back .  
come on with that money ! 
none of that innocent stuff ,  you double - crossing hyena !  you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch ,  and you frisked his wallet !  now ,  give me that wallet or i &apos;ll stick you in jail and it won &apos;t be on any phony charge either !  it &apos;ll be for life ! 
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .  i never said any such thing . 
i couldn &apos;t plead insanity ,  because you see i &apos;m just as sane as anybody else . 
they &apos;re very simple .  i believe in the golden rule .  i &apos;m not the first man to die for preaching it .  but if they would only listen to it  -  -  we could have a fine ,  decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things . 
it &apos;s the only answer .  everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose ,  we could solve all our problems .  food was meant to be eaten ,  not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn ,  not piled up in stores while people went naked .  doesn &apos;t that make sense ? 
don &apos;t forget about production for use . 
earl ,  you don &apos;t want to hurt your friends ,  do you ? 
i don &apos;t blame you ,  earl .   if i were in your place i wouldn &apos;t trust anybody ,  either . 
quiet ,  mollie ,  quiet ! 
where are they gone ?  you know where they are ? 
are you all right ,  now ? 
they were all standing around when he wrote it .  it was after they got back from fishing . 
how much do you make a week ?  what &apos;s your salary ? 
pinkus . 
is it hard ? 
they wouldn &apos;t take it . 
she &apos;s good enough for me !  and if i was to go home and tell my wife  -  - 
if you ask us ,  no .  if you ask the state alienists ,  the answer is yes . 
sure ,  mollie ,  you never looked better in your life . 
what &apos;s your hurry ? 
can i try ? 
what are you doing here ?  this is our territory
bloody . 
now put them together .  bugger off ,  you bloody sod . 
you couldn &apos;t . 
go and ask her if she wants to play . 
bruce ,  look !  dad got some german jam . 
who pays for them ? 
what is it ? 
where ? 
root it out clive .  .  .  the thought of it ,  before it takes hold . 
so you &apos;re going to be a grandfather . 
you joined up . 
why didn &apos;t they say that before you started ? 
and where do you think you &apos;re going ? 
now take deep breaths ,  and push . 
mac ,  that was wonderful .  i haven &apos;t been to a concert since .  .  . 
i wish it could all have been different . 
you &apos;re having me on ,  molly . 
i &apos;m so glad you could come .  here we are ,  all together again . 
cone . 
tiny &apos;s home . 
aw ,  i was going home to my mamma &apos;s house .  .  .  yeah ,  i was out doing this thing . 
what about the tree ? 
ok ,  whatever .  let &apos;s go get your brother &apos;s truck .  faster we get the truck ,  faster we get out of here . 
is your brother ready to go ? 
mmmmm ,  this is tasty . 
wondering what ? 
keep the change and get yourself a new name . 
as far a hot .  .  .  goes i gotta go with .  .  .  ruth ann moorehouse . 
shit ,  we really need to find some gas . 
yeah . 
i dunno .  .  .  we &apos;ll ask around as we get closer .  man ,  i really don &apos;t want to run out of gas out here in the middle of petticoat junction ,  man . 
she looks like she stinks . 
i like sleep . 
why are we stopping ? 
fine .  i &apos;ll go straight . 
officers ,  officers what can i do for you today ?  i ain &apos;t fried up the birds yet .  .  .  if that &apos;s what you &apos;re ring a ding dinging about . 
come on ,  get with the facts . 
what ? 
how long is that gonna take ? 
this isn &apos;t everything .  get ready for this .  .  .  there &apos;s a museum of murder and mayhem . 
yeah ? 
so what ? 
you gotta be kidding me .  this chick is wasted . 
aw ,  it ain &apos;t crap .  .  .  it &apos;s .  .  .  cute .    .  .  . and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin - can mona lisa ? 
it will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate .  this trip is fun ,  but it &apos;s starting to get brutal . 
stick her in the front ,  if you want to pick her up so bad .  she &apos;s soaked . 
recover any bodies ? 
that &apos;s the understatement of the year . 
well christ boy ,  don &apos;t stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree . 
open up the trunk . 
and i &apos;m gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples . 
think .  .  .  do any of these kids look familiar in any way ? 
otis !  otis !  come quick ,  there &apos;s cops outside . 
hey . 
turn up this road . 
mr .  willis ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  we &apos;ll find her . 
over . 
and ? 
tell him ,  harold . 
say my name . 
oh ,  hi ,  gabrielle . 
well ,  i don &apos;t know .  i &apos;m actually on my way to .  .  . 
you were wonderful today ,  darling .  such authority with the ape - man boy .  it made me so hot for you . 
call you back .   you bastard !  what do you want ? 
please .  just one minute of your time . 
anyway .  come already to the point . 
i &apos;ve moved on . 
so we &apos;ve got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements ,  my wonderful men . 
i &apos;m going alone .  this could be dangerous . 
a little resistance would be nice ,  damn it . 
very well . 
you &apos;ll thank me eventually ,  puff .  well ,  you won &apos;t thank me ,  because we won &apos;t be speaking ,  but you &apos;ll sort of thank me with a special look ,  the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you . 
oh yes ,  honey .  getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over .  smooth as a baby &apos;s butt . 
cause there &apos;s this guy .  my brother knows him .  might be right up your alley . 
handsome ,  thirties ,  psychologist .  .  . 
loves animals .  loves you . 
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine .  mr .  handsome ,  animal -  loving psychologist said he would love to meet you . 
my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan . 
no .  i married a midget . 
let me tell you ,  honey ,  midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship .  they &apos;re portable .  they &apos;re controllable .  they &apos;re eager .  and they &apos;re exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor . 
i don &apos;t know ,  honey .  i don &apos;t know .  maybe he just didn &apos;t want to get involved . 
uh ,  tie them up ,  rosie .  if you will . 
i &apos;ll be in touch . 
as do i . 
slugdom .  sluggishness .  whatever you &apos;d call it .  i &apos;m not there yet .  i still have many human characteristics . 
i love that you said that .  it makes me feel a bit lighter .  i &apos;ve been rather heavy lately .  thinking about my childhood .  realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing .   i &apos;ve been seeing someone .  a therapist . 
quite well ,  really .  it &apos;s a lot of work .  a lot of reinforcement ,  mostly positive .  right now i &apos;ve gotten two of my subjects to use napkins .  tiny napkins of course . 
it &apos;s my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice ,  they can be taught to humans . 
the truth is most people don &apos;t have table manners today .  and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear ,  civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .   i &apos;m sorry ,  nathan .  i never really learned those things . 
you do ? 
you do ? 
i &apos;m sorry about my parents . 
darling ,  did you bring the insect repellent lotion ? 
oh ,  and the sun block ? 
what spf ,  sweetie ? 
did you see that ? 
it &apos;s hormonal ,  nathan .  i can &apos;t help it .  i &apos;m sorry . 
do you like my new look ? 
really ? 
because i &apos;m really trying ,  you know .  rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis . 
yes !  and i want to help .  you won &apos;t have to pay me ,  and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway . 
who needs it ?  i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things !  i love being a woman because .  .  . 
you just have to control it .  we &apos;re not apes . 
nah .  you just relax .  how &apos;s the book ? 
aha !  finally .  i &apos;ve covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern ohio . 
this is great ,  puff .  you &apos;re doing fine . 
no ,  why ? 
hey ,  another one for me and another one for the lady . 
huh ? 
all right .  today for me ,  tomorrow for himself . 
i &apos;ll make it up to you . 
put it on the bed .  that &apos;s the way it &apos;s done ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
oh ,  we &apos;ll start small .  .  .  a hundred dollars a game . 
i &apos;m sure mr .  felson knows what he &apos;s doing .  certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out . 
will you take a check ,  bert ? 
character . 
no ,  three thousand at least .  he &apos;ll start you off at five hundred a game  -  -  he &apos;ll beat the pants off you .  that &apos;s the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is .  he &apos;ll beat you flat four or five games  -  -  maybe more ,  depending on how ,  uh .  .  .  steady your nerves are .  but he might  -  -  he just might be a little scared of you ,  and that could change things .  but i wouldn &apos;t count on it . 
wait a minute .  maybe i can help you . 
how much you think you &apos;re worth these days ?  i &apos;m puttin &apos; up the money ,  i &apos;m puttin &apos; up the time .  for that i get seventy - five per cent return on my money  -  -  if you win . 
look ,  you wanna hustle pool ,  don &apos;t you ?  this game isn &apos;t like football .  nobody pays you for yardage .  when you hustle you keep score real simple .  the end of the game you count up your money .  that &apos;s how you find out who &apos;s best .  that &apos;s the only way . 
sign up . 
what happened to you anyway ? 
he &apos;s a gentleman .  gentleman gambler .  he gets his kicks playing with hustlers .  he &apos;s got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement ,  drinks eight - year - old bourbon ,  smokes cork - tipped cigarettes . 
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ? 
i can beat him . 
hey ,  bert .  wait a minute ! 
please don &apos;t get off me now .

i heard wigand &apos;s deposition got sealed . 
since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on  &quot; 60 minutes &quot;  ? 
cbs does not do that .  and ,  you &apos;re questioning our journalistic integrity ?  ! 
no ,  not that .  i &apos;m talking about the associated press .  they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i .  did you tell them that we were lying ? 
so ,  now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  gentlemen ,  mr .  rather &apos;s been complaining about his chair again .   as they start to leave .  .  . 
and what are you implying ? 
did you handle the round ,  mr .  wigand ? 
you think i put that bullet in the mailbox myself .  .  .  ? 
you can &apos;t take that .  .  .  it &apos;s personal property .  .  .  ! 
if this holds up ,  and it very well may not ,  mike .  .  .  but ,  if it did .  and we aired this segment ?  and cbs was sued by brown & williamson ?  i think we could be at grave risk . 
his  &quot; veracity &quot;  was good enough for the state of mississippi . 
lowell ? 
is there any more rice .  .  .  ? 
two p . m .  great .  bye - bye .  
 .  .  . you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the state of mississippi ,  did you not ? 
 .  .  . i &apos;d be lying to you if i did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion .  .  . 
no shit . 
okay ,  let &apos;s look through the looking glass the other way .  .  . 
we got a guy .  .  .  who wants to talk but he &apos;s constrained .   what if he were  &quot; compelled &quot;  ? 
oh ,  man . 
did i get you up ? 
how have you liked your stay ? 
look ,  i really don &apos;t have that much time .  .  . 
doesn &apos;t cbs have confidentiality agreements ,  mr .  bergman ? 
c &apos;mere .  i want to talk to you . 
it happened after i talked to you .  i do not like coincidences ! 
 .  .  . and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction ,  disease .  .  . 
i &apos;ve always thought of myself .  .  .  as a man of science .  that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with it . 
 .  .  . okay . 
next to your father ? 
why ? 
you should .  because when you &apos;re done ,  a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion ,  my friend .  and that &apos;s the power you have . 
jeff .  .  . 
i called richard scruggs in mississippi .  .  . 
what &apos;s changed ? 
that &apos;s the whole point ,  jeffrey .  that &apos;s the whole point .  anyone &apos;s .  everyone &apos;s .  they are gonna look under every rock ,  dig up every flaw ,  every mistake you &apos;ve ever made .  they are going to distort and exaggerate everything you &apos;ve ever done ,  man .  don &apos;t you understand ? 
you try and have a good time . 
did he hear you ? 
just give me an example .  .  . 
and that &apos;s what cigarettes are for .  .  .  ? 
object to the form of the question ! 
jail ? 
jeffrey says exactly what &apos;s on his mind .  most people consider what they &apos;re saying .  .  .  social skills .  .  .  jeffrey just charges right ahead .   now ,  i know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with brown & williamson ,  jeff .  .  . 
is that a threat ? 
yeah .  i know .  leather would be more practical ,  but whatcha gonna do ? 
honey ,  i don &apos;t think this is really relevant to .  .  . 
as you are well aware ,  my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned .  i was slandered in court . 
and how is mrs .  reiser ? 
what a touching story . 
i &apos;d just like to have a word with her . 
is this mr .  dumbarton ? 
well ,  actually ,  all whores worship the dollar ,  if you want to get technical . 
objection ,  your honor ! 
who &apos;s next ,  mrs .  rabinow . 
not this one .  not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery ,  which ,  incidentally ,  she does not need . 
it &apos;s a lecoultre revers .  you can flip the face ,  and set it for two time zones . 
no .  i have the ring .  was i supposed to have a pre - nup ? 
your husband told me you were beautiful ,  but i was unprepared . 
do you have a hard heart ,  marylin . 
all right ,  miles .  let me tell you everything you think you know .  i was married to rex for a long time .  i was an excellent wife ,  a partner ,  a lover ,  a hostess and a friend .  there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together .  i got five years older .  think he should be able to ditch me for that ? 
what is it you &apos;re after ,  miles ? 
yes .  i loved my husband ,  rex . 
i &apos;d like to offer my congratulations .  that was a beautiful gesture of howard &apos;s . 
it has bones .  be sure to swallow one . 
marylin ?  when did i say .  .  .  ? 
okay .  should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for  -  - 
oh .  and that is  -  -  mom ? 
we are ,  miles .  you know i &apos;m right .  there &apos;s something  &quot; off &quot;  about you and me miles .  and maybe it isn &apos;t because of these women  -  -  maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our  &quot; deficiencies &quot;  very early on .  maybe .  .  . 
friends ? 
well .  well .  well .  look who made bail ! 
i &apos;m reporting you to the irs . 
arty farty stuff .   lithographs and pre castro cubans .  watches and mileage on private jets .  stuff ,  miles .  stuff you get from grateful clients . 
hello marylin . 
pre - castro . 
i was devastated .  of course . 
he told me to  -  -  he said he wanted me to  -  - 
do you think he set me up ?  do you think that was his intention ? 
so .  now what ? 
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow ? 
she &apos;s a legend .  didn &apos;t she do kravis or a pearlman ?  she definitely did a factor . 
lilly &apos;s up . 
every week  -  - 
i can &apos;t do this anymore .  let &apos;s get some lunch . 
 -  -  is not a challenge .  i need something i can sink my teeth into ,  professionally speaking . 
wait .  i know you . 
herb wants to see me ? 
did marylin end up with money ? 
where does that leave us ? 
mr .  rexroth . 
gotcha .  no need to get anatomically correct with me ,  rex . 
what &apos;s kirshner ? 
kenneth this is my associate ,  wrigley .  wrigley this is my friend ,  dr .  beck . 
now ,  mrs .  banderas .  what is your relationship to mrs .  rexroth . 
no .  i haven &apos;t .  but i &apos;ve been out of town .   hello ,  rex .  hello there . 
did you know mrs .  rexroth was married ? 
divorce was her childhood aspiration ? 
yeah ,  but i don &apos;t like the idea of walking in on your jamboree  .   .   .  just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain . 
mr .  warne ? 
who said anything about a reward ! 
if you had half the brains you &apos;re supposed to have ,  you &apos;d have done it yourselflong ago . 
i knocked several times . 
you &apos;ve been acting so strangely since you returned .  i &apos;mi &apos;m worried .  i haven &apos;t bothered to ask you any questionsi  isn &apos;t all this what you wanted ?   you haven &apos;t changed your mind about king ,  have you ? 
well ! 
well ,  what are we going to do about it ?  where is he ? 
might have been able to help if it weren &apos;t for you .  i &apos;ve been watched so closely ,  i
why didn &apos;t you jam it down her throat ? 
what a hell cat .  no controlling these modern girls .   they &apos;re terrible ! 
what about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that ? 
i haven &apos;t changed my mind ,  westley ,  i want you to understand that !  i don &apos;t like you !  i never have !   i never will !  that &apos;s clear enough ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
here &apos;s another wire ,  sir .  this one &apos;s from charleston .    &quot; checking every northbound train .  also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways .  no success yet .  will continue to do everything possible .  &quot;  signed :  lovington detective agency ,  charleston . 
never mind ,  son .  she doesn &apos;t want it .  
hey ,  hey ,  aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;ll burn out a tonsil ? 
what &apos;s the matter ?  wouldn &apos;t the old meanies wait for you ?   say ,  how old are you anyway ?  don &apos;t you know these busses work on a schedule ?  you need a guardian . 
you &apos;ll never get away with it ,  miss andrews .  
i never thought of that . 
if you promise not to snap my head off ,  i &apos;d like to thank you . 
a dollar sixty !   .   .   .  you had four dollars last night !  how do you expect to get to new york at the rate you &apos;re going ? 
that ,  i suppose ,  makes everythinguhquite all right . 
yes ,  you do .  you think i &apos;m a fool and a spoiled brat .  perhaps i am ,  although i don &apos;t see how i can be .  people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way .  i never have .  on the contrary ,  i &apos;ve always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom .  would you believe it ?  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever been alone with a man ! 
well ,  you don &apos;t have to lose your temper ! 
aw ,  nuts !  you &apos;re just like your old man !   once a plumber always a plumber !  there isn &apos;t an ounce of brains in your whole family ! 
yes ,  i noticed he was getting a little fat lately .   ouch ! 
yeah . 
your father didn &apos;t know beans about  &quot; piggy - back &quot;  riding . 
peter
i &apos;ll get my clothes all wrinkled . 
i am .  i only work when i have to .  two years ago i got a notion and went to china .  there was a war going on .  swell !  after a while it got stale .  i went down to tahiti .  just lay on the beach for six months .  what could be sweeter ? 
there it is .  better swallow it .  we &apos;re not going to have any breakfast . 
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m going around panhandling for you .   best thing in the world for youcarrots .  had a tough time getting them .  if that farmer ever caught megoodnight ! 
i wish you wouldn &apos;t talk too much .  we let a car get away .  
expert !  going to write a book on it .  called the  &quot; hitch - hikers hail .  &quot; 
but the thumb always works .  different ways to do it ,  though .  depends on how you feel .  for instance ,  number one is a short ,  jerky movement  that shows independence .  you don &apos;t care if they stop or not .   &apos;cause you got some money in your pocket ,  see ? 
oh ,  that &apos;s nothing .  now take number three ,  for instance .  that &apos;s a pip .  it &apos;s the pathetic one .  when you &apos;re brokeand hungryand everything looks black .  it &apos;s a long movement like this  with a follow through . 
what were you going to do ?  gold dig him for a meal ?  &#93 13]
oh ,  peter !  what happened ?  are you all right ? 
thank you .   am i going to see you in new york ? 
i hope you got your money . 
compared to you ,  my friend ,  shapeley &apos;s an amateur .   whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this !  you &apos;re positively the most conceited
comical part of it is ,  it isn &apos;t what you want at all .  in a couple of weeks you &apos;ll be looking for the nearest exit  .   .   .   people like you spend all your life on a merry - go - round .  i guess that &apos;s what makes you so dizzy .   you &apos;re always chasing after something .  at least you think you are .  truth is ,  you &apos;re just running away .   from yourself ,  mostly .   &apos;cause you &apos;re miserable .  you hate yourself .  the world &apos;s full of people like you .  don &apos;t know what they want . 
how are you ,  ellie ?   are you happy ? 
where &apos;s the bus to new york ? 
eight o &apos;clock tonight . 
oh ,  thank you .  thank you . 
what &apos;s the matter ?   where &apos;s your husband ,  young lady
yesif he is your husband . 
i &apos;ve been thinking about you . 
up yonder .  see the lights ? 
mr .  gordon
if it &apos;s on the level . 
who &apos;s she gonna marry ? 
i met her on a bus coming from miami .  been with her every minute .   i &apos;m in love with her ,  joe . 
wouldn &apos;t have made a bad story ,  would it ? 
yeah ,  where am i ? 
they made me get  &apos;em a rope and a blanket ,  on a night like this . 
what do you reckon that &apos;s for ? 
send it collect . 
not a minute ! 
william walter ,  the night clerk on duty here in the fbi office ,  gave me a copy of this .   it went all over the country .   nothing was done ,  and the motorcade went ahead on schedule  -  and this wasn &apos;t even mentioned in the warren report !   read it ,  al . 
gentlemen ,  i will not hear this .   i value bill as much as anyone here .   we all need to make room for someone else &apos;s ideas ,  lou ,  especially me .  maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and i &apos;m just plain dumb wrong . 
there you go .   grain of salt .   two sides to every coin . 
street cats ? 
did he pay ? 
did you speak to oswald in dallas ? 
a bullshit president !   i don &apos;t see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs .  where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedy &apos;s communist buddies  -  all these damned peace treaties !  i &apos;m telling ya jack ,  that &apos;s what happens when you let the niggers vote .   they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart . 
who the hell opened my files !   you &apos;ve been looking through my private files ,  haven &apos;t you ,  you weasel ? 
or a cover up !   jesus ,  bill ,  don &apos;t you have enough proof of the fbi &apos;s complicity now ? 
correct me if i &apos;m wrong .   i thought we were on the same side .   what the hell business is it of theirs to say that ? 
clay bertrand ?   sure i know him .   he comes around the quarter . 
did he pay you for this ? 
can you get some sworn statements ? 
shaw &apos;s our toehold ,  bill .   i don &apos;t know exactly what he is ,  where he fits ,  and i don &apos;t care .   i do know he &apos;s lying through his teeth and i &apos;m not gonna let go of him ! 
with a full - blown conspiracy to cover it up ?   y &apos;ever read your shakespeare ,  bill ? 
it leads farther than that . 
the fontainbleau ?   20 minutes ? 
i &apos;m caught in the middle .   they &apos;re after me .   it &apos;s almost over . 
come in ,  dave .   have a seat ,  make yourself comfortable .   coffee ? 
no .  .  .  if he did ,  i don &apos;t remember him .   there were lots of kids in and out .  .  .  y &apos;know . 
who was paying you ,  dave ? 
was it the same oswald ,  dave ,  that was in dallas ,  or was it an impersonator . 
they &apos;ll get to you ,  too  -  they &apos;ll destroy you .  .  .  they &apos;re untouchable ,  man .  .  .   i &apos;m so fucking exhausted i can &apos;t see straight . 
that &apos;s our case ! 
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet . 
 .  .  . which is strange  &apos;cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination . 
none either .   it &apos;s bizarre .   it &apos;s next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out .   nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in  &apos;63 .   a man who has defected once already .   it &apos;s crazy . 
 .  .  . now it gets positively spooky .  in january ,  1961  -  in new orleans ,  at the bolton ford dealership  -  when the oswald we know is in russia  -  there is a man using the name  &quot; oswald &quot;  to buy trucks for the friends of democratic cuba .   the salesman never saw him again ,  but guess who &apos;s on the articles of incorporation of the friends of democratic cuba ?   guy banister .   banister has someone using the name  &quot; oswald &quot;  to buy the trucks .   hoover ,  at the fbi ,  writes a memo dated june ,  1960 ,  that there could be someone using oswald &apos;s passport and identity . 
i don &apos;t believe it ! 
no .   never heard of him . 
no ,  i don &apos;t believe i know anyone by that name . 
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory .  mr .  o &apos;keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter  -  a colored man .   he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other  -  which he found rather unusual because the table was so long .   does that bring back memories of willie o &apos;keefe ? 
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you . 
no ,  it was not .   do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews ? 
mr .  shaw ,  this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy ,  that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal political - espionage activities .   it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities . 
in the sheriff &apos;s report ,  mrs .  mercer ,  it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that .  .  . 
jim ,  what is going on ,  for heaven &apos;s sake !   you going to stay up all night every night ?   for what ?   so you &apos;ll be the only man in america who read the entire 26 volumes of the warren report ? 
i promise i &apos;ll make more time for jasper . 
of course ,  i &apos;ve changed !   my eyes have opened ,  and once they &apos;re open ,  believe me ,  what used to look normal seems insane !   and now king .   don &apos;t you think this has something to do with that ?   can &apos;t you see ? 
anything else unusual about him you &apos;d be able to describe in a court of law ,  willie ? 
what &apos;s wrong ,  lou ? 
oh no !  .  .  .  how bad ? 
the office of naval intelligence . 
graveyard dead .   august this year .   a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian ,  texas .   the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died .  
that means we gotta subpoena time -  life on it . 
are you giving me an ultimatum ,  lou ? 
just speculating ,  i guess .   how do you think it started ? 
he &apos;s done it before .   other countries .  lumumba in the congo ,  trujillo ,  the dominican republic ,  he &apos;s working on castro .   no big deal .   in september ,  kennedy announces the texas trip .  at that moment ,  second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket .   y flies in the assassins ,  maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens ,  greece  -  pros ,  maybe some locals ,  cubans ,  maria hire ,  separate teams .   does it really matter who shot from what rooftop ?   part of the scenery .   the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone .  .  . 
anyone else involved at banister &apos;s level ? 
sure .    &apos;course they hated the sonofabitch ,  but .  .  . 
never .   not with me sir ,  never .  .  .  listen ,  i think i &apos;d better go .   i said enough .   i said all i &apos;m going to say .  
stop your investigation .  .  .  it was a magnificent effort but it &apos;s over and done with .   the press is already on your behind and that &apos;s only the beginning ,  my boy ,  only the beginning . 
virginia or elizabeth ? 
tomorrow i &apos;ll talk to your probation officer .  karen &apos;s a good kid ,  but she &apos;s mad at you ,  because you lied to her .  this business about your grandmother &apos;s funeral
i don &apos;t know .  maybe it &apos;s a language problem .   anita ,  you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided ,  i &apos;ll never write you again .  you understand ? 
won &apos;t forget ? 
what the fuck can i say ?  i &apos;m serious ,  man .  what the fuck can i say ?  thank you .  .  .  thank you .  .  .  thank you . 
you were there for me . 
that requires me goin &apos; out tonight ? 
aaaaawww man ,  i wasn &apos;t plannin &apos; on goin &apos; no place .  it &apos;s twelve o &apos;clock ,  man .  i &apos;m home ,  i &apos;m high  -  - 
you got a good lawyer ? 
what &apos;s she willing to give us ? 
can i have a word with you ? 
 &apos;cause i look like i just got outta jail ,  that &apos;s why .  you droppin &apos; me off at home ,  right ?  there &apos;s a place by me . 
what have they told you ? 
same as you .  ten thousand . 
no ,  you didn &apos;t .  what branch ? 
i want to talk to them first .  i know more now about ordell &apos;s money . 
fifteen thousand . 
i walked right past you . 
why ? 
you don &apos;t actually do it that way ? 
make the delivery somewhere in the mall . 
i see . 
you know where it came from .  it &apos;s not like it &apos;s anybody &apos;s life savings .  it wouldn &apos;t even be missed . 
got another gun and a stun gun .  .  . 
if you had a chance ,  unemployed now ,  to walk off with a half - million dollars ,  would you take it ? 
don &apos;t even think about it .  you could get yourself killed go to prison .  .  . 
oh ,  yeah .  i got them thinking ordell &apos;s real nervous .  they love thinking he &apos;s scared of them . 
where &apos;s the rest of it ? 
how &apos;d you find out ? 
it never was ,  so i &apos;m not gonna start worrying about it now .  look ,  ray more or less believes my story ,  and he more or less doesn &apos;t care .  all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell . 
i got your package .  it was fun getting a half - a - million dollars in the mail . 
madrid or barcelona ? 
then how do you know he sells guns ? 
uh - huh . 
you took the time to pay the saleswoman . 
we pick up ordell .  we &apos;ve got three murders we can link him to .  we have the storage unit where he keeps his guns ,  by tomorrow we &apos;ll have a search warrant to go in and get him .  and we have you . 
what &apos;s that fucker ever done for us ? 
for what ? 
this fella beaumont ,  they say what happened to him ? 
i &apos;ll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it &apos;s on . 
the cockatoo inn . 
it &apos;s right on hawthorne boulevard and manhattan beach boulevard .  it &apos;s red brick .  .  . 
i bet you come here on a saturday night ,  you need nigga repellent keep  &apos;em off your ass . 
well ,  shit .  that don &apos;t mean you gotta confirm it ! 
if you just listen ,  you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a damn good idea .  the first time i do it they &apos;re lurking about .  they see me hand the ten thousand to someone . 
no ,  i give it to someone else first . 
that &apos;s the idea . 
who ? 
look ,  it &apos;s my ass facin &apos; the penitentiary .  you send some hard -  headed roc whore ,  and she fucks things up . 
it washes off .  i tell them we &apos;re doing it the same way as before .  they &apos;ll follow sheronda .  i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall . 
so you come out with her robinson &apos;s / may bag ,  go meet sheronda .  simone peeks out ,  waits for my man louis here to give her a signal nobody &apos;s watchin &apos; .  she leaves the store ,  gets in her car  -  -  mission accomplished . 
with ordell ? 
did you ever go i one ? 
well ,  so far he is .  but you have to admit he &apos;s not too bright . 
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying at all .   you know where he went ? 
we &apos;re leaving now ! 
that &apos;s a nice outfit on her .  i &apos;m gonna go over and look at this michi moon display . 
thanks ,  baby . 
take the keys ,  man .  listen to music . 
naw ,  man .  i just told you ,  i &apos;m comfortable .  i ain &apos;t about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable .  you bring your ass out here . 
who was that ? 
what &apos;s your relationship ? 
i still don &apos;t understand why you keep her around . 
i got it .  listen ,  there &apos;s something else i have to tell you . 
you couldn &apos;t just hit her ? 
so you &apos;re sure she &apos;s dead . 
louis ? 
so you light ,  ain &apos;t you .  you light about a half - a - million . 
what &apos;d you shoot her with ? 
if there were nothin; in here but towels ,  maybe she didn &apos;t get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a . t . f .  got it .  but ,  she put these fuckin &apos; books in here to trick our ass . 
you know who i saw in the dress department ? 
i didn &apos;t really think anything of it .  no  -  -  i did wonder what he was doing there ,  but didn &apos;t think it had anything to do with us .  you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend . 
i ain &apos;t givin &apos; you fuckin &apos; excuses ,  i &apos;m givin &apos; you reasons . 
is this ,  me and you ,  like a lawyer -  client relationship ?  the lawyer can &apos;t tell nothing he hears ? 
you still there ? 
jackie didn &apos;t trust melanie .  she &apos;d already tried to get jackie to go in with her ,  split the half million amongst themselves .  what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money . 
in a way ,  yes . 
she was afraid . 
if she wanted to set you up ,  you &apos;d be in custody right now .  when you said you &apos;d name her as an accessory she believed you .  that scares her more than anything . 
my money &apos;s in that office ,  right ? 
ha - ha - ha .  i &apos;m serious ,  you smoke too much of that shit .  that shit robs you of your ambition . 
he &apos;s around . 
well ,  how do i look ? 
something weird is going on here .  what is it about us ?  even in nam it was always weird .  are we all crazy or something ? 
what are you talking about ? 
wait  .  .  .  daddy . 
i am . 
i &apos;m too messed up to teach . 
he was scared .  he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork .  they were tryin &apos; to get him ,  he said . 
it &apos;s not worth goin &apos; over again and again .  whatever happened ,  happened .  it &apos;s over . 
loves me !  ?  she hasn &apos;t said a kind word about me in years ! 
from a slipped disc ?  that &apos;d be a first . 
what are you talking about ?  you can barely stand . 
ah .  neither snow nor sleet ,  nor dark of night  .  .  .  i always admired that . 
yes .   i don &apos;t want them .  i &apos;m not looking for analysis or drugs .  it &apos;s too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis .   it &apos;s more than that .  i can feel it .  i need you prof .  you &apos;re the only one i can talk to . 
i &apos;m sorry but there &apos;s no record of a jacob singer in our files . 
what was that ? 
it &apos;s not healthy with it closed . 
i don &apos;t know .  santa claus .  i had my son &apos;s picture in it .  gabe &apos;s picture .  it &apos;s the only one i had . 
i moved the couch .  that &apos;s all . 
you up ? 
where &apos;d you leave  &apos;em ? 
they &apos;re biblical .  they were prophets . 
you &apos;re a real heathen ,  you know that ,  jezzie ?  jesus ,  how did i ever get involved with such a ninny ? 
what &apos;s in here ? 
i &apos;m going home . 
it &apos;s still there ,  jake .   even if you never say a word about it .  you can &apos;t spend two years in vietnam  .  .  . 
new york is filled with creatures .  everywhere .  and lots of stations are closed . 
demons ,  jake ?  come on .  they &apos;re winos and bag ladies .  low life .  that &apos;s all they are .  the streets are crawling with  &apos;em .  don &apos;t make em into somethin &apos; they &apos;re not .   it &apos;s the pressure ,  honey .  that &apos;s all it is . 
oh ,  come on .  it &apos;s early . 
what do you mean ?  where do you think ? 
can &apos;t you stop it ? 
what are you talking about ?  i &apos;m freezing .

so first i &apos;m arrested ,  right ?  best lsd i ever made ,  right down the drain .  i figure this is it ,  twenty years in the joint ,  if i &apos;m lucky .  that was  &apos;68 . 
no shit .  they had me by the balls .  next thing i know i &apos;m in saigon  .  .  .  in a secret lab synthesizing mind -  altering drugs .  not the street stuff mind you .  they had us isolating special properties .  the dark side ,  you know ?  they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies . 
right .  they were worried .  they figured you guys were too soft .  they wanted something to stir you up ,  tap into your anger ,  you know ?  and we did it .  the most powerful thing i ever saw .  even a bad trip ,  and i had my share ,  never compared to the fury of the ladder . 
the truth can kill ,  my friend .  five hundred men died out there .  this isn &apos;t a story they &apos;d ever want out .  when paul &apos;s car blew up i realized the scope of the thing .  i knew they meant business . 
dream on ! 
i &apos;m sorry . 
pull the mirror down on the sun visor .   just watch  &apos;em . 
that &apos;s as straight as i can put it .  and don &apos;t tell me that i &apos;m crazy  &apos;cause i know i &apos;m not .  i &apos;m goin &apos; to hell .  they &apos;re comin &apos; after me .

he &apos;s busting the shaft !  start the pump ! 
he can &apos;t stay down with three barrels on him !  where is he ?  ! 
why not ,  larry ?  we could get a positive confirmation that way . 
we have got to close the beaches .  we have got to get someone to kill the shark ,  we need non - corrosive mesh netting ,  we need scientific support .  .  .  it &apos;s gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have . 
you &apos;d love to prove that .  getting your name in the national geographic . 
officer ,  i wonder if you could tell me where i could find chief brody ? 
drowning .  lemme ask you something .  is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water ,  around 10 feet from the beach ? 
something else .  do most attacks go unreported ? 
 .  .  . and it was dartmouth winter weekend ,  and she was homecoming queen ,  and i was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family ,  and she was right  -  -  her great - grandfather was in mining ,  and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders .  so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence . 
can you tell from that if a big man -  eater is around ?

well ,  yeah .  you &apos;re the best friend i &apos;ve ever had ,  even when you &apos;re being kind of evil . 
can we make out now ? 
hey man . 
they could be utterly negligent .  maybe they &apos;ll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would .  have you considered that ? 
did you see it coming when she sat us down here ? 
shit .   hey ,  can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already ? 
this is our attorney ,  gerta rauss . 
your guitar is named kimber ?

damn skippy ,  you &apos;re not !  you don &apos;t even remember to give liberty bell her breathing meds . 
hi dad . 
yeah ,  like people in love .

maybe you &apos;re having twins .  maybe your little boyfriend &apos;s got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice ! 
but then you &apos;ll get huge .  your chest is going to milktate .  and you have to tell everyone you &apos;re pregnant . 
maybe they &apos;ll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break . 
oh yeah !   &quot; desperately seeking spawn .  &quot;  they &apos;re right by the ads for like ,  iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment .  it &apos;s totally legit . 
what did you have in mind ,  a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest ? 
best to just tell them ,  man .  rip off the band - aid and let it bleed . 
well ,  i wanted to pick something gender - neutral for now .  once we get the baby ,  god willing ,  we can create a more decisive palette . 
what ? 
what would be a good time for you ? 
a hotel ? 
i told you how early feels  &apos;bout a woman drinking . 
adele .  .  .  are you serious ? 
my momma &apos;s a beautician .  guess that &apos;s where i get it from .  she wouldn &apos;t hear of my moving in with early .  .  .  on account of his just getting out of jail and all .  ain &apos;t seen her in nearly a year now .  i wish she &apos;d call me ,  just once .

he &apos;s a killer ,  brian .  .  .  he &apos;s fucking insane . 
you were plenty hot . 
have you ever had anal intercourse ? 
well ,  girl .  you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections . 
you &apos;re clean . 
i &apos;m telling you casper .  i think i &apos;m getting addicted to that shit . 
i mean i &apos;m dreaming about going all out ,  crazy shit . 
probably . 
yeah .   &quot; the wonder twins &quot;  .  you know .   activate in the form of ,  a glass of water . 
and it got me thinkin &apos; .  how fun it would be to share each other &apos;s girl . 
but that &apos;s the thing .  girl &apos;s like it slow .  they like romance .  they like things to be sweet and romantic . 
man ,  this guy is really good . 
yeah .  i like her .  i &apos;ve wanted to get with her for a while now . 
whenever you see someone who &apos;s really messed up ,  especially amputees and retards .  you give them money .  but if it &apos;s just a regular bum ,  you pass them by . 
so really ,  it &apos;s good luck . 
yo ,  you got any weed around here ? 
casper . 
where you at ? 
i &apos;m goin &apos; .  you on the list ? 
yeah watch the fuck where you skate .  you know what i &apos;m saying ? 
ooh .  you &apos;re gonna give me goose bumps . 
you know i &apos;ve been thinking about you lately . 
do you like kissing me ? 
i &apos;m nervous . 
i like you so much .  i think you &apos;re beautiful .  i think if we fucked you would love it .  you wouldn &apos;t believe it . 
i just know .  i know you &apos;ll love it . 
i don &apos;t want you to hurt you .  i &apos;ll be gentle . 
jennie ,  jennie .  how do you feel ? 
what is it ? 
the test isn &apos;t one hundred percent accurate .  you should .  .  . 
yeah . 
no ,  not everything ?  the sun is still shinning .  it &apos;s a beautiful day out .  some things are ok .  right ? 
yeah .  i &apos;m not saying you should get a tattoo .  but you should make yourself happy . 
hell yeah .  i love .  i love sex . 
yep ,  yep .  but he has to know what he &apos;s doing and where he &apos;s going .  because they can like touch you for hours and they won &apos;t ever know . 
diss digg ,  diss digg ,  diss digg . 
its like .  but it gets boring .  it &apos;s boring . 
oh shit . 
i made her get tested with me because i didn &apos;t want to go alone . 
how can you hang out with casper ?  he &apos;s such a jerk . 
no .  i was just kidding . 
so ,  how many people live here now ? 
yeah . 
right . 
i can &apos;t man . 
it wasn &apos;t serious .   what &apos;s your problem ? 
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ? 
are you crazy ? 
what in the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?   slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace . 
you know ,  i figure that &apos;s pretty much how these girl &apos;s feel just before they get it .   you think i &apos;m right ? 
he &apos;s not talking about himself . 
debi rutlege .   female .   caucasian .  twenty four .   worked over at the four oaks hotel . 
the f . b . i .  has nothing remotely similar to this guy .   i think he &apos;s a first -  timer . 
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel . 
what is it ? 
remember eventually revenge is carefully .  .  .   have you tired juxtaposing the words ? 
someone who &apos;s going to become an important part of your life .   i want to play a game with you . 
i suppose you want to know where i &apos;m going to kill tonight ,  peter ? 
hello ? 
just for that no hint today . 
what makes you think i was there ? 
what word did you leave last night ? 
that wouldn &apos;t be very sporting .  remember huxley ?    &quot; his play is always fair and just .  &quot; 
computers .   that &apos;s how you got into homesearchers records .   you can get into anything .   but why ?   why ? 
would you mind keeping your voice down ?  i have guests . 
they asked who would be best suited for this and you -  - 
you don &apos;t want to believe it .   it &apos;s a normal reaction . 
is your dad here ? 
congratulations ,  dad . 
what are you doing up ? 
well ? 
you never know how you &apos;re going to catch a suspect . 
well ,  i think you have to play to his ego .   he thinks he &apos;s superior .   the more secure he feels ,  the more chances he &apos;ll take . 
we can &apos;t rely on your judgement anymore . 
excuse me .  .  .  you said earlier that mary albert just moved in .   how long ago was that ? 
i know you &apos;re busy so i &apos;ll get right to it .   did you know her ? 
could you tell me where you were last night ? 
mister sanderson ,  this is doctor sheppard .   she &apos;s a psychologist helping us out . 
what have you come up with on the riddle ? 
maybe ,  but i don &apos;t think so .   i think it &apos;s just a tease . 
that &apos;s it ? 
where were you last night ? 
jeremy would have never killed himself . 
what do you see here ? 
yes ,  doctor sheppard .   we called you back but you weren &apos;t home .   we have the book . 
of course .   yes ,  here it is .   why ,  they &apos;re all the same ? 
i &apos;ve always wanted to learn how to play chess .   i don &apos;t have the patience for it .   when did you start playing ? 
are you disappointed that i won &apos;t answer you ? 
what are you looking for ? 
i tried again and got through . 
in a fierce magazine you &apos;ll find a hint of my actions to come .  .  .  why does he set this line apart ? 
a fierce magazine .  .  .  brutal .  .  .   an angry magazine .  .  .  a war magazine .  .  .  a mercenary magazine .  .  .   fierce .  .  .   mad . 
hi . 
the other night  -  -  i said some things that maybe i shouldn &apos;t have .   i mean ,  you haven &apos;t known me very long and i can see how you thought what you did . 
that &apos;s still no excuse .   you treat everything like a game . 
this isn &apos;t going to be like the phone book ,  is it ? 
you beat him . 
we &apos;re almost married . 
there .  now you look like someone i might want to marry . 
take the western passage . 
the white castle has fallen . 
the new queen lives . 
traitor !  she &apos;ll marry you in hell ! 
it is today ? 
each to his fate . 
you too are lonely . 
let me comfort you . 
help !  help !  i &apos;m drowning ! 
once is enough ,  thank you . 
your kingship  .  .  .  your lord high mightiness  .  .  .  when i called you a  .  .  .  a  .  .  .  whatever i called you ,  i didn &apos;t realize that you were  .  .  .  were  .  .  . 
my friend< / u> . 
try your tricks on me and i &apos;ll turn myself back into a snake and bite you . 
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll grow careless . 
fame is what you leave to your sons . 
and where do you lead ,  boy ? 
when did you last sleep ,  boy ? 
forgive me ,  my friends .  i saw terrible things . 
we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise . 
a good thrust ,  my friend .  another second and there &apos;d have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories . 
you ! 
what is that awful looking place ? 
where are you going ? 
what kind of a boy are you ?  boys always have candy . 
sir ergo ?   .  .  .  my honorable lord ergo ?   .  .  . 
what ?  now you poke me in the nose as well ? 
food for crows . 
passable ,  pimple ,  very passable . 
one with red eyes ,  the other with one eye ,  both trying to kill me . 
it &apos;s a lie ! 
he will come for me . 
a girl of some spirit ,  your daughter . 
modred !  impossible ! 
we seek the fortress of krull . 
the dark ones will appose you with all their power . 
she has the power of vision . 
i &apos;ll stay behind and keep them busy . 
go now .   quell was wise .  he knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends . 
who speaks that name ! 
she bore you many children ? 
you had left me !  i kept silent out of rage . 
could i lie to you and still see your beauty ? 
a young man seeks her .  a young man about the age i was when i met you . 
at a certain moment i thought :  maybe leon would like working on his own ?  so he makes some little extras ? 
tell me .  .  .  the money i earn and you keep for me .  .  . 
ok ,  i &apos;m fine . 
look .  when you can see his fingers ,  it &apos;s 50 meters .   when you just see his hands ,  it &apos;s about 80 meters .  when you distinguish arms from body ,  it &apos;s 120 - 130 .  when you see nothing more than a shape ,  you don &apos;t shoot .   not very sure .  you have one chance out of five to miss .   a contract means getting all chances on your side .  5 out of 5 .   you can &apos;t miss a client .  never .  .  .  if the task is delicate or the risk is too big ,  you double .  that is ,  you insure yourself by another means . 
the yellow and pink . 
if you knew ,  leon .  .  .  !   i killed one thousand in my head .  .  .   and this never disturbed my sleep . 
where are you going ? 
 .  .  . i &apos;d like knowing what he &apos;s listening to .  .  . 
why did you unleash the pipe ,  i don &apos;t know ? 
yes ? 
how are you ,  miss ? 
 .  .  . ok .  .  .  good . 
listen ,  son ,  you know as well as me this kind of hitmen :  they come from nowhere ,  get the contract and disappear .  they &apos;re lonely ,  worse than wolves . 
uncle maurice  -  -  i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here .  .  .  i have a rented car outside ,  just listen to me .   come back with me now ,  and if you still want to do something like this in a year  -  -  maybe we &apos;ll plan a car trip across the country  -  -  gerald and i will come along  -  - 
listen to me very carefully ,  because i don &apos;t want you to misunderstand me .  .  .  the walk is over uncle maurice .   done .  finished .   you &apos;ve made it to california ,  it was a miracle ,  now let &apos;s try to save your life . 
what would you like us to do ? 
this is indiana  -  -  nothing &apos;s going to happen to you . 
i know what you &apos;re getting at . 
is this going to be similar to the flower incident ? 
it isn &apos;t going to make it ellen .  let the poor thing go quietly . 
red flag ,  man . 
there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball ,  but he was too small and no one would let him play .  .  .  but he kept practicing by himself  -  -  waiting .  .  .  he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove . 
right .   but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed .  .  .  but not big billy .   he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game .   it came to the end of the game .   it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game .  .  . 
three thousand miles ?  .  .  .  how many times does twenty go into three thousand ? 
umm ,  he &apos;s going to make it isn &apos;t he ? 
phileas fogg ? 
you &apos;re walking to california ? 
pacifica ,  california .  .  .  that &apos;s a long ways away . 
tom joad ? 
i missed you kris . 
adelle told me ,  your writing is going well .   the crusader for social issues and all . 
i haven &apos;t been too punctual with the rent . 
come on mr .  parker . 
what do your friends call you ? 
where did he go ? 
no alcohol .  you gotta get something else .  everything &apos;s ten dollars .  what do you want ? 
are you working ? 
i sometimes fade out . 
want a drink ?  i &apos;m having one . 
i cashed in all of my money ,  paid my amex card ,  gonna sell the car tomorrow . 
i don &apos;t know .   i &apos;ll go and sort it out today .  why don &apos;t you come ?  .  .  .  we &apos;ll find a real room for me .  you can pick it out ,  a tower on the strip . 
me neither . 
you can never .  .  .  never .  .  .  ask me to stop drinking .  do you understand ? 
 .  .  . and i &apos;m not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life .  we know i &apos;m a drunk .  .  .  but that seems to be all right with you .  and i know that you &apos;re a hooker .  i hope you understand that i &apos;m a person who is totally at ease with this .  .  .  which is not to say that i &apos;m indifferent or that i don &apos;t care .  .  .  i do .  .  .  it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement .  what i &apos;m saying is .  .  .  that i hope you understand that i understand . 
well  -  -  i was prepared for worse ,  but it wasn &apos;t so bad .  we were sitting at the bar ,  talking about blackjack .  you seemed just fine ,  a little drunker than usual ,  but nothing really strange ,  but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then ,  wham ,  you swung you arm at me ,  and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress .  you smashed everything on her tray ,  it was a real mess .  you kept yelling and yelling . 
you were ok for a while ,  so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck ,  but i think even you knew that wasn &apos;t going to happen .  we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store ,  even though i told you that we had plenty at home .  in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change .  i asked you if you knew it was a hundred .  you said you did ,  so i let you do it .  we got here ,  you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed . 
here &apos;s my speech .  .  .    .  .  . i know this shouldn &apos;t be acceptable to me ,  but it is .  don &apos;t ask me why .  i sense that your trouble is very big .  .  .  and i &apos;m scared for you .  .  .  and so i &apos;m doing what i think you need me to do .  falling down in casinos is little stuff .  it doesn &apos;t bother me .  it has nothing to do with us . 
very creative .  now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers . 
i &apos;ve missed the best sun .  why did you have to pawn your watch ? 
will you lighten up ,  please ? 
what did they look like ? 
well .  .  .  i thought you might be looking for a date .

go ,  sera .   go .  stay at home .  i will call you tomorrow .

why would i kill my husband ? 
he thinks i &apos;m guilty ,  doesn &apos;t he ?

generally known !   what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots ?

a good day for singing .  .  . 
where &apos;s your joy if you cannot sing ? 
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it .   said she &apos;d marry me if i did . 
nay .   it was lost .   when i came up for air the pond was frozen over . 
you must find the ring .  .  .  it completes the cycle; answers the riddle .  .  . 
keep me belly full ,  jack .   kill us another worm . 
well done ,  lad .   stout heart . 
start acting like you &apos;re worthy of this mission .  .  .  here .   whatever you do ,  don &apos;t dare drop it .

and charmed ,  of course . 
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind . 
the fastest in the world . 
what do we do now ? 
each fit for a hero .  .  .  my uncle fashioned a hammer for thor .   twas he named it mjolnir .   grandfather forged excalibur .  .  .  you won &apos;t ever see finer craftsmanship . 
the avatar .   i like the sound of it . 
he &apos;s not there . 
so put your plans of my room in the trash . 
your dad dated my mom after her divorce . 
huh ? 
why are you so uptight ? 
not really . 
i don &apos;t wanna go . 
funny how he &apos;s the architect and you &apos;re just a loud mouth cop . 
mr .  stevens ? 
i &apos;m good ,  thanks . 
right .  .  . she married .  .  . what was he ? 
peter webber !   right .   quite the spotlight on that guy . 
well ,  i feel better about this now . 
i &apos;ve got one favor to ask . 
oh .  .  . do you know when she &apos;ll be home ? 
if she &apos;s not up ,  you can use my shower . 
it bugs me . 
where are you going ? 
i was holding for someone .   that wasn &apos;t even mine . 
hi ,  alyssa . 
that &apos;s not true . 
i don &apos;t know what that means .   what kind of problem ? 
i still don &apos;t know what that means . 
no .   a friend .  .  .  your mother ?   everybody gets touched by someone they love . 
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty . 
ah !   oh .  .  .  . 
mr .  dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house . 
why do you let your dog crap on his lawn ,  day after day ? 
how many bedrooms will your house have ? 
i just wanted to know where mom was ? 
i love those doors . 
i drove over and you were gone . 
no .   i was going to let you do that . 
i used to live here . 
i was here six years .   and i only hated two . 
it &apos;s not breakfast yet . 
i &apos;ve been wrong a lot in my life . 
where &apos;s sam ? 
i &apos;ll find something that won &apos;t kill them . 
i know they &apos;re not much help ,  but they love coming here ,  george . 
when i picked you up from the train station .  .  . what you said . 
it sounded like a pick - up line . 
don &apos;t move ! 
i better get the kids home . 
been thinking ? 
it &apos;ll take you like twenty ,  thirty minutes . 
i don &apos;t have a clue anymore .   i wish you &apos;d talk to him .   he needs a man . 
we &apos;ve eaten . 
that sounds pathetic ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
you got a dog ? 
do you know anything about building a house ? 
queer . 
they ain &apos;t men ,  mae rose .  they &apos;re convicts .  and nigger convicts to boot .  can you say nigger ? 
she &apos;ll be fine .  she just had a bit of a shock . 
you probably mean can &apos;t get right .  that &apos;s him over there . 
no ,  but .  .  . 
do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door . 
damn dentures slipping again .  everything falls apart when you grow old ,  eh ,  claude ?  time sure marches on . 
i apologize ,  claude .  that was rude of me . 
where they taking us ,  anyway ? 
ah ,  go chase yourself .  i &apos;ll take my business elsewhere .  and for future reference ,  you are no longer welcome at ray &apos;s boom - boom room . 
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  maybe because our lives depend on it ,  i just sort of thought you knew what you were doing ! 
life ?  !  how long is life ?  we were just walking back to the truck .  we didn &apos;t do nothing !  fuck life ! 
what a second ,  you &apos;ve been in here since you were thirteen ? 
what i know about boats is they take you to freedom .  come on ,  man .  i think we can do this . 
what does that mean ? 
sure is hot today .  think it &apos;ll rain later ? 
your daddy must have been a helluva guy ,  a deep man ,  a wise man .  sure wish i could have met him  -  - 
no . 
i know people . 
you get ketchup ? 
it &apos;s amazing what ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses . 
let it go ,  claude . 
i don &apos;t see you coming up with any plans . 
take that back or we ain &apos;t friends no more ,  claude banks . 
hey ,  i &apos;m a lonely old man .  i like to talk ,  too .  so why don &apos;t we start by talking about what kind of a plan you &apos;re working on ? 
what &apos;d you say ? 
nurse humphries was checking my prostate this morning .  i got an erection . 
don &apos;t tell me ,  i don &apos;t want to hear it .  it &apos;s probably all fucked up ,  anyway . 
it &apos;s too late for plans . 
if you don &apos;t eat that ice cream right now ,  i &apos;m gonna strangle you until you are completely dead . 
how about some steak sauce ? 
he &apos;s from new york city .  that one ,  too . 
i can &apos;t believe this .  i always said i &apos;d never end up like this .  i thought i &apos;d make something of myself ,  do something with my life .  you know ,  be successful .  have a big house ,  a family .  now i &apos;m gonna end up just like daddy . 
you can &apos;t go in there ,  ray !  you &apos;ll never make it ! 
hey ,  ray ,  you ever been to the cotton club ? 
hey ,  ray ,  what &apos;s the name of that nightclub of yours ? 
what &apos;s that ,  some of your bathtub brew ? 
adrian ! 
adrian ,  you gotta come back to hell .  dad &apos;s sick . 
little nicky . 
now will you get in the flask ? 
i knew it .  he &apos;s finally retiring . 
ta - da .  so what time is my brother expected back ? 
keep it up and i just might make you my queen for a night or two . 
oh .  my .  god .  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here .  welcome .  can i just tell you ,  i am so excited right now . 
i remember that night ,  you had like four daiquiris . 
did you just talk ? 
you &apos;re on earth now ,  kid .  gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has .  we &apos;ll stop by k - mart .  get you some warm clothes . 
from now on .  i &apos;m just going to avoid all moving metal objects . 
your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil . 
you can &apos;t do jack shit .  .  .  unless you learn your evil powers . 
i was with valerie ,  i swear .  this is adrian &apos;s work .  i &apos;ve got to find him . 
this is baloney ! 
can i take him with me and have sex with his head ? 
i got no ears !  i can &apos;t hear ! 
i mean .  .  .  tough break . 
nicky ,  the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed ,  in which case ,  boom ,  you end up back here . 
uh ,  i &apos;ll do my best ,  dad .  do you have any advice at all for me ? 
thanks . 
you know ,  i was the one who created hell . 
you know what was in hell when i came down here ,  cassius ? 
nothing .  no mountains .  no castles .  looked like a giant parking lot .  it wasn &apos;t even called hell . 
hey .  .  . 
no wonder your uncle &apos;s so weird .  .  . 
you sure you &apos;re down with this ? 
which way did he go ? 
it &apos;s  &quot; comptoir sud pacific .  &quot;  makes me feel like a hula girl .  which is kinda what i &apos;m going for .  wanna come in ? 
valerie doran ?  two floors up ,  one window over . 
adrian ? 
the south . 
want to ?  a million angry octopus people couldn &apos;t hold me back ! 
it &apos;s freezing my hands . 
what were you thinking coming here ? 
nicky ! 
hello ,  friend ,  my name is nicky .  i understand you &apos;re seeking a roommate ,  as per your advertisement in the village voice .  would it be possible for me to fill the slot ? 
yes .  what is rent ? 
off limits . 
it looks like the work of a brother .  .  . 
answer the question ! 
what other food ? 
do you have anything special in mind ? 
i just might look in on new you 483 myself . 
why did you do that ?  ?  !  ! 
what &apos;s wrong ,  available ? 
yes .  .  .  probably he was renewed ? 
i never  &apos;killed &apos; anybody in my life .  sandmen terminate runners .   who brought you ? 
you felt sad .  what &apos;s your name ? 
i &apos;m not armed .   well ? 
why tell me ? 
where did you get that ? 
yes ,  but they won &apos;t know that .  .  .  or care .  they &apos;re hunting you ,  logan .  maybe me too ,  now .  .  . 
i hate outside !  i hate it ! 
it &apos;s getting dark and cold .  i &apos;m tired . 
maybe we &apos;re the first ones to get through .  .  .   maybe sanctuary is near ,  now .  .  .  another protected place .  it couldn &apos;t be outside . 
you &apos;re right .  .  .  it must be near now .  we &apos;ll find it . 
look at his face .  .  .  and his hair .  .  .   is that what it is to grow old ? 
there has to be !  i know it exists !  it has to !  ! 
things change ! 
what kind of jewel is this ? 
i &apos;ll make the arrangements . 
come with us . 
i like your face .  would you mind if doc took a picture ?  i &apos;d like him to give your face to somebody else . 
but there may be a few around somewhere . 
where are they ? 
it isn &apos;t fair .  i &apos;ll give you one of my favorite cats .  .  .  a jellicle cat .    &quot; jellicle cats have cheerful faces ,  jellicle cats have bright black eyes; they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise .  &quot; 
i know .  .  .   we &apos;re going to try and get in this way .  i don &apos;t think you can make it . 
this rod is a fuckin &apos; ,  embarrassment ,  carl .  whatiya burn in this thing ,   &quot; v &quot;  ? 
do you always sleep here ?  .  .  .  in this room ?  .  .  .  both of you ? 
why not ? 
what &apos;s that ,  ed ? 
okay .  .  . 
sure . 
have you partied with him ? 
what &apos;s he do ? 
how &apos;d you get in with these fuckin &apos; people ? 
how &apos;d it happen ,  alice ? 
you all right ? 
mr .  smith has been waiting for you and mrs .  trueworthy .  can you take care of mr .  smith now ? 
okay .  thanks . 
we &apos;re not saying anything about that night to the police .  we should all forget that night . 
have you made any charges against him ? 
i wouldn &apos;t know how . 
what did you say ? 
you don &apos;t mind that i &apos;m not coming tonight ? 
when you didn &apos;t come to the club . 
i had a dream about you last night .  .  . 
what was that ?  !  !  ! 
it was a long time ago .  .  .  i met him at this place called moke &apos;s .  .  .  we .  .  .  became friends .  .  .  he told me about a job .  .  . 
the heart ,  i guess . 
i want you to ride with me .  somethin &apos; doesn &apos;t sound right . 
beautiful !  smooth as shit from a duck &apos;s ass .  let &apos;s take a ride . 
thanks ,  mr .  eddy . 
i &apos;m leavin &apos; the caddy ,  like i told you .  think you &apos;ll get a chance to give her a once over today ? 
if you think you can finish it ,  i &apos;ll be back later today . 
okay . 
i don &apos;t think so .  where was it that you think we &apos;ve met ? 
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ? 
what do you mean ?  .  .  .  you &apos;ve been acting strange lately .  .  .  like the other night . 
i didn &apos;t know you cared . 
sorry . 
wait a minute ,  you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone ? 
yes ,  it just shows  i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m talking to you .  i don &apos;t know you .  who are you ? 
good morning ,  lovey . 
wait a minute .  is it a good morning ?  say ,  we &apos;re supposed to be traveling east ,  aren &apos;t we ? 
left us here to rot .  that &apos;s what they &apos;ve done .  heroes of the newspapers ! 
yeah ?  if this be execution ,  lead me to it . 
and this trip to the valley .  i can &apos;t imagine why i &apos;d allow you to drag me down here .  why ,  we don &apos;t know anything about these people .  we &apos;re not even armed ! 
well ,  that &apos;s that ,  i guess . 
you see ?  you get the idea ?  from this reservoir here i can pipe in the whole works .  oh ,  i &apos;m going to get a great kick out of this .  of course it &apos;s just to keep my hand in ,  but with the equipment we have here ,  i can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there .  can rig it up in no time .   do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water ? 
hey ,  what &apos;s happened to you ? 
if you want me to ! 
there you are !  barnard ,  you &apos;d better get your things together .  we &apos;re leaving . 
yes .  i &apos;ve just been talking with the porters .  they &apos;re going to take us .  we &apos;ve got clothing ,  food ,  everything .  come on ! 
right this very minute !   the porters are waiting for us on the plateau .  and that chinaman thought he could stop me .  come along . 
you mean you don &apos;t want to go ? 
for a man who talks a great deal ,  it &apos;s amazing how unenlightening you can be . 
by the way ,  what religion do you follow here ? 
to put it simply ,  i should say that our general belief was in moderation .  we preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind ,  even including  the excess of virtue itself . 
when was all this ? 
he amputated his own leg ? 
i surprise you ?  now that &apos;s news . 
and he can arrange for the porters to take us back ? 
charming ,  isn &apos;t she ? 
of course ,  the porters will be very well paid  -  that is ,  within reason . 
no porters here !  ! 
what exactly do you mean by  &quot; almost any time now &quot;  ? 
oh ,  thank you .  thank you ! 
in that event ,  we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately .  some means to get us back to civilization . 
sondra bizet . 
i have waited for you ,  my son ,  for a long time .  i have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers .  i have looked into their eyes and heard their voices  -  always in hope that i might find you  .  my friend ,  it is not an arduous task that i bequeath ,  for our order knows only silken bonds .  to be gentle and patient ,  to care for the riches of the mind ,  to preside in wisdom ,  while the storm rages without . 
and be sure that none of the natives get in . 
hurray for us .  did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated ?  no ,  you wouldn &apos;t say that .  they don &apos;t count . 
what are these people ? 
what &apos;s it mean ? 
we &apos;ve had plenty of it the last few days . 
well  -  i mean
george ,  i &apos;ve been putting things together .  do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot ?  and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane ?  chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point .  what brought them there ?  unless it was to meet us ? 
for heaven &apos;s sake ,  bob ,  what &apos;s the matter with you ?  you went out there for the purpose of
it &apos;s no place for you ,  bob .  think of what &apos;s waiting for you .  do you want to stay here until you &apos;re half dead ?  until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them ? 
i &apos;d go mad ! 
george ,  are you sure of the porters ?  about their taking care of you ,  i mean ? 
what &apos;s she got to do with it ? 
because you can &apos;t .  do you know what will happen to her if she leaves shangri - la ?  she &apos;s a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved .  take her out of this valley and she &apos;ll fade away like an echo . 
imagine having all that fuel there ,  waiting for us !   george ,  something tells me our journey is just beginning . 
at the mercy of a mad pilot . 
you know ,  each time i see you ,  i hear that music .  what is it ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i thought i was to be the light .  but why do i confuse you ?  am i so strange ? 
it &apos;s not so bad ,  really .  some phases are a little sordid ,  of course .  that &apos;s only to be expected . 
oh ,  the usual reasons .  a world full of people struggling for existence . 
well ,  everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself ,  accumulate a nest egg ,  and so on . 
that &apos;s what i mean  -  mysterious .  mr .  conway ,  i don &apos;t like that man .  he &apos;s too vague . 
i don &apos;t care what you &apos;ve got started .  do you want to go ? 
excuse me
i &apos;ll make some for you !   you will come today ? 
thank you . 
the hell happened ? 
so .  .  .  this door .   it &apos;s .  .  .  not an exit .  .  .    ? 
kids &apos; game a couple galaxies over . 
they don &apos;t ? 
sir .   i thought those records were sealed . 
sorry ,  cowan ,  i found out literally just before the ceremony .  &apos; apparently you &apos;re to report for further review . 
cowan .   do you ever think that maybe ,  just maybe ,  other people might be right and you might be wrong ? 
mikey .   hold it ,  mikey -  -  i want you to talk to me .   mikey .   i &apos;m telling you .  .  don &apos;t make me .  .  .  mikey   gimme the 140 . 
kay ,  listen ,  i dunno what got into -  - 
grab the coffee ,  will ya ?   i told zed i &apos;d give him a buzz . 
vayanse .  you others ,  go on . 
this is a neurelyser .  it was a gift from some friends from out of town .  i need you to look at it .   this red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain .   more specifically ,  the ones  - for memory ,  which it will then block .    i said i need you to look right here . 
i think she &apos;s the alien .   in any case ,  she &apos;s clearly spent my too much time alone in this room . 
i think you &apos;re too used to it .   if you ask me ,  you &apos;ve been doing this job too long . 
what &apos;d you do before this ,  anyway ?  wait -  -  let me guess .  ice sculpture ?  rock ? 
why ?   well ,  it wouldn &apos;t hurt you to have a little more fun .   i know i don &apos;t know you all that well ,  but -  - 
uh .  .  .  you mean .  .  .  a family of sixeyed ,  red - faced space creatures travelling to new mexico to have dinner with their cousins ,  the invertebrates ?   seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me . 
the radio show ? 
jesus .  .  . 
great .   fine .   listen ,  why don &apos;t we call the pentagon ,  maybe they &apos;ll take you back with the new age well wishers .   i &apos;ll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs . 
it &apos;s marble . 
would you call this a code 100 ? 
yeah .   his dream and our worst nightmare . 
what the hell does that mean ? 
yeah  .  .  .   ? 
let &apos;s go ,  jeebs .   downtown . 
er .  well ,  nowhere special . 
we &apos;re with the immigration and naturalization service ,  intergalactic bureau .   we monitor all - alien activity in and around earth and its enveloping atmosphere . 
we need to talk to you about the alien . 
really nice wheels ,  by the way . 
as far as i can tell ,  the guy &apos;s what he says he is  -  alone ,  and unarmed .   all he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public . 
how &apos;d you know ? 
take it . 
can &apos;t you see ?   she just wanted her little girl back . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  john ,  but you have to run again . 
about who ? 
that &apos;s not much . 
that &apos;s right .   it &apos;s a combined data stream based on all three previsions . 
why &apos;s he still a john doe ?   why wasn &apos;t he ever id &apos;s from an eyescan ? 
you understand ,  john ,  that the minute precrime goes national ,  they &apos;re going to take it away from us . 
just so you know ,  i &apos;ve overridden the vehicle locator .   i just wanted to talk to you before justice  -  - 
somebody named leo crow . 
i have no idea .   i &apos;ve never heard of him .   but i &apos;m supposed to kill him in less than thirty - six hours . 
the mall ? 
go ahead . 
what ? 
the fact that you prevented it from happening doesn &apos;t change the fact that it was going to happen . 
it was iris hineman .   she developed the precogs ,  designed the system and pioneered the interface . 
to them . 
so i &apos;ll be the first one to go in then ? 
sorry .   old habit .   i spent three years at fuller seminary before i became a cop .   my father was a minister .   lutheran . 
are these all of her previsions ? 
just go to the beginning ! 
okay .  .  .  now let me time you . 
i forgive you .  .  . 
look ,  i &apos;ve put my family through enough misery .   you gotta kill me !  this way i can leave  &apos;em something . 
look ,  believe me ,  i know it &apos;s hard ,  but you gotta do it  -  - 
something wrong ? 
yes ,  i &apos;m afraid that would be from the doll &apos;s eye . 
so many of them .  .  .  despite what we did for them .   or maybe because of what we did to them .   it doesn &apos;t matter .   it &apos;s a perfect system now ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
and ,  yet ,  a chain of events has started .   a chain that will lead inexorably to his death . 
answer my question .   did lamar burgess know about the minority report ? 
why should i trust you ? 
how do i even know which one has it ? 
who ? 
i understand . 
sir ,  the press conference is starting . 
how did you get this ? 
now the second image .   watch the water .   the wind &apos;s changed .   the ripples are going the other way . 
i did find it .   it was inside of agatha all this time .   so the question is ,  why would someone want this erased from the data file ? 
by fooling the system .   all someone would have to do is wait for precrime to stop the murder from taking place ,  then ,  a few minutes later ,  commit the crime in exactly the same way . 
uh ,  yeah ,  being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices .  .  . 
crime of passion .   no premeditation .   they show up late .  most of our scrambles are flash events like this one .   we rarely see anything with premeditation anymore . 
because of the nature of murder .    &quot; there &apos;s nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another &quot;  . 
don &apos;t worry .   i &apos;ll bring him in unharmed . 
it doesn &apos;t matter .   he wins . 
raincheck ? 
my name is danny witwer .   i &apos;m  -  - 
since right after we lost our son . 
you know i need to use you . 
nice to meet you ,  wally . 
wally ,  the other two can still function ,  right ? 
yeah . 
you sure ?  i just made it . 
 .  .  . and here is the key to the mini -  bar .  room and tax has been picked up by cardiff giant ,  as well as one fifty in incidentals . 
thank you very much ,  sir . 
i know . 
oh no .  what is it this time .

our minds ? 
but i &apos;m married . 
and absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband .  do we have that in common ,  captain ? 
i don &apos;t make the distinction .  but the sex urge is a powerful force .  in women just as much as men . 
how would he avoid it .  .  .  as if i needed to ask ? 
you &apos;re asking for somebody else ? 
you please excuse .  .  .   i have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army . 
he &apos;s the pro from dover and i &apos;m the ghost of smokey joe . 
the real trapper john ?  the one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the boston and maine railroad ? 
why can &apos;t you look at him ? 
but it &apos;s all over now ,  and i can &apos;t face it .  imagine if you found out you were one ,  you wouldn &apos;t like breaking the news to your wife .  well ,  i got the same problem multiplied .

good morning ,  colonel . 
those two big guys were tackles on the cleveland browns ,  and the redhead played halfback with the rams .

this one goes right to the or .  tell duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen .   and this kid can &apos;t wait .  i &apos;ll take him myself ,  before i get to that ruptured diaphragm . 
okay ,  i &apos;m closing up .  everybody relax . 
ease off on those tapes ,  and let &apos;s see how much it bleeds .   how is he ? 
as long as there &apos;s a pile - up ,  we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest . 
did you get it ,  too ? 
don &apos;t mind the colonel .  he hates people . 
never mind those guys .  all right ,  stand up .  now let &apos;s see what you look like when you protest . 
yes ! 
now ,  look ,  john .  here &apos;s the speech .  it &apos;s in caps and double - spaced .  you won &apos;t have any trouble reading it .  not nervous ,  are you ? 
oh .  yeah . 
look ,  john .  something terribly important &apos;s happened .  they &apos;re forming john doe clubs .  we know of eight already and they say that there &apos;s going
uh - huh .  to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech . 
oh ,  it started as a circulation stunt ,  but it isn &apos;t any more .  mr .  norton wants to get back of it and sponsor john doe clubs all over the country .  he wants to send you on a lecture tour . 
did you write this ? 
go ahead ,  driver !  ball park ! 
tomorrow night ,  before a crowd of fifteen thousand people ,  and talking over a nation - wide radio hook - up ,  john doe will announce the formation of a third party . 
hello ? 
oh . 
yeah ,  i know .  what are you looking for ? 
the websters ! 
that &apos;s your father &apos;s diary ,  ann . 
say that again . 
you made it up . 
our john doe !  the one i made up !  look ,  genius now ,  look .  suppose there was a john doeand he walked into this office .  what would you do ?  find him a job and forget about the whole business ,  i suppose !  not me !  i &apos;d have made a deal with him ! 
who ,  for instance ? 
that &apos;s fine !  that &apos;s fine !   now fall right into their laps .  go ahead .  say john doe walked in and called the whole thing off .  you know what that &apos;s going to sound like on top of this ! 
okay ,  sister ,  you get your job back . 
all right ,  boys ,  here he is . 
well ,  okay .  but we don &apos;t want more than a couple o &apos; hundred people in on this thing .  now the first thing i want is an exact copy of the john doe letter in your own handwriting . 
okay ,  fellows . 
now listen ,  annhe can &apos;t possibly get in without our seeing him .  i &apos;m watching the side door and the colonel &apos;s out front ,  so stop worrying . 
have you seen him ? 
no sense in going up there !  i been here for hours .  he ain &apos;t here ! 
had any schooling ? 
no .  her mother &apos;s awful worried about her .  when she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk .  er ,  the girl ,  i mean ! 
just called the morgue ,  boss .  they say there &apos;s a girl there
yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah . 
a what ? 
all right !  now ,  supposing a certain unmentionable worm ,  whose initials are d .  b .  ,  was trying to use that to shove his way into the white house .  so he could put the screws on ,  so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses .  what would you say about that ?  huh ? 
is that so ?  then what &apos;s a big political boss like hammett doing in town ?  and a labor leader like bennett ?  and a lot of other big shots who are up at d .  b .  &apos;s house right now ?  wolves ,  john ,  wolves waiting to cut up the john does !   wait till you get a gander at that speech you &apos;re gonna make tonight ! 
go down to the office and arrange for some radio time . 
run a story .  say john doe was in here ,  and is sorry he wrote the letter and
that &apos;s a lie ! 
listen ,  folks ,  it &apos;s a fact that i didn &apos;t write the letter ,  but this whole thing started
it &apos;s for ann  .   .   . 
she isn &apos;t ? 
well ,  i guess i &apos;ll see her at the convention later . 
pretty good ?   say ,  i was just about ready for the major leagues when i chipped a bone in my elbow .  i got it pitchin &apos; a nineteen - inning game !

the big picture . 
maranzano wants you dead . 
i &apos;m a hard guy .  i done more jobs than alla you combined .  and i never said no .  not once .  but dammit i don &apos;t understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends !

awwww .  worried about my feelings ,  are you ?  well ,  there &apos;s a new twist . 
dating anyone ? 
i think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer . 
you wouldn &apos;t be in the way .   i like having you around . 
mother ! 
i &apos;m sorry .   i had a wretched night . 
and there was this number on my phone bill that i didn &apos;t recognize .   calls made at three and four in the morning .   so ,  i called the number  .  .  .  and a woman answered .   and i  .  .  .  i hung up .   so ,  then i followed him .   just like in the movies .   and i found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in brooklyn .   we had been going together for almost a year . 
i wonder what they do in there ?   don &apos;t they frighten you ?   they all look so  .  .  . 
where to ? 
i see .   how much ? 
the majority leader ?  right over there .  and that &apos;s  &#93            ] the minority leader .  they &apos;re both pretty good in the clinches . 
i &apos;ll take your hat into the cloak room . 
you &apos;ve never *seen* this contract . 
what &apos;s he bringing pigeons for ? 
when foley died ,  why didn &apos;t i clear out ?  how many times ,  did you hear me say i was fed up on politics and -  -  ?  but *no* -  - i let  &apos;em talk me into staying .  secretary to a leader of little squirts .  why ?  because i need the job and a new suit of clothes . 
what !  who ? 
sit tight ,  diz .  the show commences in just a minute . 
okay .  so what ?  stop worrying .  i &apos;ve told you -  - the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway -  - 
why do i always laugh at that ? 
like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time -  - watchin &apos; the little fella toddling off -  - in his best bib and tucker -  - and you sink in the middle -  - hoping he can stand up to the other kids -  - won &apos;t get his feeling hurt -  - and -  - if you could only spare him the knocks he &apos;s gotta take -  -   say -  - who started this ? 
how about getting married ? 
now ,  now ,  emma ,  dear -  - you mustn &apos;t forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to -  - 
happy ,  for reasons there isn &apos;t time to go into -  - it &apos;s got to be miller !  we &apos;ve given you the man .  now write the ticket .   come on ,  joe .  come on ,  chick . 
*but you never asked me* ! 
yes !  he &apos;s about to blow the whole machine to smithereens -  - and *you with it* ,  mr .  governor ! 
not at all .  i &apos;ve come to pay you a personal and official -  - and i might say -  - a *tardy* tribute ,  mr .  smith ,  for your recent heroic conduct . 
 -  - and it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you .  in my official capacity ,  therefore ,  i -  - 
he &apos;s the greatest *american* we got ,  too ,  dad .  can tell what george washington said -  - by heart .  an &apos;  &quot; boy stuff &apos;s &quot;  got the swellest stuff in it . 
jeff for senator . 
well -  - it started with a little mimeograph sheet -  - and it &apos;s just grown out of all sense and reason -  - 
here they are -  - i got them .  they are all right . 
i know .  i suppose ,  mr .  paine ,  when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that ,  one man by himself can &apos;t get very far ,  can he ? 
gosh !   well -  - looks good as new .  if there *is* any damage ,  i &apos;ll -  - 
y - yes . 
yield *how* ,  sir ? 
will the senator -  - 
mr .  president -  - i did not say that senator paine was one of those congressmen i saw .  if the chair please ,  i will deny that senator paine *saw* taylor or even knows him -  - 
jerry !  blackie !  queenie !  let &apos;s have it quiet ,  fellows ! 
well now -  - just to take an example -  -  putting up a dam -  - on willet creek .  as i look at it -  - that dam &apos;s going to do the people of our state a lot of good -  - 
but you have some objections here and there .  and maybe right ,  for all i know .  but the point is -  - there &apos;s no sense stopping the whole works now -  -  specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through -  - 
what is it ? 
*no* ! 
gee ,  i &apos;m sorry .  you see ,  it wasn &apos;t until i was fairly well along in the bus that i realized -  - 
i don &apos;t believe i &apos;ve been so thrilled in my -  - oh ,  and that lincoln memorial !  gee !  there he is -  - mr .  lincoln -  - looking right at you as you come up the steps -  -  sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along -  - 
if i were *triplets* ,  i couldn &apos;t -  -  .  look ,  senator -  - let me give you a rough idea .  a member has a bill in mind -  - like you -  - a camp .  right ? 
that &apos;s how congress -  - or any large body -  - is run .  all work has to be done by committee . 
that &apos;s the order of business .  your bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the steering committee decides it is important enough to be -  - 
do you really think we &apos;re getting anywhere . 
pardon ? 
no !  go right ahead ,  miss saunders . 
on paper ? 
yes ,  yes -  - 
no !  gosh !  i better get moving here ,  miss saunders -  -   everybody else calls you just plain  &quot; saunders .  &quot;  why can &apos;t i ? 
saunders .  that &apos;s better .   good morning ,  saunders .  hello ,  saunders .  how &apos;s the bill coming ,  saunders -  -  ? 
well -  - nobody calls you anything but saunders . 
letitia . 
susan !  susan paine -  - that &apos;s beautiful -  - 
uh -  - willet creek .  it &apos;s just a little stream -  - 
you couldn &apos;t .  you &apos;ve never been out there ,  you said . 
gee -  - i hope so .  what &apos;s all this ? 
already ?  all these letters ? 
do you mean all -  - look -  - look we &apos;d better open them up -  - see what they say here -  - look at the money -  - what does it say -  -  &quot; dear senator smith ,  i would like to come to your boy &apos;s camp and i shine shoes at the station and here &apos;s nine cents .  &quot;  oh ,  isn &apos;t that wonderful .  look and he signs it .   &quot; yours truly ,  stinky moore .  &quot;  isn &apos;t that marvelous ?   say -  - have i got some paper here ? 
good !  i &apos;m going to be pretty busy tonight -  - 
i -  - i -  - gee whiz -  - i didn &apos;t thank you ! 
yes -  - right here .  just a second -  -   miss paine . 
yay ! 
where do we go from here ? 
fine -  - they &apos;re fine .   oh ,  miss paine ,  i -  - i want to apologize -  -  what the papers said i said about you -  - that wasn &apos;t true .  i -  - i would never say a thing like that . 
oh -  - you are ! 
well ,  goodbye ,  sir -  - and thank you again .   well -  - it -  - it was nice seeing you ,  miss paine -  - 
funnier things have happened .  ma says when pa was courting her ,  he acted strange for months .  didn &apos;t make sense -  - or anything .  and one day ,  on a hunch ,  ma said :   &quot; clayton ,  so help me ,  you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear .  &quot;   &quot; not the collar ,  mary ,  &quot;  he said ,   &quot; my shoes .  &quot;   &quot; well ,  for land &apos;s sake ,  &quot;  ma said ,   &quot; take the pesky things off !  &quot;  which pa did ,  an &apos; they were engaged within a week . 
the senator understands he is limited to five minutes ? 
what !  who ? 
that won &apos;t work ,  chick .  this boy &apos;s honest ,  not stupid . 
who ?  who ?  your boss !  a nut ,  huh ?  a nut !  wow !  there &apos;s a *story* in this guy -  -  !  i smelled it ! 
and i &apos;m an old hand at following instructions -  - 
yeah ?   and what else ? 
all right -  - *yes* !  and what does that make me to him ?  *nothing* !  i &apos;ve got to go about my own business -  - and forget it ! 
a young patriot ?  -  - who recites jefferson and lincoln ?  -  - turned loose in our nation &apos;s capital ?  i think i can . 
well ,  what do you want me to do ?  stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that willet creek dam appropriation around my neck .  either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or i &apos;ll break him so wide open they &apos;ll never be able to find the pieces . 
oh ,  it &apos;s all right -  - it &apos;s all right .  it seems a shame ,  though ,  to part company like this after all these years ,  especially now with a national convention coming up .  joe ,  i &apos;ve put everything i have behind you .  and so did all of our friends ,  but i guess we &apos;ll survive .  we &apos;ll just have to find somebody else that &apos;s got a little more sense ,  that &apos;s all .  in the meantime ,  you explain to mr .  smith about willet dam .  it &apos;s your bill -  -  it &apos;s your reputation ,  and if he can &apos;t find enough facts to break you with ,  you just send him to me and i &apos;ll give him a couple of good ones .  i &apos;m taking the next plane home . 
jim -  - the boy &apos;s talking to that state -  -  the story is out -  -  ! 
i accuse this man -  - by his tone -  - by his careful denials -  - he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct -  -  !  *i &apos;ll* tell you why we were in tht room .  because mr .  taylor ,  a respected citizen of our state ,  had brought with him the evidence against this man ,  later presented from this floor ,  and *we were urging him to resign* -  -   ! 
yeah ,  mr .  cobb said stick to your tail no matter what . 
i say ,  my friend ,  do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds ? 
they think he &apos;s pixilated . 
all right ,  mr .  dodsworth .  i think you &apos;ll qualify .   take this to that desk over there for further instructions . 
thank you ,  your honor .  are you employed by the morning mail ? 
are they true ! 
and you saw them happen ? 
oh ,  that was so lovely .  thank you . 
you &apos;ve been having quite an exciting time here ,  haven &apos;t you ?   all those meetings and business deals and society people  -  haven &apos;t you been having fun ? 
gosh ,  you look pretty tonight . 
huh ?   oh .  they said i was crazy .  said i wanted to run it like a grocery store . 
have you seen the papers ? 
would you like to walk the rest of the way ?  it &apos;s so nice out . 
to most people ,  it &apos;s an awful letdown . 
here &apos;s a nice place . 
you said i was a lady in distress . 
the drums .  he taught me to play some . 
couldn &apos;t sleep .  kinda wanted to talk to you .  do you mind ? 
yes ,  if it isn &apos;t too late . 
in a day or so ,  i think . 
good night . 
uh - huh . 
why there she is !   of course she &apos;s home .   stupid of me  .   .   . 
look ,  i can do it ! 
with pay ! 
why ,  babe  -  that &apos;s terrific !    &quot; cinderella man woos mystery girl !  who is the mysterious girl that &quot; 
tell him you &apos;re babe bennett ?  tell him you &apos;ve been making a stooge out of him ? 
it &apos;s for you .  in a couple weeks you &apos;ll get the itch so bad ,  you &apos;ll be working for nothing . 
come on ,  come on ! 
yeah .  mac threw cobb out again . 
we &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .  he &apos;s as naive as a child . 
don &apos;t want to be critical ,  john ,  but here it is
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room ,  sir .  they &apos;re getting a trifle impatient ,  sir . 
how &apos;s it going ?  okay ? 
gold ,  eh ? 
oh ,  yes ,  sir .  here it is ,  sir .  the pate de fois gras ,  sir . 
i wish you luck ,  sir . 
miss bennett please ! 
the falkner sisters are rather timid ,  your honor ,  and wish to be together .  if the court pleases ,  i will only have one of them testify . 
your honor ,  i object . 
yeah .  a glorified doormat . 
look ! 
okay ,  then .  go to it .   and ,  charlie
how do you do . 
it &apos;s merely a suggestion .  i don &apos;t wish to press the point ,  mr .  deeds ,  but if you &apos;ll give me your power of attorney we &apos;ll take care of everything .  it &apos;ll save you a lot of petty annoyances .  every shark in town will be trying to sell you something . 
well ,  you see ,  your uncle didn &apos;t bother with that sort of thing .  he left everything to us .  he traveled most of the time ,  and enjoyed himself .  you should do the same thing ,  mr .  deeds . 
yes .  that is to say
thanks  oh ,  did you send that telegram to jim mason ? 
gee ,  i &apos;m busy .  did the opera people always come here for their meetings ? 
arthur !  who &apos;s arthur ? 
what do you think bodyguards are for ? 
just as i suspected ,  wise guy !  i don &apos;t mind you making a sap out of yourself  -  but you made one out of me ,  too . 
i &apos;m chairman ? 
we provide opera . 
that &apos;s impossible .  the opera has never paid . 
naturally . 
mrs .  semple ? 
look ,  he &apos;s temperamental . 
i &apos;d like to get in my two cents &apos; worth . 
brookfield just came in . 
that ought to be fun . 
how about lunch ?  are the gentlemen going to stay  -  or not ? 
hear what he said ?  you know how much twenty million is ? 
get up from there .  i don &apos;t want anybody holding the ends of my pants .  get up from there ! 
a prairie oyster ,  sir .  &#93 10]
as a matter of fact ,  you came home without any clothes .  you were in your  -  uh  -  shorts .  yes ,  sir . 
please ! 
we argued on sunday .  he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week ,  like always .  but on thursday ,  when he normally comes home ,  he didn &apos;t .  didn &apos;t call either .  not till saturday afternoon . 
it &apos;s happened before .   i &apos;m shocked by how little i &apos;m feeling .  i can &apos;t understand it .   i &apos;ll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon ,  won &apos;t i ? 
better make yourself comfortable .  we got a three hour drive here . 
my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum .  died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo . 
where &apos;s your wife ,  henry ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
i didn &apos;t see you there .  can i help you ? 
no thanks .  plenty of time for that when we &apos;re a little further along . 
i &apos;ve seen you going by on your board ,  but i didn &apos;t realize  -  -  you &apos;re so young .  .  .  to be so .  .  . 
that &apos;s a lot of people all at once . 
four months ,  two and a half weeks  -  -  that &apos;s how long .   and you &apos;ve already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined . 
you know who that is ,  don &apos;t you ?   you really don &apos;t ?  that &apos;s skip skipperton ,  man .  he gets himself hit by a truck ,  this whole town shuts down . 
do we run into the street ?  no ,  i didn &apos;t think so .   nice car .  how &apos;s that place ? 
shocking .  did you know the government is wasteful ?   you heard it here first .  oh ,  and being a supermodel .  .  .  it &apos;s no walk in the park . 
i want to give you something .  will you let me ? 
here it is ,  some advice  -  -  do the hard thing . 
i &apos;m a criminal lawyer  -  -  you think i like my clients ?  i can &apos;t stand most of them !  but i don &apos;t kick them out .  .  . 
got a license ?   but no car ? 
what &apos;s wrong with her ? 
hiya ,  doc . 
just who is here ,  can you tell me ? 
sofie .  it &apos;s so obvious .  .  .  you &apos;re after my daughter . 
is it contagious ?   &apos;cause everyone agrees my immune system &apos;s way down . 
i &apos;m not making any promises . 
we don &apos;t discuss it . 
i &apos;m embarrassed .  the list is so long . 
yeah ,  most people have that .  it &apos;s confusing here . 
so whose route is this ? 
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out .  i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down . 
i bet i know what changed your mind .  .  .    .  .  . my mother .  she was so horrible ,  you decided you couldn &apos;t desert me . 
it might &apos;ve been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor - patient relationship . 
all right .  .  .  i &apos;m going to come right out and say this ,  because that &apos;s what your shrink is for ,  right ,  so you can tell him what &apos;s bothering you ? 
first of all ,  i have been feeling much better lately .  i don &apos;t know if the syndrome is over  -  -  if it &apos;s just run its course or something  -  -  but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you . 
i &apos;m saying that since i &apos;m doing so much better  -  -  which i attribute to you  -  -  i &apos;m liable to misinterpret some of my feelings . 
i know a little about psychology .  i took three different courses in college .  it &apos;s true ,  none of them were above the two hundred level ,  but i took them .  .  .  and there was one concept i remember very well . 
i guess you saw the show .  .  .  ? 
but nothing .  .  .  i &apos;m mad as hell .  this is a terrible thing you &apos;ve done . 
oh . 
you got off easy . 
the school board doesn &apos;t pay you ?  what kind of deal is that ? 
pro boner ?   pro bono ,  huh ?  for whose good ,  supposedly ? 
what are you talking about ? 
i hope you don &apos;t think i want you to do this for free .  just because we &apos;re gonna play it like we &apos;re friends ,  doesn &apos;t mean i won &apos;t pay you like a doctor . 
i have a lot of money .  do you know how much money i &apos;ve got ? 
lily and i talk a bit .  you know lily ,  runs the coffee shop ? 
well ,  there &apos;s lily . 
what ? 
pretty good ,  too .  lots of detail .  nothing hard core .  old - fashioned ones ,  from back when people cared about atmosphere and character . 
problem is ,  his fantasy life &apos;s a lot better than his real one .  nothing can live up to it .  his wife got sick of it and left him .  took his kids with her . 
hey ,  skip . 
i want to tell you something ,  doc ,  but before i do ,  i need to ask you a question .  .  .  because ,  for me to tell you this thing  -  -  well ,  i haven &apos;t told anybody about this .  it &apos;s the biggest secret i &apos;ve got . 
a doll ? 
 -  -  an investigator for the internal revenue service ? 
but you studied psychology ,  right ?  you did the training and just never got the degree ? 
pretty creepy ,  huh ?  are you totally disgusted ? 
this doesn &apos;t seem a little .  .  .  perverse ? 
i trained in the east ,  myself  -  -  cornell  -  -  and i don &apos;t care what anyone says ,  there really are regional differences .  i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing .  .  .  did you ? 
we saved him !  saved him before the creature could finish his work .  now leave ,  all of you ,  quickly ,  before he finishes you all . 
and what ritual would that be ? 
if he arrives before us ,  it will be too late . 
what then ?  robbery ?  extortion ?  kidnapping ! 
o &apos;connell !  i am going to kill you for this ! 
hey o &apos;connell !  looks to me like i got all the horses ! 
yeah ? 
she is like all the others .  she will die in the desert . 
it will be done .  but what of the american expedition ?  they leave tomorrow as well . 
i &apos;m willin ,  to go on a little faith ,  here . 
which would be located not far to the east of the anubis statue . 
i wouldn &apos;t trade ya for a brass spittoon ! 
two hundred pounds . 
a bright good morning to all . 
how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra ? 
 -  -  i know what you mean .  i was there ,  alright .  seti &apos;s place .  the city of the dead . 
i don &apos;t believe in fairy tales and hokum ,  mister o &apos;connell ,  but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there ,  the book of the living .  it &apos;s what first interested me in egypt as a child .  it &apos;s why i came here ,  sort of a life &apos;s pursuit . 
for what ? 
oh my god ,  .  .  .  it looks like ,  it looks like a sarcophagus . 
unlike your brother ,  miss ,  you i don &apos;t get .  you &apos;re a whole new brew . 
something like that . 
oh my god ,  i &apos;ve dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl . 
according to my readings ,  our friend suffered the hom - dai ,  the worst of all ancient egyptian curses ,  one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers .  in all of my research ,  i &apos;ve never read of this curse actually having been performed . 
yes ,  they never used it because they feared it so .  it &apos;s written ,  that if a victim of the hom - dai should ever arise ,  he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt . 
i think you were jealous
two questions .  who the hell is seti the first ?  and was he rich ? 
yes ,  awfully tempting ,  wasn &apos;t it ? 
lemme get this straight ,  they stuck a sharp ,  red hot poker up your nose ,  cut your brain into small pieces ,  then ripped it all out through your nostrils ? 
tough break . 
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city . 
and what &apos;s that ? 
the bowler ?  i remember him from when i was a kid .  he was killed years ago . 
and you can &apos;t count horst buckholtz anyway . 
the cape .  the turban .  she wouldn &apos;t understand . 
hey .  .  .  you okay ? 
yes ! 
he &apos;ll never make it . 
i hope you won &apos;t take this the wrong way ,  but i couldn &apos;t help but notice .  .  .  that you &apos;re a dead ringer for veronica lake in  &quot; the blue dahlia &quot;  . 
are you an actress ? 
i &apos;d better go . 
most people just want to make money or be famous or something .  but you risk everything ,  just to help people . 
it &apos;s me . 
i &apos;m going inside . 
listen ,  casanova may be a supervillain ,  but he &apos;s got a weakness ,  and i &apos;m it .  maybe  -  -  just maybe  -  -  i can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing . 
just shut up and listen .  hold off the attack as long as you can .  if i can discover the location i &apos;ll call you  -  - 
so how do you know that you &apos;ve ever been invisible ? 
it is not dead .  it is hiding . 
maybe .  but this isn &apos;t about living or dying .  it &apos;s about good versus evil ,  and we &apos;re good ,  whether we like it or not .  .  .  maybe we look a little funny .  .  . 
i &apos;m liking this . 
there &apos;s just not enough of us . 
you know something ?  those guys are really starting to piss me off ! 
we need a break ,  that &apos;s all !  nobody &apos;d ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein ! 
why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can &apos;t pull  &apos;em out without ripping  &apos;em !  
i &apos;m soaked .   oh great . 
maybe she &apos;s right . 
agents ? 
sounds good . 
wow . 
here you go .  
it is ? 
she likes you . 
or batman  -  - 
do we have to ? 
but ,  doc .  .  .  where &apos;s the machine guns ? 
i have heard that story but i do not believe it . 
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure ,  if he decided to make peace with the emperor ,  at least at this time . 
forgive me ,  your majesty ,  i am about to make it . 
if he withdraws his army in good order ,  it will be a serious political defeat .   but ,  if he should be caught on the move ,  with his army ,  in the full grip of winter ,  then it will be a catastrophe .   if your majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence ,  be deceit ,  by any means ,  for another month ,  thus postponing his departure ,  then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of russia . 
and ,  what a great pleasure it is ,  indeed ,  to meet you ,  alexander . 
you can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry ,  because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back .   when they are retreating before infantry ,  they merely trudge along ,  head down . 
yes  -  -  who spoke up ? 
i don &apos;t have to tell you of our latest difficulties . 
i don &apos;t know ,  sire . 
i have just had the most vivid .  .  .  dream .  .  .  about josephine . 
i believe you are acquainted with my brother ,  joseph bonaparte ,  and my aide ,  major junot . 
captain charles ,  i believe you are one of general le clerc &apos;s aides - de -  camp . 
why are you carrying the dog ? 
how did it spread so quickly ? 
but to start a fire like this in five hours  -  -  how is it possible ?  it would take a carefully organized plan ,  tons of combustibles and hundreds of people . 
then what brings you out on such a night ? 
no ,  i &apos;m only here on leave .   my regiment is at valence . 
she will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway . 
ah ,  my dear madame de montesquiou ,  you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child ,  at last .   i was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the empress . 
do you expect me to believe that ? 
were any of them prettier than i am ? 
were any of them married ? 
promise me you will never leave me . 
promise me . 
promise . 
perhaps  -  -  but tell me you promise ,  anyway . 
i didn &apos;t mean the things that i said .  .  .  i was angry and i said more than i meant to . 
that &apos;s all i can say . 
well ,  whatever the hell you wanted to do ,  you are going to tell me everything right now .   do you understand ?  ! 
you couldn &apos;t face telling me what ? 
how do you know ? 
i was in her maid &apos;s room at an inn we stopped at for the night ,  outside of dijon .   it was an adjoining room to madame bonaparte &apos;s . 
you could hear them ? 
may i inform you ,  monsieur ,  that i am major fidon ,  official courier to the court of the emperor napoleon ,  on my way to our embassy at st .  petersburg and ,  in accordance with the rules of the road ,  no one may overtake or pass me . 
will i be able to play the harp ?   it is an instrument of which i am very fond . 
england can make no move against you on the continent without austria .   a reliable treaty with austria would end her hopes in that regard . 
good day to our brothers - in - arms .  have you come to join us ? 
come in . 
napoleon was born at ajaccio in corsica on august 15th ,  1769 .   he had not been a healthy baby and his mother ,  letizia ,  lavished him with care and devotion .   in middle age ,  he would write about her from st .  helena . 
i know alexander .   his imagination must be struck by some great ,  bold ,  powerful stroke ,  and he will come back to me ,  just as he did at friedland . 
that &apos;s a nice piece of heat right there . 
dude ,  dogs hate me .   i don &apos;t know why .  me and k - 9 &apos;s just don &apos;t get along . 
they ever let you hit the switches on that cadillac ? 
must be nice .   i wish we won the lottery .  come up on a million dollars like ya &apos;ll . 
i can &apos;t see !   i can &apos;t see !   daddy !

look ,  roach ,  i know you ain &apos;t never worked in a record shop before and you &apos;re a little excited .   but if pinky catches you doing that x - games shit off his counter top ,  we both getting fired .   you feel me ?

roach ,  what are you doing ? 
i gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow . 
ezal !   ezal ! 
come on ,  baby ,  let &apos;s go in the house . 
during a campaign every speech is important .  this is free media exposure .  primetime news coverage that we couldn &apos;t buy . 
truth is ,  besides the headache i &apos;ve come down with a little lower intestinal havoc .  make my apologies . 
all right ,  i &apos;ll do it . 
aw ,  gee .  i sent her on an errand .

this is for you .  in it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary .  it is her itinerary .  she is presently  -  are you listening ,  mr .  watson ? 
what .  .  .  ? 
he &apos;s dead ? 
you killed him . 
i kill her  -  and you kill me . 
my wife always said i had a problem trusting people . 
i don &apos;t know . 
we have to hurry . 
haven &apos;t you ever seen anybody kiss like that ? 
i said i have to do something . 
please .  something is going to happen .  .  . 
please .  .  . 
oh ,  jesus  .  .  . 
it &apos;s about time i did .  i was one of those guys ,  workaholics .  i worked my ass off for them  -  my wife ,  my daughter .   that &apos;s just what i thought i was supposed to do .

i &apos;m looking for them . 
foreigners !  fuck ! 
you talk to a cop ,  you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead .   do it . 
yeah .

he was a cool one ,  that harper .  never broke . 
what do you figure he done with it ? 
listen to me son .  you got to swear .  swear means promise .  first swear you &apos;ll take care of little pearl .  guard her with your life ,  boy .  then swear you won &apos;t never tell where that money &apos;s hid .  not even your mom . 
leavin &apos; ,  boy ? 
uncle birdie !

you &apos;re just foolin &apos; !  my name &apos;s pearl . 
you &apos;re ruby ,  ain &apos;t you ,  my child ? 
mister powell ? 
is there anythin &apos;  -  -  anythin &apos; .  .  .  ? 
didn &apos;t you have no inkling ? 
john ,  mr .  powell has got something to tell you . 
it &apos;s the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now  -  -  not to beget more . 
are you through praying ? 
you &apos;re miz cooper ,  i take it . 
them kids is yours ? 
the lord is merciful !  what a day is this !   -  -  and there &apos;s little john ! 
what &apos;s wrong ,  john ? 
what &apos;d you all talk about ? 
worked like a charm . 
well at least i have an objective wall to bounce this off .   you believe it &apos;s possible to dream about what &apos;s going to happen ? 
they got a whole system they call  &apos;dream skills &apos; .  so ,  if you have a nightmare ,  for instance like falling ,  right ? 
meanwhile .  .  .  ? 
how you doing ,  pal ? 
please .  i &apos;m gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you .  i just need you be right there to arrest him .  okay ? 
that &apos;ll be exactly half past midnight .  time for me to fall asleep and find him . 
dad !  get us outta here ! 
what &apos;s the coroner got to say ? 
looks like her boyfriend did it .  rod lane .  musician type ,  arrests for brawling ,  dope  -  - 
maybe god &apos;s punishing us all .  .  . 
your father the cop .  that &apos;s a good one .   forget fred krueger .  you don &apos;t want to know ,  believe me . 
guess i should &apos;n &apos;a done it . 
i never touched her . 
how could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it ? 
what you mean  &apos;all at once &apos; ? 
bring me forty - five back . 
i &apos;ll tell you later .   that gurganov ,  you never know whether he &apos;s on his way to the washroom or the secret police . 
you feel it ,  though . 
no ,  that &apos;s not him .  .  . 
let &apos;s fill it with confitures ,  des prunes .  .  . 
and the surprise is there &apos;s nothing in it . 
just a minute  -  -  just a minute  -  -  i have nothing against the idea but i still say let &apos;s go back to the hotel terminus .  moscow made our reservations there ,  we are on an official mission ,  and we have no right to change the orders of our superior . 
she &apos;s right .  .  .   anyhow let &apos;s talk ourselves into it . 
this is the apartment we have reserved for you ,  comrade yakushova .  i hope you like it . 
there &apos;s something else which i know will appeal to you .  a visit to the paris sewers .  they tell me it is extremely instructive . 
comrades .  .  .  i &apos;m out of the omelet . 
and there is a russian saying :   &quot; the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses .  &quot; 
not that we are giving in one inch ,  but tell us .  .  .  what is in your mind ? 
about this telegram to moscow .  why should you bother ?  i &apos;ll write it for you . 
count d &apos;algout is still asleep . 
nonsense .  how can you fight the reds and make yourself agreeable to the whites if you don &apos;t keep up your strength . 
what time have you ,  gaston ? 
i am ,  gaston . 
you know ,  monsieur mercier ,  this is all non - sense . 
halt negotiations immediately .  envoy extraordinary arrives thursday six ten with full power .  your authority cancelled herewith .  razinin . 
well ,  i think it &apos;s getting late .  good night ,  ninotchka . 
what &apos;s the name of that commissar on the board of trade ? 
and if we have to go to siberia .  .  . 
comrade kopalski .  .  . 
how much does this cost ? 
i might be able to accommodate you .  is there some more luggage ? 
allow me ,  comrade . 
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities .  whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you . 
and your own gas cooker ?  that &apos;s marvelous !   naturally it &apos;s not the royal suite .  .  . 
now ,  comrades .  .  .  there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry . 
what can i do about it ? 
you want me to go in there ? 
here &apos;s my passport .  .  .  .  please give me a visa .  i have to leave for russia immediately . 
i want to see a friend of mine .  .  .  a very dear friend .  .  .  .  it &apos;s a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies .  .  .  .  it &apos;s a girl . 
yes ! 
what for .  .  .  why ? 
yes .  could you give me some information ? 
at what intervals does he whistle ? 
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points .  must you flirt ? 
suppress it . 
i see a house that looks like any other house .  what &apos;s remarkable about it ? 
then why don &apos;t we go ?   you might be an interesting subject of study . 
is this what you call the  &quot; butler &quot;  ? 
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade .  would you like to see my wound ? 
glorious ,  analytical .  .  . 
it is out of the question .  if you wish to approach me .  .  . 
then do it through my lawyer ! 
i didn &apos;t follow you . 
i suppose you don &apos;t think that &apos;s funny ? 
you see i couldn &apos;t shout that . 
leon ,  don &apos;t ever ask me for a picture of myself .  .  .  i couldn &apos;t bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer .  .  .  i couldn &apos;t breathe ,  i couldn &apos;t stand it . 
how do you do ? 
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names . 
oo !  darling !  something is the matter . 
oh ,  everything is so wonderful !  it &apos;s getting farther and farther away ! 
thursday . 
are we going to build our little house ? 
it &apos;s dead . 
no music . 
don &apos;t you find that restful ?  .  .  .  why didn &apos;t you come last night ? 
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press ! 
i &apos;ve got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific .   &quot; caviar and blood .  &quot;  swana escapes over the ice ! 
he &apos;s a waiter at the clarence ,  poor devil .  you know him . 
did i hear something about jewels ? 
imagine the carpets of a self -  respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik !  what does she look like ? 
thank you . 
there &apos;s a charming crowd here tonight ,  isn &apos;t there ? 
say it over and over again ,  leon .  words are a wonderful safety valve ,  and that &apos;s what you need  -  -  because you know it &apos;s impossible ,  don &apos;t you ? 
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow . 
i will have to face the consequences ,  but so will you .  don &apos;t forget they will ask how you got them . 
no ,  i just wanted to be absolutely impartial .  both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years .  we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition .  ninotchka now realizes what she is after . 
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five - forty plane to moscow . 
cigarette ? 
i am sorry ,  i don &apos;t want to overstep my position  -  -  but please .  .  .  don &apos;t send me . 
your highness ,  forgive this intrusion ,  but .  .  . 
how &apos;s the job coming ,  bob ? 
well ,  he certainly isn &apos;t acting like it . 
we could get that . 
you want me to put it all in writing ?  over my signature ? 
is it ? 
they went after castro .   in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy .   i don &apos;t think the  &quot; p &quot;  knows what happened ,  but he &apos;s afraid to find out .   it &apos;s got him shitting peach pits . 
eight words back in  &apos;72  -  -   &quot; i covered up .   i was wrong .   i &apos;m sorry &quot;   -  -  and the american public would &apos;ve forgiven him .   but we never opened our mouths ,  john .   we failed him . 
colson doesn &apos;t know about it; he &apos;s pure as a virgin on this one .   it &apos;s just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for .   they were heading to mcgovern &apos;s office later that night . 
i like it .   i like the idea . 
pay him . 
may i say something ,  mr .  president ? 
no ,  sir ,  you did not . 
exactly !   we &apos;ve got to take the war to them .   hit  &apos;em where it hurts  -  -  right in the nuts .   more assassinations ,  more killings .   right ,  al ? 
your lawyers feel it &apos;s the  .  .  .   &quot; smoking gun .  &quot; 
if you resign ,  you can keep your tapes as a private citizen  .  .  .  you can fight them for years . 
that was civil war . 
we can &apos;t survive this ,  sir .   they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt . 
how about a comint classification ?   we put it on the huston plan .   even the designation is classified . 
should we talk to trini about paying these guys ?   or maybe chotiner ? 
bob ,  did i approve the ellsberg thing ?  you know ,  i &apos;m glad we tape all these conversations because  .  .  .  i never approved that break - in at ellsberg &apos;s psychiatrist .   or maybe i approved it after the fact ?   someday we &apos;ve got to start transcribing the tapes . 
just do what i say ,  bob . 
christ ,  you &apos;re right  -  -  gray makes jerry ford look like mozart .   just have helms call him .   helms can scare anybody . 
cue the crowd .   go to the woman &apos;s group .   get the bald guy ,  he &apos;s great  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  he &apos;d just found out about track 2 . 
the blacks are lost ,  the  &quot; schwartzes &quot;  are gone  .  .  . 
you played it perfectly ,  sir  -  -  cocksucker !   he &apos;s going to think twice before he leaks again . 
relax ,  dick ,  it &apos;s just me  .  .  .  the desert &apos;s so beautiful ,  isn &apos;t it ?   i want to go home ,  dick .   time to go home . 
i &apos;m honored ,  dick ,  that you &apos;ve come all this way out here to virginia to visit us at last . 
you &apos;re referring ,  of course ,  to chairing the special operations group as vice president . 
we have recent intelligence that a soviet nuclear submarine has docked at cienfuegos . 
are you tapping kissinger ? 
no . 
i never met the man . 
we took his system out . 
i know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a republican ,  and she &apos;d do anything for the party . 
because if you &apos;re uncomfortable with the epa up your ass ,  try the irs  .  .  . 
fuck it !   he doesn &apos;t like me ,  john !   it &apos;s your fault ,  henry . 
 .  .  .  as the old alliances crumble . 
that &apos;s right !   and if necessary ,  i &apos;ll drop the big one . 
mr .  nixon ,  it is possible for even a president to go too far . 
yes . 
it was illegal ,  what he did . 
hiss was protecting his wife .   i &apos;ve always believed that . 
uh ,  wait  .  .  . 
this isn &apos;t  &apos;48 ,  dick .   they &apos;ll never buy it . 
but it was all we had . 
hi ,  i &apos;m dick nixon . 
what you have to understand ,  mr .  nixon ,  is that we are willing to die for what we believe in . 
 .  .  .  i don &apos;t really know you yet ,  sandy  .  .  .  what do you like ?   i mean ,  what kind of clothes do you like ?   do you like blue  .  .  .  red ? 
no ,  we don &apos;t !   you &apos;re full of shit !  you say you want to end the war ,  so why don &apos;t you ?   my brother died over there last november .   why ?   what good was his death ? 
someone wants it  .  .  .   you can &apos;t stop it ,  can you ?   even if you wanted to .   because it &apos;s not you .  it &apos;s the system .   and the system won &apos;t let you stop it  .  .  . 
bernstein . 
so i &apos;m supposed to be  .  .  . 
there &apos;s more  .  .  .  there &apos;s more than just me .   you can &apos;t break ,  my boy ,  even when there &apos;s nothing left .   you can &apos;t admit ,  even to yourself ,  that it &apos;s gone ,  al .   do you think those pows in there did ? 
we don &apos;t have to put ourselves through this again ,  dick . 
thank you ,  fidel castro . 
amen to that . 
what are you saying ?   what are you talking about ? 
it would ruin us ,  buddy ,  our family . 
we can be happy .   we really can .   we love you ,  dick .   the girls and i .  .  . 
buddy ?   .  .  . 
they love you ,  buddy .   they need you ,  too . 
you &apos;re the strongest woman i ever met .  i love you ,  buddy . 
are you okay ? 
i &apos;m the only left ,  dick .   if you don &apos;t talk to me ,  you  .  .  . 
no ,  it isn &apos;t .   i won &apos;t interfere with you anymore .   i &apos;m finished trying . 
but being out of the game gives me time to write . 
you heard it ? 
 .  .  . your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy .  i done that my own self .  loretta says you &apos;re quittin &apos; . 
nineteen zero and nine .

why do they keep calling you george ? 
i just want everything to be perfect between us . 
yeah ,  i felt that way ,  too ,  when i first started ,  but now .  .  .  the hours ,  the repetition .  .  .  it &apos;s not all glamour and mall openings anymore .  maybe i should &apos;ve listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier ,  i don &apos;t know .  .  .    .  .  . i just hope it &apos;s not too late for me .  god !  listen to me ,   &quot; me ,  me ,  me .  &quot;  it &apos;s so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself .  stop ,  right ?  that &apos;s it ,  no more about me tonight ,  i promise .  .  .  let &apos;s talk about you .  .  .  what do you think about me ?  i &apos;m kidding .  .  .  seriously ,  betty ,  i &apos;m doing all the talking here .  .  .

so ,  call me when you  -  - 
i don &apos;t need one ,  but it &apos;s kind of a special night ,  and  -  -

you &apos;re in serious danger ! 
have you checked the trunk of that car you &apos;re driving ,  betty ?  i think there might be .  .  . 
so you &apos;re into  &quot; reason ,  &quot;  too ?  finally ,  someone civilized !  i &apos;m ellen ,  what can i get you ?

i &apos;m getting back with my ex - fianc .  he proposed to me right around here ,  so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop .  .  .

yeah .  .  .  sounds like the constitution to me .  with a little of the bill of rights thrown in .  .  . 
no .  i &apos;ve seen black men handing out bags of food .  having meetings .  patrolling the neighborhood .  having more meetings .  they ain &apos;t .  .  . 
i can &apos;t .  .  .  they don &apos;t operate that way .  .  . 
judge ,  hold on ,  is your phone safe ?

you better just kill me tyrone .  and when huey gets out ,  when oakland &apos;s just wall to wall junkies ,  you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got .  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be real happy about that . 
motherfuck .  .  .  well then i got something to do . 
yeah .  .  .  cop hit me .  .  . 
do you think frances with an  &quot; e &quot;  is too manly a name for a girl ? 
maybe we &apos;ll be lucky this winter and have just rain ,  no snow . 
well ? 
how did this .  .  .  how did i let this happen ? 
two pounds ,  fourteen ounces . 
thank you ,  colonel .  .  .  i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know your name . 
you are familiar with how these things are done .   in fact ,  i would like to claim aggrieved status . 
i beg to differ .   one is a command decision on your part .   the other represents nothing more than the occasional over - exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances . 
their names ,  ranks and posts ? 
what news ? 
is that why the assembly was convened ? 
and the governor ? 
less than a mile .   forty - one wagons ,  a company of redcoat infantry ,  horses at the rear . 
father ,  there &apos;s something else i need to talk to you about . 
don &apos;t go in there . 
if this war is about more than thomas ,  it &apos;s about more than anne ,  as well .   stay the course . 
captain marion ,  i understood you to be a patriot . 
a long time ago .  .  . 
there are a thousand avenues ,  other than war ,  at our disposal .  .  . 
one of yours ? 
i &apos;ll see to it that he serves under me . 
fall ,  six months at the earliest . 
goodbye ,  francis . 
and congratulations on the birth of your son . 
yes ,  quite ,  but you should know that .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry . 
thank you . 
gray . 
not yet ,  thomas . 
it &apos;s gorgeous ! 
there are no ghosts ,  ellie .  i want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense . 
well ,  it &apos;s actually reincarnation ,  but you get the idea .  and some people think we just wink out .  .  . like a candle flame when the wind blows hard . 
what were you listening to ? 
i can hardly read these . 
this was their burying ground ,  louis . 
ayuh .  .  . how is your cat ,  louis ? 
i &apos;ll bite -  - what &apos;s the bottom of the truth ,  jud ? 
leave me alone ! 
you &apos;re not really going over to have a beer with that old guy ,  are you ? 
i think it &apos;s rather extraordinary . 
getting there . 
you stole my boat . 
enough of that !   name your terms . 
allow me the humor of listening to your terms . 
the situation has changed . 
that &apos;s proper ,  sir ,  according to the code . 
because it &apos;s what you &apos;re searching for .   you &apos;ve been searching for it for years .   i recognize this ship .  i saw it eight years ago ,  when we made the crossing from england . 
no ,  no ,  nothing like that .   very well .   you hand that over ,  we &apos;ll put your town to our rudder and ne &apos;er return . 
man overboard ! 
you &apos;re speaking up for him again ? 
i could never forget it ,  miss swann . 
i can &apos;t believe he would make such a sacrifice for us . 
you are despicable . 
you ?  ! 
come on ! 
captain sparrow !   we have to get off this island  -  -  immediately ! 
drink up me hearties ,  yo ho  .  .  . 
nothing  .  .  .  it &apos;s nothing .   just  .  .  .  i &apos;m reminded of a song i learned as a child .   a song about pirates . 
he might delay the rescue  .  .  .  and that would be too late . 
these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed . 
say again ? 
how did you get off the island ? 
jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew .   he was marooned on an island ,  left there to die . 
raise the sails . 
sir !   shall i break out the cannons ? 
dead serious . 
the ship &apos;s real enough .   so its anchorage must be a real place .  where is it ? 
never .   they took miss swann . 
why are brothering with that ? 
is that so ? 
just do it quickly . 
you &apos;ve seen the black pearl ? 
you &apos;ve seen a ship with black sails that &apos;s crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out ? 
he may be . 
that jack sparrow  .  .  .  he talked about the black pearl . 
what happened here ? 
has my daughter given you an answer yet ? 
you can &apos;t mean that . 
pollution ? 
this is our world ,  susan ,  and once you realize that ,  you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven .   science is the quest for divine perfection . 
it remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy .  history is written by the victor . 
i know what you &apos;re doing . 
please ,  o &apos;brien ,  don &apos;t do this to me !   i &apos;ll give you anything you want ! 
gently ,  ott .   gently . 
it will be an ascension . 
facts ,  dr .  nebbleman .   facts .  you &apos;ve been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
of course you understand ,  dr .  argon ,  that once the nanobot is inside of you ,  there is no going back  -  - 
here ,  kid ,  this is great stuff .   why don &apos;t you give it a try ? 
haw - haw !   why don &apos;t you run off and find a cop and i &apos;ll wait right here . 
what did security say ? 
well ,  you got another problem . 
there &apos;s a guard outside my door !  i &apos;m a prisoner ,  nigel !   do you understand that ? 
like crazy glue ? 
susan ! 
when did you .  .  .  ? 
yeah . 
nothing really worthwhile . 
god ,  daniel ,  i &apos;m not going to make agent orange . 
please ,  susan !   i need help !  something is wrong with me ! 
oh no ,  no ,  no !   you &apos;ve got to be able to fix me !   please ,  susan ,  tell me you can make me normal again ! 
oh no .   they &apos;re trying to blame you for the accident .   that means they must not have been able to control the replicators . 
i didn &apos;t know what was going to happen .   i was just so worried something was going to happen to you . 
you saved my life . 
that means the nanobot is still inside him . 
you &apos;re not going after argon ! 
that &apos;s impossible . 
if this nutcase did take it and has half a brain ,  he &apos;d use it right away ,  before we could invalidate it . 
oh ,  stew and i went for a long ride .   dexter ,  is there any finishing school we can send him to ? 
indeed ?  how interesting . 
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re quite willing to be decent about this . 
what do you want ? 
will  -  uh  -  five thousand be enough ? 
you &apos;re a peculiar person .  why the other day i pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
a little ?  sure ,  i &apos;ll be right up .   he &apos;s all right .  i like him . 
that was kind of a rotten thing to do ,  anne .  after all ,  gallagher is my friend .  the least you can do is be courteous to her . 
now wait a minute .  aren &apos;t you being a little unreasonable ? 
this is something i should have done a long time ago ,  only i didn &apos;t have sense enough to do it .  no ,  i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning .  but no more .  no more !  so that &apos;s that . 
fine !   i don &apos;t blame her .  i know i &apos;m out of my own crowd .  i should have had better sense in the beginning .  but i &apos;ll stay in my own backyard from now on . 
what is this person doing here ? 
fine .  have a seat . 
so ,  you see how silly that rumor is ? 
say ,  take it easy !  take it easy !  listen ,  my boy .  no use you hanging around here .  just buy the tribune tonight and read all about it .  you can rewrite it for your last edition . 
oh ,  is that so ? 
would you like to have me turn around for you ,  bingy ? 
big chief bingy come to white man &apos;s tepee to make friends .  big chief very sorry .  to show how sorry  -  will bend over and let white man kick big chief where sun never shines . 
look ,  i quit ! 
yeah ,  little gloria . 
now listen boss ,  if you &apos;re going to kick about that expense account
not on my own beat ,  no . 
i &apos;ve heard of people being scooped on their own funerals ,  but this !  holy mackerel !  why ,  it &apos;s news when anne schuyler gets her fingernails manicured ,  but this !  she gets married to one of our own reporters and the tribune beat us to it !   well !  what do you guys want ?  go on ,  get back to your desks .  go back to your work .   now don &apos;t tell me you were drunk at the time and don &apos;t remember !  or is this one of bingy &apos;s snow - storms ? 
gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story  - 
and live on your salary ,  i suppose ? 
the one about the siberian bloodhound ? 
well ,  i &apos;m sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  let me know when you &apos;re quitting . 
who are you ? 
dawson ,  huh ?  was i very drunk last night ? 
did you take anything out of those pants ? 
yes . 
stew ,  your hands are shaking .  you &apos;ve been drinking again . 
sure ,  you ran away .  aren &apos;t you going to congratulate a guy ? 
oh sure ,  we &apos;ll be happy .  what &apos;s the matter with your eyes ? 
my error . 
mr .  smith ,  i &apos;ve read some of your plays and i &apos;d like an autograph . 
i &apos;m pinch - hitting for our society editor tonight .  i wanted to see some life in the raw . 
well ,  gallagher !  glad to see you . 
you know what i should do with you ?  i should sock you right in that funny little nose . 
stewart ,  have you ever been to old madrid ? 
didn &apos;t he go to sea before he wrote about it ? 
then why don &apos;t you write about something you know ?   write about yourself and anne .  the poor boy who marries a rich girl  -  now there &apos;s a swell theme . 
what other girl ? 
nice set of conrads you have out there ,  mrs .  schuyler .  i was just glancing through this one .   what &apos;s michael tearing the paper about ? 
well ,  well .  that takes it out of the rumor class ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
i &apos;ve tried to stop the evening papers ,  but it &apos;s useless . 
traps shut ! 
i don &apos;t eat waffles . 
remember what i told you about that twentieth crack ?  all right ,  you &apos;ve just made it .  before you go unconscious i want you to get this through your nut . 
okay  -  you remember joe
some bicarbonate  -  quick ! 
yes  -  the worm ! 
now ,  now jeeves .  &#93 5] was that nice ?  was that being a gentleman ,  jeeves ?  was it ,  jeeves ?  your name is jeeves ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
did you call ,  sir ? 
found no skeletons ? 
well ,  isn &apos;t that nice ?  you just go right ahead and putter with your hands .  that &apos;s all right .  how do you do it ? 
yes sir . 
can i ask you a question ? 
it &apos;s okay .  it &apos;s alright . 
and  .  .  .  wear this on the trip in case it gets cold . 
oh ,  hello betty . 
i just thought  .  .  .  it &apos;s beautiful . 
no she &apos;s not . 
bud ,  your sister &apos;s a little older now and she &apos;s naturally going to start going out with boys .    .  .  .  in fact pretty soon -  - she &apos;s even going to get married and make someone a good little home - maker like your mother here .   that &apos;s if she can learn to bake . 
look at me george .  that meeting &apos;s not for me .  look at my face . 
i sure am glad you said you &apos;d come out with me tonight mary sue . 
i don &apos;t know if i ever said this to you before ,  but ,  well  .  .  .  i think you &apos;re just about the keenest girl in the whole school  .  .  . 
mary sue -  - c &apos;mon  .  .  . 
oh .   i can &apos;t . 
i don &apos;t believe it . 
you want to ask her out tonight ,  right ?  and then you want to give her your school pin  .  .  . 
what i mean is  .  .  .  mary sue &apos;s been a little  &quot; different &quot;  lately  .  .  . 
what &apos;ll it be ? 
want some bridge mix ? 
betty &apos;s making some pineapple kabobs  .  .  . 
you &apos;re not allowed to do this !  i could arrest you for this . 
good .  do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to ,  and in plain sight of ,  minor children ? 
because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus ! 
this behavior will stop at once . 
dan !  arrest them ! 
mr .  simpson  .  .  . 
what color is that hedge of yours ? 
what did you do ? 
oh god . 
who &apos;s that ? 
does he -  - you know -  - like  &quot; me &quot;  ? 
those are my friends . 
can we do any better ? 
it &apos;s too weird david .  this place is giving me the creeps .  did you know all the books are blank ? 
jen ,  listen  .  .  . 
so what &apos;s the point ? 
are you sure ? 
keeps going  .  .  . 
you want some berries ? 
i picked them myself .  they grow wild up here .   mmm .  so sweet . 
what do we do ? 
mcintire &apos;s . 
where are you going  .  .  . 
i want a word with you  .  .  . 
i had nothing to do with that . 
where &apos;s the remote control i gave you ? 
because you &apos;re coming home . 
there &apos;s worse places . 
you know how when we close up ,  i close the register ,  then you lower the shades ,  then i turn out the lights ,  then we both lock the doors . 
well  .  .  .  i &apos;m not sure i see the point anymore . 
this is barry . 
did you think that we &apos;d all be looking at you ? 
it &apos;s hard to understand because it says in addition to but i can &apos;t exactly understand in addition to what because there &apos;s actually nothing to add it too .  .  . 
yes ,  indeed ,  yes i am . 
oh yeah no i don &apos;t want to do that . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to the party . 
why ? 
seriously ,  though :  we &apos;re going to eat ,  i said . 
 -  -  do you think you &apos;ll ask her out ? 
did you ask walter to get you a shrink ?   barry ,  did you ask walter to get you a shrink ?  what &apos;s wrong with you ?  are you ok ? 
you &apos;re so scared . 
really ? 
hello ? 
yes . 
i can &apos;t really .  yeah ,  no .  i mean .  i can &apos;t afford it . 
yes i can &apos;t .  .  .  . i don &apos;t make enough money to be able to do that . 
hello ? 
this makes me very uncomfortable . 
should i just ask your girlfriend ?   maybe i should call back and talk to your girlfriend ? 
are you telling me no ? 
 .  .  . motherfucker ,  no .  .  .  . 
they &apos;re not open yet ? 
i thought they opened at seven .   if i left my car would it be ok ? 
do you know them . 
maybe i &apos;ll see you later ,  when i pick up my car ? 
business is good ,  you &apos;re busy ? 
alright ? 
 .  .  .  . i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  . i lost my thoughts ,  what i was saying .  .  .  . 
 -  -  the promotion says :  buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1 , 000 for purchases made with a special coupon .  so in the supermarket ,  you notice their products ,  first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1 . 79  -  that &apos;s a pretty good deal .  .  .  . but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can .  .  .  .  . and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it &apos;s a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup .  now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label .  that &apos;s those little bar codes ,  you know ?  the universal product codes ? 
you see if you spent $3 , 000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles . 
 .  .  .  . no .  .  .  . 
no i didn &apos;t say that . 
are you learning how to play it ? 
i don &apos;t freak out . 
 .  .  . what .  .  .  ? 
that &apos;s right you travel so much . 
yeah . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
 .  .  .  . i &apos;m not exactly sure what that means .  .  . 
if you wanted to call me back i could .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know . 
can i pay you here ?  can i pay you for our drinks and salad ?

 &quot; and so the professor lifted colombe &apos;s skirt high ,  above her waist .   &apos;let me be your tutor ,  &apos; said he ,   &apos;in the ways of love .  &apos; with that ,  he slid her pantalettes down ,  down ,  down over her knees ,  and there  -  -  nestled between her legs  -  -  as pink as a tulip ,  as slick as an eel  -  -  &quot; 
madeleine  -  - 
in part ,  yes . 
free his mouth . 
care for a splash of wine ,  abbe ? 
yes !  it is !  the paper &apos;s cheap ,  the type &apos;s too small  -  - 
but you implored me to write !  for curative purposes ,  to stave off my madness  -  - 
have you truly read the book in question ?  or did you run  -  -  straightaway  -  -  to the dog - eared pages ? 
there i was taxed; it &apos;s true . 
fuck  &apos;em !  they &apos;re half - wits and pinheads .  let  &apos;em die on the streets ,  as nature intended . 
why this sudden torture ? 
you &apos;re a man of science; i &apos;m a man of god .  charenton stands to profit from us both ,  i &apos;m certain . 
and he &apos;s never once attempted escape ? 
it &apos;s essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind . 
unless we set charenton on a straight and narrow course ,  she &apos;ll be shut down forever by order of the emperor . 
you &apos;re a sentimental man . 
on the contrary .  let me take up this matter with the marquis myself  -  - 
he &apos;s more than a patient ,  doctor; the marquis is my friend  -  - 
you &apos;ll get more from her with kindness than you will with force . 
my darling ,  eugenie ,  dainty morsel !  get on your back !  let &apos;s try it dorsal ! 
i &apos;ll plunder every lovely pore until you &apos;re week and cry  &quot; no more !  &quot; 
and then  -  -  to prove your truly mine  -  -  i &apos;ll plunder you ,  darling ,  from behind ! 
 &quot; a habitu of cemeteries ,  his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior ,  deceased a dozen years .  &quot; 
i &apos;m only a laundress; not a detective . 
did i frighten you ? 
the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass ,  the darling of the lower wards ,  where they entomb the criminally insane . 
i must say ,  in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations . 
tomorrow night ,  whisper a new tale to your neighbor ,  cleante .  he &apos;ll whisper it to his neighbor dauphin ,  who &apos;ll whisper it to his neighbor franval  -  - 
you &apos;re new to charenton ,  yes ?  perhaps you &apos;re not yet familiar with my husband ,  and his unusual case . 
i assume you &apos;ve come to plead for clemency on your husband &apos;s behalf . 
perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them .  .  . 
don &apos;t toy with me ,  doctor . 
doctor .  .  .  can i impart to you his cruelest trick ? 
you &apos;ve no right to assault me in this fashion; i &apos;ll call for my footman .  i &apos;ll have you removed  -  - 
everywhere i go ,  they point and whisper !  at the opera ,  they hiss at me when i take my box .  when i went to church .  .  .  the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said i was already damned !  why must i suffer for your sins ? 
yeah ,  orson &apos;s a real piece of work .  but deep down ,  he &apos;s a good kid .  real deep down . 
uh - huh
the actor
intimately .  for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others .  i have been swimming in blood my entire life .  but i retain a belief ,  perhaps you will think it old fashioned ,  undoubtedly you will ,  but i believe that private lives should not be public property . 
see what you can do about this citizen kane picture ,  won &apos;t you ? 
goddamn it .  i gotta have some kinda life ! 
he is a bolshevik .  he will have us at war by the end of the year .  i think i &apos;m going to run that wheelchair picture . 
we &apos;re 125 million dollars in debt ? 
then you explain it to me ?  ! 
that  -  -  did you need that ?  how much did that cost ? 
did you need it ?  did you need any of it ? 
there &apos;s a different between want and
it &apos;s all you .  it has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with pulitzer and the castle .  and  .  .  .  marion . 
thank you for your time

do you suppose it &apos;s ethical to watch a man with binoculars ,  and a long -  focus lens  -  -  until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck ,  and almost read his mail  -  -  do you suppose it &apos;s ethical even if you prove he didn &apos;t commit a crime ?

did you find your franklin mint egg ,  rosemary darling ? 
chip is off to a fine start this year .   focused .  .  .  conscientious .  .  .  participates actively in classroom discussion . 
what is it ,  mr .  stubbins ? 
certainly not ! 
are we leaving ? 
then you know that if i give you a little advice ,  it &apos;ll be good advice . 
look ,  sister &apos; ,  manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide .  i ain &apos;t never been off it .  i know it like you know your own back yard .  you get me a small retainer  -  - say fifty bucks ,  and i &apos;ll get your sister for you .  i guarantee
you can &apos;t tell . 
may i have some water ?  i &apos;m thirsty . 
i &apos;ve come from jacqueline .  she needs money . 
 i didn &apos;t .  she came to me a few days ago .  to put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me .  she thought you might lighten that burden . 
i &apos;m afraid she can &apos;t do that ,  ward .  it would endanger her . 
well ,  then i can tell you that in addition to other dangers ,  there is a grave danger of jacqueline losing her sanity .  i would advise against you seeing her . 
i haven &apos;t got that much in cash . 
about forty - five dollars . 
it &apos;s on peary street .  just ask the people who run it .  they &apos;ll remember her .   people who see miss jacqueline never forget her . 
i can &apos;t see much fun in teaching school .  why don &apos;t you go into the beauty business . 
do you know what this is ,  frances ? 
what did she want to know ? 
but i &apos;d give a great deal to know . 
at least i can explain that ,  mary .  your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn &apos;t worth living unless one could end it .  i helped her get that room . 
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline &apos;s husband . 
i &apos;m going to find your sister . 
well ? 
she &apos;ll have to know some time . 
i &apos;m tired of being afraid  -  of waiting . 
please ,  jacqueline . 
were you going to make a suggestion ? 
well , then i have spoiled your dinner  -  -   &quot; your food won &apos;t digest ,  and your wine will sour .  &quot; 
jacqueline .  mr .  romari phoned me .  she went out this afternoon with two men he &apos;d never seen before . 
why can &apos;t everyone be happy like we are  -  -  laugh and have good times .  look at that poor little one  so sad because she can &apos;t find her sister .  and that man with her  -  he doesn &apos;t make her laugh  he just sits and talks . 
well ,  it won &apos;t work .  love and understanding won &apos;t make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet . 
i &apos;m afraid this is no time to play cyrano ,  my friend .  what was in your mind ? 
dr .  judd ? 
yes .  you could become a country wife  -  -  fool around with petunias and pullets . 
i &apos;d hardly describe it that way  -  the worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing . 
perhaps ,  natalie ,  this is a bargain you &apos;re offering me  -  - i am being allowed to join  -  -  to buy safety by betraying jacqueline  -  -  is that it ? 
but you would like to know where she is ? 
but i &apos;m not coming to you out of deep conviction ,  i &apos;m coming to you out of loss .  i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good . 
yes . 
i can almost feel your doubt about what i &apos;m saying ,  mary . 
once you &apos;d seen my sister you &apos;d never forget her . 
i &apos;ll be right back with mrs .  wheeler . 
it is a very real danger and one which forces our decision . 
i have taken care of mary .  i &apos;ve spoken to her .  she &apos;s going back to school . 
sorry .  i &apos;m nervous .  this is very trying for me . 
oh ,  i like it .  i like it very much . 
oh ,  definitely .  i mean ,  just this past year has gone by like phew !  i hardly even knew it passed . 
why &apos;d you drop out ? 
that &apos;s hard to believe .  the two of you seem so different . 
this food is excellent . 
do you understand what i &apos;m trying to say ? 
so what &apos;s your personal thing ?  are you really going to tell me something personal ? 
well ,  my therapist knows me intimately . 
so since i &apos;ve never had sex with you ,  by your own advice i shouldn &apos;t accept your advice . 
it &apos;s a personal project i &apos;m working on . 
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men . 
what about sex ? 
you just ask them questions ? 
and they just answer them ? 
this is just .  .  .  so .  .  . 
john and cynthia have been .  .  .   &quot; fucking &quot;  . 
how do you pay for all this ?  i mean ,  rent ,  and tapes and this equipment . 
yes . 
her name was elizabeth . 
i can &apos;t . 
wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  what &apos;s going on here ?  did you come back here just to see her again ? 
but that was part of it ? 
all right ,  you want to talk about lies ,  let &apos;s talk about lies ,  ann .  let &apos;s talk about lying to yourself .  you haven &apos;t been able to sleep with your husband because you &apos;re no longer in love with him ,  and maybe you never were .  you haven &apos;t been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember . 
jesus christ !  what the hell happened ?  i came home and your car was gone ,  the door was open ,  i thought for sure you &apos;d been abducted by some mad fucker ,  i was literally just calling the cops when you walked in .  what happened ? 
where did you go when you left here ? 
you son of a bitch !  ! 
god damn you !  ! 
yes ,  i remember .  what do you do when these moods overtake you ? 
no ,  i didn &apos;t . 
do you have any idea what triggered this concern ? 
ann ,  do you see a pattern here ? 
what upsets you about that ? 
this unexpected visit notwithstanding ,  how are things with john ? 
what do you mean ,  like physically ? 
do you want to leave therapy ? 
is he ?  strange ,  i mean ? 
i think you &apos;re afraid to put the two of us in the same room together .  i think you &apos;re afraid he &apos;ll be undeniably drawn to me . 
i just thought it might  -  - 
because i never got around to it . 
well ,  like ,  i don &apos;t want to tell you ,  exactly . 
what !  ? 
he wouldn &apos;t do that . 
i feel like i do . 
she called you that ,  too .  may i ask why you &apos;re here ? 
no ,  i really can &apos;t .  i find it healthy never to characterize people i don &apos;t know or conversations i haven &apos;t heard .  i don &apos;t know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else .  last time i saw ann she left here very .  .  .  confused ,  i would say .  and upset . 
oh ,  okay .  i think i get it . 
doing what ? 
do i sit or stand ? 
i &apos;d rather sit .  are you ready ? 
i am now recording .  tell me your name . 
what did he say ? 
prettier than ann ? 
hello . 
look ,  i &apos;m just going to come right out and tell you why i &apos;m here ,  okay ? 
i &apos;m sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer . 
i &apos;m sorry .  i can &apos;t do it . 
well ,  maybe i could just start a rumor ,  then . 
john ? 
hello . 
when ? 
do you want me to stop calling ? 
that you .  .  .  you don &apos;t even know the guy . 
i felt like it ,  so what ?  goddam ,  you and ann make such a big deal out of it . 
hung up . 
plus first and last month deposit . 
get rid of the car when you get your apartment ,  then you &apos;ll still have one key . 
what tapes ? 
may i ask who &apos;s calling ? 
 .  .  . probably nothing at all .  it &apos;s probably just a bunch of ,  i don &apos;t know ,  fatty cysts .  you can have them removed in a doctor &apos;s office .  has nick seen a doctor ? 
well ,  look .  how &apos;s this ?  you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr .  st .  luc .  .  .    .  .  . you tell him that nick &apos;s ill ,  he &apos;s got these lumps ,  and he can &apos;t get out of bed .  tell him to come when you &apos;re sure nick &apos;ll be home .  and don &apos;t tell nick anything .  let the two of them fight it out . 
mrs .  ementhal &apos;s ready and waiting ,  doctor . 
where is he now ?  do you know ? 
go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second - degree burns .  it &apos;ll have to do for now .   what &apos;s your number ?  the number of your apartment ? 
good shape for an old man ,  eh ? 
yeah ,  well ,  i &apos;m flattered ,  but you won &apos;t find any real meat in them . 
he didn &apos;t make it . 
how &apos;s brad ? 
sin - i - ful
in my time they used to call me the merlin of berlin . 
oh ,  oliver ,  you &apos;re so tolerant .  time for a coffee before you rush off ? 
mckinley ?  .  .  . mckinley ? 
conspiracy ?   that sounds a little farfetched . 
i bet that macy struthers had a hand in this .   we &apos;ll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips ! 
look .   look at that .   bert schnick can see .   why .  .  . he &apos;s .  .  . dancing . 
betty ,  it &apos;s imperative we get janet out of flavors &apos; fast fingers and brad out of that hell - hole before they both disappear forever .  if only i could place that name  -  -  mckinley ? 
president ?   past presidents !  betty ,  this is beginning to add up . 
i &apos;m not going ,  janet . 
some people do it for compassion
i &apos;ve took as much of you as any man can you &apos;ve lost your heart
poor brad . 
i need some
i want to see brad . 
you are the most desirable creature that ever walked . 
f for .  .  . 
criminal
hi !   macy struthers  -  -  co - host on the f .  f .  show . 
nice technique there .  .  .    .  .  . cammi . 
you picked him up and you fucked him ,  didn &apos;t you ,  bitch ? 
don &apos;t bother him with that .  we got to get going . 
really ?  because i don &apos;t know ,  i was thinking that  -  - 
why are you being so defensive ? 
miles . 
how &apos;s the trip ? 
and .  .  .  they &apos;re passing .  conundrum &apos;s passing .  he said they really liked it .  they really wanted to do it ,  but they just couldn &apos;t figure out how to market it .  he said it was a tough call . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  miles .  we did all we could .  you &apos;ve been a real trooper .   tell him i &apos;ll call back . 
my condolences . 
they &apos;re from both of us . 
you look fabulous ,  mrs .  raymond . 
oh yeah ?  we &apos;re just over in buellton .  windmill inn . 
how you doin &apos; tonight ,  beautiful ? 
i &apos;m thinking about the duck breast . 
come on .  you &apos;re fucking hungover . 
and ? 
how about the new ending ?  did you like that ? 
well ,  i say fuck that .  you need to get your joint worked on ,  that &apos;s what you need . 
you know what ?  let &apos;s take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first . 
yeah ,  but how are they making the salmon ?  poached with a yogurt - dill sauce ?  teriyaki ?  curry ? 
christine &apos;s dad  -  -  he &apos;s been talking about bringing me into his property business .  showing me the ropes .  and that &apos;s something ,  considering how long it took him to get over i &apos;m not armenian .  so i &apos;m thinking about it .  but i don &apos;t know ,  might get a little incestuous .  but mike does pretty well .  a lot of high - end commercial stuff . 
oh ,  yeah .  that &apos;s maya . 
have you no shame ? 
victoria and i used to like this view .   once we had a picnic here and drank a  &apos;95 opus one .  with smoked salmon and artichokes ,  but we didn &apos;t care . 
what do you think ? 
she called maya ,  who &apos;s not working tonight ,  so we &apos;re all going out . 
so what should i wear ? 
where is stephanie ? 
what ? 
look who &apos;s talking .  you &apos;ve been there . 
this is totally different .  i &apos;m talking about avoiding what you &apos;re talking about .  that &apos;s the distinction .  i have not made the commitment yet .  i am not married .  i have not said the words .  in a few days ,  i might get married ,  and if i do ,  then i won &apos;t be doing stuff like this anymore .  otherwise ,  what &apos;s the whole point of getting married ? 
here &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .  we move up here ,  you and me ,  buy a vineyard .  you design your own wine; i &apos;ll handle the business side .  then you get inspired and write a new novel .  as for me ,  if an audition comes along ,  hell ,  la &apos;s two hours away .  not even . 
you said she was shallow .  yeah ,  and a nouveau riche . 
she likes you ,  man .  stephanie &apos;ll tell you . 
don &apos;t come over the top .  stay still . 
is it the money thing ? 
is an abattoir like a .  .  .  like a .  .  .  what is that ? 
we &apos;re going to have some fun .  remember fun ?  we &apos;re going to have some of it .  okay ? 
yo !  yo !  here &apos;s my boy !  here &apos;s my boy !  who &apos;s your daddy ,  boy ?  who is yo &apos; daddy ? 
so tell me everything .  details .  i like details . 
we gotta slow down .   i &apos;m so tired .  let &apos;s just get out of here . 
how about this one ?  we didn &apos;t hit this one . 
you ever actually been in there ,  miles ? 
let me use your phone . 
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ? 
what about that guy who wrote confederacy of dunces ?  he committed suicide before he got published ,  and look how famous he is . 
that &apos;s thoughtful . 
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s time to settle down .  one woman .  one house .  you know .  it &apos;s time . 
i bet you that chick is two tons of fun .  you know ,  the grateful type . 
please ,  miles ,  please . 
so what the fuck were you thinking ? 
yep .  quite a day . 
want me to drive ? 
come on ,  let me drive . 
i &apos;m having the salmon . 
it might be too late already .  what are you waiting for ? 
it &apos;s kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanie &apos;s house .  all those times you came into the restaurant .  it &apos;s like you &apos;re a real person now .  almost . 
yeah ,  weird .  but great . 
wow .  anyway ,  i think it &apos;s amazing you &apos;re getting it published .  really .  i know how hard it is .  just to write it even . 
he &apos;s an actor ,  so it can &apos;t be good . 
please believe me .  i was even on the verge of telling you last night ,  but .  .  . 
you know ,  i just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception .  and i &apos;ve been doing just fine . 
ken . 
since the last time we spoke ?  i don &apos;t know .  could be better .  could be worse . 
universally rejected .  strike three . 
seems like everyone &apos;s getting married .  a year ago it was all divorces .  now it &apos;s all weddings .  cyclical ,  i guess . 
oh .  huh .  well .  .  .   congratulations again ,  vicki .  that &apos;s wonderful news . 
what &apos;s the rule about getting up in the middle of the night ? 
no . 
listen bo .  this is very important .  everything people have written about in science books is going to change .  the history of the world &apos;s future is on the tv right now .  we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there .  .  .   for your children bo . 
explain ,  act crazy ? 
i cursed . 
it was very dark . 
morgan ,  be careful . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  what book is this ? 
chicken teriyaki . 
he was only a year and half old . 
he &apos;s been like that for awhile .  we need to get him some medicine . 
graham . 
tell me something morgan .  in that book of your ,  did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile ? 
what do you think about the idea that they don &apos;t like places near water ,  and we might be safe from them near a lake or something ? 
is anything missing ? 
see father ,  ray &apos;s truck swerved off the road and ah .  .  .  hit colleen and then a tree .  she was pinned between the two . 
well ,  kate ,  it was self - defense sure enough ,  but i think you &apos;d have to say i killed old murdo .  i think that &apos;s definitely the word . 
emmett . 
where are we ? 
hobart ,  what are you people doing here ? 
i &apos;m just meeting a guy here and moving on .  so far i haven &apos;t been able to find him . 
looks like those boys are headed south ,  so they weren &apos;t the same ones that jumped me .  which way you going ? 
i gotta stop by turley and meet a guy . 
south of here ,  past chimayo . 
then i guess this is where we part ways .  sorry . 
he acted bravely out there ,  hannah .  just bad luck his getting hit .  could have been any one of us . 
this a friend of yours ? 
get out of here ,  jake . 
now let &apos;s talk about you chaps . 
this is it ,  gents .  my ma told me to head south past that rock . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s working out real good . 
hello ,  cobb . 
i see you &apos;re prospering without me . 
good old paden .  i was hoping you &apos;d changed your mind about the job . 
i told you this was a sweet set - up . 
i &apos;m a great believer in doing nothing . 
i never could count on you to be reasonable .   don &apos;t force me to make an adjustment around here . 
you really are a gambler . 
where &apos;s the dog now ? 
we all know what happened .   in a fit of jealous rage you killed simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you . 
we have a daughter together .   i just don &apos;t want to see viktor get hurt . 
christ  -  -   elaine ,  i know how it looks but .  .  .    .  .  .  it would mean a lot to viktor if you &apos;d go with him to the oscars .  if you won &apos;t do it for him ,  please do it for me . 
no !   you will not give in to that blackmailing bitch ! 
god ,  viktor .   why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ? 
 -  -  what &apos;s wrong with that ? 
it &apos;s the truth .   those 17 superstars are our insurance policy .   we can &apos;t open  -  -  can &apos;t make a profit without them . 
 -  -  it &apos;s called a projector . 
viktor ,  it &apos;s my studio . 
really ? 
yes ,  you do .  .  .   anyway ,  tonight was a good start . 
 .  .  .  simone . 
elaine ,  it &apos;s wednesday . 
 -  -  she already is .   simone &apos;s not coming over ,  elaine .   not tonight ,  not ever .   i want you back ,  elaine . 
this is crazy .   who am i fooling ?  i can &apos;t compete with simone .   what woman can ? 
but you don &apos;t understand .   she &apos;ll always be there  -  -  at some party ,  on some magazine cover ,  some song on the radio ,  up on some screen . 
of course she will .   her public will demand it . 
where are you ? 
i know it &apos;s embarrassing to admit it ,  mom ,  but when i think about it  -  -  honestly ,  i haven &apos;t .   i mean ,  it feels like i have .   i know more about her than members of my own family .   she &apos;s even in my dreams .  but i realized ,  going back through my diary ,  they were all tv appearances ,  near misses at parties ,  second - hand rumor ,  gossip on the internet .   i &apos;ve never actually seen simone up close ,  touched her ,  been in her physical presence .   have you ? 
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s doing this  -  -  taking advantage of him this way .  it &apos;s cruel . 
thank god for you ,  faith .   i know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand - in .   you don &apos;t know what a service you &apos;re performing for simone  -  -  shielding her from those animals . 
what i do to simone ? 
simone ? 
 -  -  simone ,  the question on everyone &apos;s mind is simply .  .  .   &quot; why ?  &quot; 
with everything that was going on in my life ,  i just needed to drop out of sight for a while  -  -  i needed time .   viktor bought me that time .   i owe him so much . 
that &apos;s true .   i can reveal that i am considering a career in politics . 
and still the connection was undeniable .   i haven &apos;t read  &quot; eternity forever &quot;  but i know it &apos;s brilliant .   and i know i would be perfect for clive . 
how will you do our love scenes ? 
absolutely not ! 
there &apos;s .  .  .  a wall between you  -  - 
you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions . 
 -  -  mr .  taransky ,  mr .  taransky .  .  .  thank god .   i &apos;ve been trying to see you ,  calling  -  -  your assistant wouldn &apos;t put me through .   i told her it was a matter of life and death .   i was afraid i wouldn &apos;t get to you in time  -  - 
it &apos;s me ,  mr .  taransky .   don &apos;t you recognize me ?   -  -  the future of film conference in san jose .  hank .  .  .  hank aleno .   i was keynote speaker .   you must remember my speech .  .  .   &quot; who needs humans ?  &quot; 
 -  -  eight years ago .   in that whole time ,  i never left my computer . 
 &quot; straw god &quot;  changed my life . 
hi ,  dad . 
dad ,  you know i don &apos;t like to get between you and mom but she &apos;s feeling down right now .   she broke up with kent . 
i love you ,  lainey . 
the old viktor taransky .   i liked you better before  -  -  before all this .   you were a loser ,  dad ,  but at least you had integrity .   i can &apos;t stand to see you like this  -  -  clinging to simone &apos;s coattails  -  -  it used to be about the work ,  and now it &apos;s all about her .   and then she &apos;s not even grateful enough to thank you . 
 -  -  plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court .   it &apos;s the best deal you &apos;re going to get . 
it &apos;s bogus .   you used an old library shot for the background . 
what now ,  sayer ? 
i traced her to a nursing home .   a young woman fitting simone &apos;s description dropped her off five years ago . 
i do ?   sure i do .   can we speak off the record ?   i &apos;m a fair man .   i &apos;m willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story . 
taransky isn &apos;t that good an actor .  no ,  they &apos;re taking special precautions .   some kind of new encryption . 
you could play the lead . 
see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood .   -  -  see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake ,  the scales have tipped in favor of the fake .    -  -  see that if the performance is genuine ,  it doesn &apos;t matter if the actor is real .   once a performance is committed to film ,  the blood and bones are gone anyway .   only the spirit ,  the illusion remains .  besides ,  what &apos;s real anymore ?  these days most actors have digital work done to them so it &apos;s a gray area . 
 -  - my god . 
are you calling me ? 
don &apos;t step in the horse manure . 
and cole ,  next time i won &apos;t be late for you . 
i draw people with smiles ,  dogs running ,  and rainbows .   they don &apos;t have meetings about rainbows . 
private kinney &apos;s wife is really sick  -  -  she has something called a brain anism .

a marked man gets wise and wants to come in .

 .  .  . a paternity suit ,  filed 1967 .  .  . 
you &apos;re trying to save sparazza ? 
i &apos;ll overlook what you &apos;ve done here today in light of what &apos;s taken place .  you &apos;ve been fully debriefed .  now i want you to return to d . c .  immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter .  i mean it .  it &apos;s closed . 
you got clicks ,  anything ? 
no question ,  no ,  you &apos;re right .  we gotta do what &apos;s good for us now . 
yeah ,  there &apos;s a pair &apos;a broads i &apos;m thinking might be good for this .

it &apos;s going around ain &apos;t it ?  mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch .   i think i accidentally shot and killed my boy today . 
true ? 
we gotta lay something out ,  strategy -  wise .  somethin &apos; tight .  y &apos;go in there ad - libbing ,  it &apos;s y &apos;ass . 
girl one of these fools has an fbi badge on him !  is this the one that was doing the inspection ? 
you have to give me your word you won &apos;t come in .   then i &apos;ll come out . 
they shouldn &apos;t let people like you into space . 
listen  -  - 
where &apos;s snow ?   did you call him ? 
i can &apos;t talk just now .   i &apos;m too tired . 
is there anybody else here ? 
i told you ,  try to stay calm .   you &apos;re supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch . 
kelvin ,  you awake ? 
stop equivocating !   unbelievable ,  how you equivocate !   you ,  the atheist ,  you &apos;re more dogmatic than any holy person i &apos;ve ever seen !   this is happening ,  kelvin .   wake up . 
they come when you sleep . 
what &apos;s wrong with you ?   we need your help . 
what are they ? 
not a very happy poem . 
you behave as though you want to fuck her . 
scared .   no ,  not scared .   wary .  like i was something to be .  .  .  her guard went up .   i was a threat .   now i know why .   she was afraid she &apos;d be seen .   that i would see her for the self - obsessed neurotic that she was .  i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal .  but that &apos;s the cycle ,  right ?   i knew a little more than she did ,  she knew a little more than her mother ,  and on and on .   i guess that &apos;s part of the reason why  -  - 
what happened to us ,  exactly ? 
sartorius wants to destroy it . 
what &apos;s wrong . 
what are you talking about ? 
you &apos;re the coward . 
rheya ,  i am not going back .   i &apos;m staying here with you . 
what do i have to do to stop it ? 
did you hear what gibarian said ?  i &apos;m not a human being .   i &apos;m an instrument .   i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what .   even if i remain passive .   that &apos;s when i drank the .  .  .   i was going mad .   it felt like there was no body underneath my skin .  there was something else .   an illusion .   but i could feel my heart beating ,  and i remembered you tested my blood .   is it like yours ? 
i think they help . 
we thought you &apos;d be alone .   we want to talk about .  .  . 
they are not autonomous individuals and they &apos;re not actual persons .  they are projections materializing from our minds ,  based on a given individual . 
it &apos;s terrific win . 
straight ahead . 
put it on my account ,  please . 
you put it back in the wrong place .  .  .  do you like renoir ? 
no dog . 
you could do better . 
it was nice having you  &quot; watch over me &quot;  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know you .  .  . 
you don &apos;t wash your clothes at the boulevard laundromat .  .  .  you don &apos;t pick up your kids from some crummy public school .  .  .  what is this ?   a fuckin &apos; joke ? 
what do you want to do ? 
you don &apos;t want to know . 
i don &apos;t know .   it wouldn &apos;t be very smart . 
it wouldn &apos;t work . 
how long you going away for ? 
we &apos;re not going to the game ,  are we mom ? 
mom ,  what &apos;s going to happen with you and dad ? 
tommy .  .  .  ! 
don &apos;t start .  .  .  the only reason is that the neighborhood &apos;s shi .  .  .    .  .  .  crummy .   i just don &apos;t like the idea of leaving you alone here at night . 
changing the sparks .   they showed it on tv .   what d &apos;you think ? 
i know you &apos;re her bodyguard .   did she buy it or did you ? 
it &apos;s not your fault .   mike ,  please get off the case . 
my wife talks to his wife about what shift i &apos;m gonna take ? 
i heard a lot .  .  .  anything you want to deny ,  mike ? 
at my house .  .  .  ! 
no one - seventeen ,  they &apos;ll fuck it up !   he told me not to tell anybody ,  to bring claire and come alone !   he won &apos;t wait ,  he knows i &apos;m two minutes away !   koontz ,  please ! 
hey mike ,  out of the bag into the bureau ,  huh .  .  .  how do you like it so far ? 
i asked for the man in charge .  .  . 
nice threads dad . 
you coming in ? 
yeah ,  take pity on the feeble minded . 
flash ,  get lost . 
you &apos;re so responsible it &apos;s disgusting .  but you &apos;re my only friend .  .  .  do you hate me ? 
come on ,  that &apos;s pure luck !   the guy was in the right place at the right time -  - 
i like enthusiasm .   that &apos;s why i use a lot of smart - ass kids .   not just  &apos;cause they work cheap . 
fill in the blank :   &quot; i blank elizabeth allan .  &quot; 
brrr .   it &apos;s colder than new hampshire in here . 
peter ? 
you were the last one to see thorkel .   in octavius &apos; hospital room . 
lieutenant ,  i &apos;ve triangulated recent bizarre events -  -  the bronx ,  jersey ,  brooklyn -  -  all rippling out from -  -   here .   the e . s . u .  science center .  octavius &apos; experiment seems to have opened a hole in space - time ,  drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding ,  electromagnetism and gravity -  - 
you sure about all this ? 
when i moved out ,  you swore up and down you wouldn &apos;t meddle -  - 
a match made in heaven . 
then the alumni reports came in -  -  fund - raising is down this year . 
creation ?  or its opposite ? 
need any more help ? 
kid ,  you were terrific .   max reiss ,  novelty acts .   was that judo or something ?   ah ,  skip it .   question is ,  can you do it again ? 
i see .   well ,  octavius won &apos;t get much further .  they &apos;ll catch him and .  .  .  put him away .   sad .   he might very well have the truth . 
don &apos;t let him kid you .  cagney couldn &apos;t have pulled a sweeter job .   all right ,  boys .  we were waiting in the depot in frankfurt ,  see ?  and there was an ammunition train coming through ,  the longest ammunition train you ever saw ,  see ?  so dunbar gets himself in the men &apos;s room ,  see ?  fixes himself a time bomb ,  busts open the window and just as the train moves out ,  lays the thing in there ,  see ?  so then ,  he comes out like nothing &apos;s happened and three minutes later you can hear it  -  -  boom !  broke every window in frankfurt .  it was gorgeous ! 
what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
i understand how you feel ,  cookie .  it &apos;s sort of rough  -  -  one american squealing on other americans .  then again ,  cookie  -  -  maybe that stoolie &apos;s not an american at all .  maybe he &apos;s a german the krauts planted in this barracks .  they do this type of thing .  just put an agent in with us  -  -  a trained specialist .  lots of loose information floating around a prison camp .  not just whether somebody wants to escape ,  but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed ,  and how our radar operates .  could be ,  couldn &apos;t it ? 
nice guy !  the krauts shoot manfredi and johnson last night and today he &apos;s out trading with them . 
here &apos;s the knife to do it with .  only make sure you got the right throat . 
brother ,  were we all wet about you ! 
come again ? 
ever try forty sleeping pills ? 
you have no idea how boring my life here is .  if it weren &apos;t for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape ,  i wouldn &apos;t know what to do .  i want to thank you for keeping me company .  i don &apos;t drink ,  i don &apos;t smoke ,  i don &apos;t read .  i hate music .  that only leaves good conversation .  it will be a shame to lose you . 
well ,  herr inspector !  how did you find the camp ?  crowded but gemuetlich ,  shall we say ? 
wisecrackers ?  where did he pick up his english ?  in a pretzel factory ? 
when you get going on those broads ,  think of me ! 
you can say that again ! 
it &apos;s chow ,  animal !  chow ! 
no ,  animal . 
wunderbar !  isn &apos;t he wunderbar ! 
equipoise !  equipoise !  what did i tell you ,  animal ? 
schnickelfritz !  i told you schnickelfritz !  why &apos;d you make me bet on equipoise ! 
that &apos;s what i wanna hear . 
sugar - lips shapiro !  frightening ,  ain &apos;t it ? 
grable ,  not gable ! 
you &apos;re wasting your time ,  duke .   outside ,  everybody !  let &apos;s get it over with . 
i don &apos;t know what your scheme is ,  but it sounds crazy . 
anybody call ? 
you heard that ,  sefton ? 
go on . 
what are we going to do with him ? 
you could use a new one yourself . 
and what &apos;s that crack supposed to mean ? 
three hundred and sixty - fifth bomb squadron ?  out of chelveston ? 
no .  i don &apos;t sprechen sie deutsch . 
say ,  schulz  -  -  you guys had machine gun practice last night ? 
hey ,  schulz  -  -  as long as you &apos;re going to move somebody in  -  -  how about a couple of those russian broads ? 
this is me in cincinnati . 
where is he now ? 
but that wasn &apos;t so long ago .  it couldn &apos;t have been more than .  .  . 
data ,  you &apos;re not thinking about using that thing are you ? 
the farpoint mission ?  data ,  that was seven years ago . 
sensors show five life signs aboard the station ,  captain . 
could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak ? 
can you locate them ? 
we &apos;re within range ,  sir . 
soran ? 
this clock ,  i gave this clock to bones . 
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s not .  it &apos;s better . 
antonia ? 
close to retirement ? 
an anti - matter discharge directly ahead=8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away . 
kirk here . 
we learn something new about ourselves every day .   now .  maybe i didn &apos;t make myself clear .  it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows . 
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t just leave it at that .  the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something .  as ship &apos;s counselor ,  it &apos;s my duty to - 
your family history is very important to you ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on .  in theory ,  a trilithium - based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti - matter weapon .  but they never found a way to stabilize it . 
sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago . 
as their cloak begins to engage ,  their shields will drop . 
response ? 
sir ,  the shields .  .  .  non -  responsive . 
i don &apos;t believe it .  .  . 
why don &apos;t we beam it up ? 
this is where the fun begins ,  saavik ! 
as before .  .  .  metallic mass .  .  .  verifying triminium photon tube .  .  .  no new data . 
there shouldn &apos;t< / u> be any .  only plant forms were built into the genesis matrix . 
 .            .  .  spock &apos;s tube .  .  . 
why ? 
the genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet .  but at the rate things are going now .  .  . 
whoever they are ,  they &apos;re getting closer . 
captain ,  what &apos;s happening ?  ! 
i &apos;m almost done ,  sir .  you &apos;ll be fully automated by the time we dock . 
eight weeks ,  sir .   but you don &apos;t have eight weeks so i &apos;ll do it for ya in two . 
how many more ? 
what happened .  .  .  ? 
sir ,  planet core readings unstable .  .  .  changing rapidly .  .  . 
we are clear and free to navigate . 
the planet vulcan .  in hailing distance ,  sir . 
would you look at that ? 
will you be able to handle that .  .  .  ? 
but ,  we had requested  -  -  we were hoping to take her back to genesis .  .  . 
maltz .  prisoners are at beam coordinates .  standby .  .  . 
give me what i want  -  -  and i &apos;ll consider it .  .  . 
ambassador ,  i  -  -  i had no idea you were here .  .  .   i think you know my crew .  .  . 
then you know how bravely your son met his death . 
share this with no one . 
i &apos;ll be in my quarters .  execute course to the federation boundary . 
twenty - two ,  eighty - three .  .  . 
uh  -  -  what are they ? 
say thank you . 
what do you want ?  damn it ,  why isn &apos;t there a girl here ?  you know this has nothing to do with age .  this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies . 
it never rains but when it pours  -  - 
lieutenant ,  you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the no - win scenario  -  - 
dr .  marcus .  .  .  good .  we &apos;re en route to you and should be there in three days . 
 .  .  .  can &apos;t read you .  .  .  repeat .  .  . 
 .  .  .  taking genesis away from us .  .  . 
 .  .  .  please help us ,  jim .  .  .  won &apos;t let them have .  .  .  without proper .  .  .  repeat .  .  .  on whose authority .  .  . 
well ,  don &apos;t have kittens .  genesis is going to work .  they &apos;ll remember  you in a wreath with newton ,  einstein ,  surak .  .  . 
par for the course .  .  .  you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ? 
i &apos;ve tried to warn you .  scientists are always pawns of the military  -  - 
are you sure these are the coordinates ? 
you &apos;re crazy  -  -   ! 
you lie !  on ceti alpha v there was life ,  a fair chance to  -  - 
it &apos;s the genesis wave ! 
not like this  -  -  no .  i haven &apos;t faced death ,  i cheated death .  i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity .  i know nothing . 
what are you< / u> looking at ? 
sir  -  -  our shields are dropping ! 
yours .  .  .  is .  .  .  the superior .  .  . 
thirty seconds .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know you .  but you .  i never forget a face .  mister chekov ,  isn &apos;t it ?   i never thought to see your face again . 
she &apos;s not responding .  .  . 
i &apos;m getting a voice message .  .  .  wait  .  .  .  short range band .  they say their chambers coil is shorting their comm system . 
midshipman ,  you &apos;re a tiger . 
every young boy &apos;s fancy .  i seem to remember it myself .   very well .  mr .  scott ,  are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise ? 
if he hadn &apos;t ,  we &apos;d be space by now . 
yes ,  spock . 
spock ,  this is kirk .  it &apos;s two hours .  are you about ready ? 
they destroyed the simulator room and you with it . 
that won &apos;t be necessary :  just take me to regula i . 
you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions . 
there are two possibilities ,  sir they are unwilling to respond ,  they are unable to respond . 
carol marcus  -  - 
what &apos;s she doing here ? 
not enough against their shields . 
scanners and sensors still inoperative .  there &apos;s no way to tell what &apos;s  inside the station . 
what is working around here ? 
i think we can guarantee she &apos;ll follow us ,  mr .  saavik .  remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego . 
sporadic energy readings port side ,  aft .  could be an impulse turn . 
well ,  mr .  saavik ,  are you going to stay with the sinking ship ? 
may i speak ,  sir ? 
cease fire .  look sharp . 
i &apos;ll be in my quarters if needed ,  but i would prefer .  .  . 
admiral on the bridge  -  - 
fire all phasers .  .  .  ! 
he &apos;s not what i expected ,  sir . 
certainly .  .  . 
as you wish ,  since you deem them of value .  but i cannot wait here to find them . 
and finally ,  they &apos;re not human beings ,  you know .  their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours  -  - 
well ,  so much for the tour of our humble plant .  i must say ,  professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive . 
i mean him< / u> ,  back at his post ,  like nothing happened .  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;d got the whole picture but he isn &apos;t exactly working on all thrusters . 
congratulations ,  jim .  i think you &apos;ve saved the earth . 
there are millions of other species on earth ,  doctor .  only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man . 
you &apos;re saying .  .  .  it is a compliment . 
the top of what ? 
my name ? 
can you protect us ? 
so you were at berkeley . 
you mean man .  .  . 
back to san francisco . 
flown .  .  .  and that &apos;s the last you &apos;ll see of them ? 
sorry ,  the time would have to be right now . 
wanna try it from the top ? 
 .  .  .  who are you ? 
well ,  i was close .  i knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later . 
well ,  why didn &apos;t you say so ?  why all the coy disguises ? 
 .  .  .  gone ?  ! 
it would be improper to refer to you as jim while you are in command ,  admiral .  .  .  also ,  i must apologize for my attire .   i seem to have misplaced my uniform . 
spock .  .  .  ? 
spock ,  could the humpback &apos;s answer to this call be simulated ? 
but we can &apos;t turn away !  is there no alternative ? 
ready to engage computer ,  admiral . 
come on ,  fellah  -  -  speak up ! 
well ,  for one thing ,  you haven &apos;t quite got the hang of it . 
it &apos;s her  -  -  from the institute .  if we play our cards right ,  we may learn when those whales are really leaving . 
status ? 
that &apos;s cutting it closer than you know .  what about team two ? 
no ,  admiral .  .  .  but is the human thing to do . 
estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed . 
hang on ,  sir .  .  .  nine point seven .  .  .  point eight .  .  .  breakaway threshold .  .  . 
what is our condition ? 
three - one - zero ,  aye ! 
10 seconds ,  sir ! 
we &apos;ll stick together till we get orientated .  bearing to the whales ? 
we &apos;re ready ,  sir .  i &apos;ve converted the dilithium sequencer to something less primitive .  and admiral  -  -  i &apos;ve replaced the klingon food packs .  they was givin &apos; me sour stomach . 
they &apos;re giving out .  de - crystallizing . 
admiral !  there be whales here ! 
stand by ,  sir .  miracle worker at work .  .  . 
you better get up there ,  sir .  we &apos;re having some power fall - off .  .  . 
even as the federation negotiated a peace treaty with us ,  kirk was secretly developing the genesis torpedo !  conceived by kirk &apos;s son and test detonated by the admiral himself !   the result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called  &quot; the genesis planet .  .  .  &quot;  a secret base from which to launch the .  annihilation of the klingon people !   we demand the extradition of kirk !  we demand justice ! 
yes ,  i noticed .  now suppose  -  -  just suppose  -  -  i could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick .  would that be worth something to you ,  eh ? 
hi . 
father .  .  .  ? 
chotto omachi nasarei .  namae wa nanto moosareruka na .   wait my son .  what is your name ? 
we were under the impression they were being held against their will . 
i don &apos;t like to leave questions unanswered . 
an apprentice for thirty years .   we &apos;ve noticed your people &apos;s mental discipline .  did that develop here ? 
i wonder if you &apos;re aware of the trust you endanger ,  jean - luc picard .  in my experience ,  it &apos;s unusual for .  .  . 
mother and son .  you arranged this .  .  .  ? 
i know why .   so people like us won &apos;t be afraid of you any more . 
but you &apos;ve never had adults telling you what to do all the time .  .  .  or bedtimes .  .  .  or having to eat food you don &apos;t like .  .  . 
do machines ever play ? 
won &apos;t he rust ? 
to many offlanders ,  what you have here would be more valuable than gold - pressed latinum .   and i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you . 
they all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production .  .  .  probably the result of the environmental anomalies here .  .  . 
you either need a new uniform or a new neck . 
 &apos;his nose should pant and his lip should curl .  .  .  &apos;
captain ,  i &apos;ve activated transport inhibitors around the village .  .  . 
your android has turned dangerously violent ,  captain .  .  .  considerable damage was done to my ship .  he must be destroyed . 
you &apos;re not finished here ? 
there are six hundred people down there .  we &apos;ll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions .   the son &apos;a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings .  .  . 
on earth ,  petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders .  warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire .  we can handle the son &apos;a ,  i &apos;m not worried about that .  .  . 
it doesn &apos;t matter where he is .  as soon as he realizes something is happening ,  he &apos;ll override my commands with one word at his com -  link .  .  . 
the injector performs perfectly in every simulation .  .  . 
separate the starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold .  .  .  see that picard joins them .  .  . 
we &apos;re about to lose communications with starfleet ,  captain . 
implants bothering you ? 
that &apos;s your expert opinion ? 
sir ,  they &apos;ve detonated an isolytic burst .  .  .  a subspace tear is forming .  .  . 
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey .  .  . 
deck five . 
my name is sojef ,  captain . 
i wish there was a way to bring them back home . 
i .  .  .  i must have slept through my alarm .  i &apos;m on my way .  .  . 
you need a haircut ,  commander . 
negative .  he &apos;s established a security field around the control room .  .  . 
you haven &apos;t done that in a long time .  .  . 
it says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the son &apos;a from procreating .  .  . 
this isn &apos;t one of the usual therapeutic postures .  .  . 
why don &apos;t you try sitting up ? 
this ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters .  .  .  are they all useless .  .  .  ? 
cochrane .  .  .  the inventor of warp drive ? 
but he &apos;s been dead for three hundred .  .  .   oh god .  .  .  we &apos;ve gone back in time again ,  haven &apos;t we ? 
he &apos;s stable .  .  .  for now .   but it would be better if we could contact .  .  .  our friends . 
you actually performed surgery .  .  .  ? 
yes .  .  . 
isn &apos;t it better like this .  .  .  ? 
your diagnostics are in error .  i need weapons . 
can you configure it ? 
mister data ,  i want to know the exact date and time .   give me a damage report on that missile silo . 
but now .  .  .  they are all one with the borg . 
no .  human beings do not have that luxury ,  and neither should i . 
this used to be the throttle valve assembly .   it controls the thrust of the engines .  it &apos;s been completely vaporized .  .  .  and without it ,  there &apos;s no way to launch the ship . 
yeah .  .  .  if i knew what it looked like .  there &apos;s probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this .  .  . 
solid rocket fuel at twenty - five thousand kilograms .  .  . 
ready to deploy the warp nacelles . 
the nacelles are charged .  .  .  nuclear warhead standing by .  we &apos;re ready to ignite the warp drive . 
are we on schedule ?  the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours .

where are you from most recently ? 
and what were you doing out at the missile silo ? 
take care of him .  he &apos;s a very special man . 
what ? 
lie .  that &apos;s one .  keep going . 
why ? 
hull integrity down to thirty percent .  .  . 
report ! 
someone .  .  .  ? 
captain ,  they &apos;re firing at a nuclear missile silo .  .  .  in central montana . 
i &apos;m going to perform surgery on a torpedo  -  you never know .  .  . 
bones ,  why don &apos;t you see what you can do ?  let them know we &apos;re not holding a grudge . 
what are you in for ,  if you don &apos;t mind me asking ? 
and what did they tell you ? 
louder ,  please .  we cannot hear you . 
captain ,  if they fire at us with our shields down  -  - 
from starfleet ? 
mr .  chekov ,  slow down .  take us forward ,  thrusters only ,  one quarter impulse power . 
they &apos;re preparing to fire . 
we &apos;d be delighted to accept your gracious invitation . 
when whoever it is makes their move ,  you won &apos;t be here to ask if he &apos;s the one . 
kronos ,  sir ? 
just the prototype . 
me ? 
i have personally vouched for you in this matter ,  captain . 
i don &apos;t believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy .  .  . 
what the  - 
captain ,  we can &apos;t see her ,  but she gives off heat .  .  . 
her own father .  .  .  ? 
any progress ? 
but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood . 
we can send a message to starfleet command  - 
praxis ? 
and if they &apos;re still in place ? 
they dinna fire on themselves .  and there were no other ships present . 
they you &apos;re talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction ,  mr .  spock . 
 -  could take weeks ,  sir . 
they &apos;re naturally wary ,  ma &apos;am .  we &apos;ve been at war a long time . 
sulu &apos;s giving us his position and telling us he &apos;s standing by .  .  . 
under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship .  we call it  &quot; plasma &quot;   -  i do not know the klingon name for it ,  but by any name it is merely ionized gas . 
brother .  i cannot move . 
indefinitely . 
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated .  remember ,  he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age .  he was engineered to skip thirty years of life .  but since the rna sequencing was never activated ,  his cellular structure has started to break down .  he &apos;s dying . 
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west .  .  .  that direction ,  sir . 
what do you imagine this is ? 
but so much is the same .  on a biological level he is .  .  .  and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do .  i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him . 
but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions . 
the b - 9 is like a slow child ,  sir .  and data ,  in his own way ,  has assumed the position of a parent or guardian .  i &apos;m afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences .  he &apos;ll be disappointed when the bi - 9 cannot meet those expectations . 
i would say he &apos;s been trained to resist telepathy .  what i could sense of his emotions were erratic ,  very hard to follow . 
captain ,  don &apos;t assume he &apos;s anything like you are .  you should resist the urge to think you know him . 
i &apos;m afraid that drink will have to wait ,  captain . 
deanna ,  on my mark . 
how long until he can fire ? 
admiral janeway .  good to see you . 
enterprise .  we are the reman warbird scimitar . 
it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest . 
captain .  i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear .  .  .   naked . 
i &apos;m picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system . 
to find the head ,  sir ? 
coordinate our attack with the valdore &apos;s tactical officer .  triangulate fire on any shield impacts . 
captain ,  the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock . 
sir  -  - 
it &apos;s working . 
report . 
i want to end the centuries of mistrust .  i want to be your ally ,  not your enemy .  as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas . 
romulan ale  -  -  i &apos;m surprised .  i can &apos;t stand it . 
intruder alert ! 
praetor .  .  . 
join us ,  commanders .   now what &apos;s the disposition of the fleet ? 
but surely .  .  . 
then perhaps you will enlight -  en us ? 
make any money ? 
what do you think of america ? 
contain it and get back to me . 
why did you let it get into a populated area ? 
i don &apos;t like it ,  george .  .  . 
we &apos;re growing very concerned back here .  there &apos;s no use pretending otherwise .  we &apos;re rapidly approaching a  &apos;condition red .  &apos; people are beginning to ask difficult questions . 
if i don &apos;t speak to mr .  shermin ,  i &apos;m hanging up . 
please . 
please .  .  . 
steering wheel .  .  . 
what ? 
minneapolis .  .  .  minneapolis .  .  . 
no gas . 
gas . 
no . 
what ? 
why are you going here ?  what is here ? 
i won &apos;t tell anybody if that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about .  i promise .  you &apos;ll keep .  .  . 
you &apos;ll keep the car .  i &apos;ll take a bus .  .  .   am i going up there with you .  .  .  in your ship .  .  .  up there ? 
yes . 
your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride . 
the captain .  .  . 
oh ,  that &apos;s terrible .  i &apos;m sorry .  was he a good friend ? 
sounds like your captain &apos;s going to get hell when he gets back home . 
what are you doing ? 
i told you goodbye .  why are you here ? 
where are you going ? 
why don &apos;t you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late ? 
what ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re pretty .  .  . 
the cook again ? 
would you put some of your singing in this for the baby ? 
well .  .  . 
jesus christ !  !  you crazy people .  .  . 
the five - fifty .  we already passed it .  but it &apos;ll take him way out of his way . 
aghh .  .  .  i &apos;m supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow . 
you get that ,  lyman ? 
jesus lyman ,  you &apos;re an ignorant fool . 
after i called in ,  i had a chance to sit down with the three locals .  they swear there &apos;s another one that didn &apos;t make the ship .  .  .  it might be alive . 
you married ,  major ? 
eh .  .  .  the store tells you to call when there &apos;s trouble ,  so they won &apos;t get sued .  .  .  but that shouldn &apos;t matter if there &apos;s a reward ,  right ? 
we can &apos;t let you do that . 
bullshit politics . 
we have nothing to talk about ,  lenny . 
he &apos;s no concern of mine ,  as long as you don &apos;t talk to him .   don &apos;t talk to anybody .   you understand ?   not with everything that &apos;s going on right now . 
i made my choice ,  lenny . 
he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .  leave him alone . 
well ,  i &apos;m certainly in the mood for a party . 
i said ,   &apos;yeah .   i &apos;d even do it for free .  &apos;
i feel like you &apos;re turning me into a vcr . 
you have to go .   i mean it . 
let it alone ,  lenny .   it &apos;ll take care of itself . 
he has his uses too . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
how did it happen ?   what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire ? 
i understand .   no ,  i &apos;m not . 
just what i &apos;ve read .   that the technology was developed for the feds ,  to replace the body wire .   and now it &apos;s gone black market .   so ,  uh ,  do i get the deck from you ? 
clips . 
talk to me about costs ,  here . 
you were lucky ,  max . 
faith ok ? 
sounds like tick &apos;s already celebrating . 
he &apos;s been cooked - off
mace .  .  .  no disrespect .  .  .  but you run this on the 11 o &apos;clock news ,  by midnight you got the biggest riot in history .   they &apos;ll see the fucking smoke from canada . 
wait a minute .   now i &apos;m remembering .  i killed iris too ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
was i a really busy guy ?   did i do tick too ? 
yeah ,  but how &apos;d it get to you ? 
tick .   not to dash your hopes ,  but i don &apos;t deal this kind of product ,  you know that .   i &apos;ll give you four for it ,  cause i &apos;ve gotta cut off the last bit .   and my customers want uncut . 
so lay it off to somebody else . 
show a little respect ,  nero .   the man was an important artist . 
i always do . 
it &apos;s alright .   he means it . 
commissioner strickland . 
just a couple of hours .   it &apos;ll be fun -  - 
hey ,  careful on the jacket .   this is armani .   you angry ? 
i thought we were friends . 
so am i .   just trying to get by . 
what &apos;s that ?   present from faith ? 
is this great fabric or what ? 
he knows what he &apos;s doing .   he &apos;s worn before .  .  .  a lot . 
if he could do what &apos;s on that tape ,  he &apos;s a sicko . 
how &apos;s zander ? 
whatup lenny ? 
think back about what she said .  exactly what she said . 
tell me . 
so ,  let &apos;s see ,  i &apos;ve got tran &apos;s goons ,  some squidhead psycho and the lapd all trying to kill me .   happy new year ,  lenny . 
there &apos;s a plus side ? 
kinda guy you can count on in a pinch . 
okay ,  we gotta get over there .   can you borrow a dress from cecile or something -  - 
but she was different .   there was a light in her eyes .  .  .  and she had this voice .   it was scary ,  all that pain coming out of that little body .  like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice .   i helped her .   and i promised her that i &apos;d always be there .  .  .  to protect her .   see ?   it &apos;s not about what &apos;s in her head .   it &apos;s what &apos;s in mine .   i can &apos;t let go of the promise .   it &apos;s .  .  .  like .  .  .  it &apos;s all i have left . 
got your ticket ? 
are we under arrest ? 
no .   i haven &apos;t noticed because i make my payments .   so ,  max pelcher ,  how &apos;s the p . i .  business ? 
but i mean isn &apos;t he faith &apos;s new -  -  
 .  .  . well ,  there was some friction :  i wanted to write up my work ,  educate the public ,  but koessler wouldn &apos;t allow it .  low felt koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers .  koessler had low reassigned to the pacific northwest ,  seattle .  you know when they say ,  stick it where the sun don &apos;t shine ?  that &apos;s where they stuck dick low . 
excuse me ,  a salesman gets done in his car and you call the fbi ? 
where &apos;s the nuevo american diner ? 
i hope that wasn &apos;t a joke because i can assure you ,  from personal experience ,  the fbi does not have a sense of humor . 
nine bodies in roswell ,  now this  -  -  it &apos;s getting a little hairy ,  huh ? 
you tell me . 
the room key &apos;s in the car .  on the seat . 
ligature strangulation ,  just like his victims .  a cord ,  nylon ,  you can tell by the indentation signature  -  -  again ,  like his victims .   look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in .  should have cut it off . 
i have 6 tons . 
what ? 
nada .  vague description ,  that &apos;s all .  fine - tooth - combed speck &apos;s car ,  the diner :  no fingerprints ,  no trace evidence . 
chuck ,  hello .   this is agent kulok .  she has a background in medical forensics . 
look ,  sorry .  don &apos;t say a word .   i know this is improper .  i &apos;ve been trying to speak with deputy director koessler .  i left a message .  i must speak with you before you go back to washington . 
why did you go to chicago ? 
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation . 
he &apos;s got you believing in zero now too . 
hawkins isn &apos;t the target ,  richard low &apos;s the target . 
agent kulok ,  that boy ,  as we speak ,  is in hawkins &apos; truck ,  probably still alive ,  in a dark refrigerated compartment ,  shivering in just a t -  shirt :  put yourself in his mind ,  freezing ,  terrified ,  wanting his mother .  put yourself in his mother &apos;s place ,  desperate ,  imagining the worst is happening as she pleads ,  back there at the rest stop ,  for someone ,  anyone ,  to listen to her .  this is not hypothetical ,  this is real .  it is happening now and you can do something about it . 
doesn &apos;t fit . 
don &apos;t even go there .  what &apos;s up ? 
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims :   &quot; i went live last month .  &quot; 
taking a stryker saw ,  cutting off the top of someone &apos;s cranium ,  pulling the brain out  -  -  what &apos;s that ,  a day in spring ? 
i was interested in two things :  computers and crime .  they sort of came together . 
i ever get like that ,  just take me out in back and shoot me . 
there are agency regulations about this . 
jesus . 
the tattoo ? 
you should have seen the store manager at parade of shoes .  she was inconsolable . 
there &apos;s the agency issue .  i think koessler may suspect something already .  we &apos;re not on the best footing with him as it is . 
you need time to think .  about the case ,  about you and me . 
probably .  i told him koessler had ordered the report ,  kept it secret . 
zero abducts victims all over the country ,  kills them ,  keeps them refrigerated for days ,  weeks ,  even months ,  then buries them hundreds ,  thousands of miles away .  karen sumpter was buried ,  washed up in a flood .  evans was buried .  when we get zero ,  we &apos;ll find boneyards all across the country . 
unlock these cuffs . 
mack must think zero has a police band . 
uncuff me .  what &apos;s wrong with you ?  don &apos;t you want to save the boy ? 
agent mackelway ? 
he couldn &apos;t break an egg with a hammer .  he still writing those crime porn books ? 
what was your weakness ,  sir ? 
there &apos;s someone out there ,  mack ,  i know ,  some man killing for the fun of it ,  sniffing human glue ,  without regard to age or sex ,  without predicable m . o .  someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies .  you have access ,  you can call up local authorities ,  check morgues ,  conduct interviews .  be my man . 
 &#93 fantasy time ,  girls ,  give it up ,  give it up . ]
 &#93 lionheart ,  what happened ? ]
if i owe ,  i will go . 
 &#93 if you wanted a good steak ,  you should have gone to omaha . ]
i see that .  washington to philadelphia to here .  philly &apos;s a nice station .  how many agents ? 
 &quot; attitude adjustment issues &quot;   -  -  what the fuck is that supposed to mean ? 
how far is amarillo ? 
deputy director koessler doesn &apos;t want zero .  all he cares about is low . 
he &apos;s a brilliant man .  brilliant enough to catch you . 
you ever go to the kelbo &apos;s ?  on pico ? 
i &apos;m mike . 
 .  .  . so i thought ,  what the hell ,  they make movies in l . a .  ,  not in michigan ,  so i moved here . 
hi . 
you haven &apos;t told then ,  huh ? 
no .  .  .  no .  .  .  the worst was when i went in for this after - school special and i &apos;m sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids .  i see they &apos;re all signed in for the same role as me .  .  . 
it &apos;s like ,  you looked at my tape .  you saw my picture .  why did you call me in ?  you knew i was twenty - four . 
let me just check on my boy . 
on the table . 
you &apos;re not allowed to hand me money ,  sir .  you &apos;ll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it . 
can i check my messages ?  i have a calling card . 
well ,  i should be getting .  .  . 
lorraine ? 
yeah ,  hold on . 
i really want to catch up with you ,  but i &apos;ve gotta take this call .  they &apos;re holding .  i &apos;ll talk with you when you get back in town .  bye . 
there &apos;s just something about being  &quot; goofy &quot;  .  any other disney character would be fine .  there &apos;s just this stigma associated with the character . 
i didn &apos;t mention her once today . 
how many strokes ? 
what &apos;s that guy &apos;s name ?  sue ? 
him ? 
thanks ,  man . 
sorry about what happened at the dresden .  i had no idea .  .  . 
i think i &apos;m gonna move back east . 
see ,  it &apos;s all how you look at it .  if your life sucks ,  then mine is god awful .  i mean ,  i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing .  you got in the union ,  you got an agent .  i thought if you could make it ,  maybe i could too .  .  . 
 .  .  . which means no one will get there  &apos;til ten . 
 .  .  . how can you compare them ?  tarantino totally bites everything from scorsese .  .  . 
 .  .  . it was six months ,  and she didn &apos;t dump .  .  . 
hi .  this is nikki .  leave a message .  
hi .  this is nikki .  leave a message .  
there you two are .  i walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray . 
listen to me ,  baby ,  there are going to be beautiful babies there . 
we &apos;re going to vegas . 
first let &apos;s see what happens if we play it cool . 
don &apos;t make fun ,  i think we can get some free shit if we don &apos;t fuck around . 
mikey &apos;s the big winner . 
what an asshole . 
that was so demeaning .  .  . 
baby ,  you did fine . 
oh .  .  .  a dorothy . 
wait .  .  .   she &apos;s crying .  i finish .  i hold up my finger like  &quot; wait a second &quot;  .  they sit in silence for ,  like ,  at least five minutes .  i look up and they all start clapping ,  and now they &apos;re all crying .  even the camera guy . 
i don &apos;t know .  the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on .  does that makes me some kind of fag ? 
she didn &apos;t like me ,  anyway . 
i just need some time .  .  . 
no .  doesn &apos;t that suck ? 
what time &apos;s this party tonight ? 
 .  .  . maybe .  i mean you gotta hide all the lights .  .  . 
what the fuck .  .  ? 
you were off your ass back there !  where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit ? 
it &apos;s not like that .  .  . 
 .  .  . shivering .  .  . 
you &apos;re money . 
definitely .  two days .  that &apos;s the industry standard .  .  . 
i &apos;m telling you .  wait three days .  .  . 
 .  .  . well ,  then ,  i guess we don &apos;t have to worry about him anymore . 
this is tom hagen; i &apos;m calling for don corleone ,  at his request . 
you heard about your father ? 
paulie &apos;s been a little sick all winter .  .  . he was home . 
you take care of paulie ? 
mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light .   then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell . 
we gotta fight sometime .   let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength . 
you look terrif on the floor ! 
you think we &apos;ll go for that last place ? 
no .  .  . how a man makes his living is none of my business .   but this proposition of yours is too risky .  all the people in my family lived well the last ten years ,  i won &apos;t risk that out of greed . 
all right ,  hollywood .  .  . now tell me about this hollywood pezzonovanta who won &apos;t let you work . 
you take care of your family ? 
it is johnny .   he came all the way from california to be at the wedding . 
no .   let the people enjoy him .   you see ?   he is a good godson . 
when does my daughter leave with her bridegroom ? 
what was this for ? 
and this ? 
i see you have your luca brasi . 
that is your birthright .  .  . but michael ,  use this car . 
hey america !   is she as rich as they say ? 
come on sonny ,  your father wouldn &apos;t want to hear this .   this is not a personal thing ,  this is business . 
will you give this letter to michael . 
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first .  understood ? 
i know now .   i &apos;ll make them call me don . 
my father sent luca brasi after them .   he tied the two capone men hand and foot ,  and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths .  then he took an ax ,  and chopped one man &apos;s feet off .  .  . 
if he &apos;s your brother ,  why does he have a different name ? 
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off . 
michael . 
would you like me better if i were a nun ? 
i can &apos;t .  .  . 
good .   she &apos;s been through it before .  me too .   you were too young to know about it .   you better wait outside; there &apos;re some things you shouldn &apos;t hear . 
all right ,  mikey .  .  . who do we have to hit ,  clemenza or paulie ? 
then wait ,  sonny .   talk to pop . 
that &apos;s not how pop would have played it . 
where are you going ? 
why don &apos;t you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up . 
do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless ?  do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world ? 
you straightened my brother out ? 
you &apos;d say if you mind ? 
i hope it wasn &apos;t cheap . 
he &apos;s drowning me ! 
princeton is like a fog ,  america &apos;s like a fog .   this is marge sherwood .  tom  -  -  sorry ,  what was it ? 
i like to sail ,  believe me ,  i love to sail !  instead i make boats and other people sail them . 
i met him in new york . 
good afternoon ! 
you &apos;re a dark horse ,  ripley .  engaged ? 
you &apos;re breaking my ribs ! 
i love the fact you brought shakespeare with you and no clothes .  ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night .  is that true ? 
it must be a deep secret ,  cause i don &apos;t know about it . 
look ,  tom ,  we &apos;ve got to go to a club and meet some friends of freddie &apos;s .  the best thing is  -  -  if you want to be a tourist  -  -  grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station . 
why are you asking all of a sudden ? 
ha . 
this is tom ripley .  freddie miles . 
marge - maintenance . 
hello ,  freddie ,  it &apos;s tom ,  tom ripley . 
hardly . 
tom . 
the thing with dickie  -  -  it &apos;s like the sun shines on you and it &apos;s glorious ,  then he forgets you and it &apos;s very very cold . 
well ,  one day i &apos;m invited skiing ,  the next day i &apos;m not ,  one day we &apos;re all one family ,  the next day he wants to be alone .  you tell me . 
is he here ?  are you with dickie ? 
he was there with someone .  so i suppose she must have dragged him  -  -  that &apos;s not fair .  i &apos;m going back to mongi .  i think dickie &apos;s coming home .   i &apos;m going to go home . 
did he kill freddie ? 
i tried again ,  waiting here ,  watching for him .  instead it &apos;s you .  whenever i look for dickie i find you .   what happened to your face ? 
dickie ? 
perhaps i shouldn &apos;t go either . 
look at me what ? 
marge ?  where are you going ? 
dickie ?  do you know dickie ? 
no ,  we &apos;re meeting another friend .  tom ripley . 
at christmas .  to cortina with freddie miles and  -  - 
now ?  i don &apos;t think so .  but i &apos;ve met him ,  of course ,  and we &apos;ve chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are .  freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r . 
don &apos;t worry .  really .  don &apos;t worry . 
so  -  -  are you travelling under r ? 
ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor greenleaf ,  il quale era l &apos;unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor miles . 
dove e stato il signor ripley da allora ? 
non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private !  
welcome to venice .  this place reeks ,  doesn &apos;t it ?  can you smell it ?  ugh .  sorry .  not the best way to spend your first day . 
no . 
but you &apos;re still tormented ,  you must be ,  you &apos;ve killed somebody .  .  . 
meredith logue .  you were kissing somebody .  looked like meredith . 
was it ?  did you speak to tom ? 
it &apos;s not a pattern ,  it &apos;s a coincidence .  there must be fifty hotels in san remo ,  there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day . 
no ,  i have and so has miss sherwood ,  ask her !  and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at  -  -  the goldoni !   -  -  tom was staying at the goldoni . 
how much to get a permit to carry ? 
you in nam ?  can &apos;t help but notice your jacket ? 
charles palantine .  the man you want to volunteer to help elect president . 
well ,  that &apos;s not exactly what the senator has proposed .  you might not want to canvass ,  but there is plenty more other work we need done :  office work ,  filing ,  poster hanging . 
that would have been quite a coincidence . 
i didn &apos;t mean that ,  travis .  just the part about the contradiction . 
the singer ? 
damn . 
this is sort of high class .  .  . 
well .  .  .  mostly .  .  . 
but .  .  .  betsy .  .  . 
i see where palantine got the nomination . 
no ,  no ,  please .  this fare &apos;s on me .  please . 
no ,  i didn &apos;t forget  &quot; sexy &quot;  . 
what taxi driver ? 
how long has he been there ? 
try holding the match like this . 
no ,  this is young  -  -  well ,  i &apos;m never sure how old black people are  -  -  but ,  anyway ,  he isn &apos;t old .  that &apos;s for sure . 
first she did her make - up .  you know ,  i hate it when they do that .  i mean she does the whole works ,  the mascara ,  the eye - shadow ,  the lipstick ,  the rouge .  .  .

sometimes it gets so i just don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do .  i get some real crazy ideas ,  you know ?  just go out and do somethin . 
look ,  a person does a certain thing and that &apos;s all there is to it .  it becomes what he is .  why fight it ?  what do you know ?  how long you been a hack ,  a couple months ?  you &apos;re like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in . 
could we change the subject ? 
don &apos;t stop .  .  .   do no stop . 
motor oil ? 
don &apos;t shoot me .  mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder .  .  .

but if you only went to one meeting ,  why does anyone care ?  besides ,  why should it even matter if you were a communist ? 
did you bring along something to read ? 
tell them pete .   tell them .  .  . 
dell ,  i can &apos;t write unless i &apos;m happy ,  and i can &apos;t be happy unless i &apos;m here  -  -  and with you .   this is me ,  delly .   pete appleton .  and i love you ! 
me too . 
you can all go home ,  now .   he &apos;s not going anywhere .

delly ,  shhhhhh .  .  . 
yes .  .  .  yes ,  i do . 
well ,  i &apos;d direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty - six of the document ,  and the name printed and signed there . 
all right ,  mr .  appleton .   that was what you knew then .   what do you know now ? 
do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth ,  the whole truth ,  and nothing but the truth ,  so help you god ? 
mother o &apos;god .  .  . 
yes . 
well ,  this place sorta reminds me of something . 
 &quot; it &apos;s a wonderful life ?  &quot; 
luke ,  you probably don &apos;t remember me ,  roscoe fitts ,  i &apos;m the grocer here in town . 
wait &apos;ll you see the inside ! 
i promised him a new uniform when we re - opened .   and you &apos;ll get one ,  too . 
forty - two was a lean year around here .   the war had just started .  .  .  you were gone less than a month .  .  .  and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall .   not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket ,  and a chicken &apos;s as good as money if you ask me .   at that time ,  it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures . 
but i .  .  . 
you bet . 
well ,  son ,  i wish i could &apos;ve shown you more ,  but this is all that &apos;s left .   just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago .  nineteen twenty - five ,  to be exact .  .  . 
nope .   can &apos;t .   we &apos;re through . 
here ,  one of mine . 
 .  .  .  sorry  &apos;bout that ,  but you do look familiar to me . 
don &apos;t say that .   there is no such thing as a blacklist .   now ,  are you gonna play ball ? 
the fbi can &apos;t arrest you ,  because you haven &apos;t done anything wrong . 
oh ,  i see .   but you &apos;re not luke .  you &apos;re peter appleton ,  the picture writer . 
that was beautiful . 
pete ,  there &apos;s time before the picture starts ,  you want to get some popcorn ? 
i suppose .   thanks . 
ernie cole here just got himself elected mayor .   lost both his boys in the war .   kenny at anzio and willie at normandy . 
said as much myself ,  doc .   can &apos;t place him ,  though .   to look at him ,  you &apos;d think the cheese slid off his cracker .   well ,  morning &apos;s half - over .   i &apos;m off . 
yes ? 
i &apos;ve been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes ,  but i couldn &apos;t convince myself to stop .  this  &apos;tilling of the soil &apos; can get a little compulsive ,  you know . 
it &apos;s a nice drive .   is that where you met mitch ? 
it &apos;s utilitarian ,  i &apos;ll say that for it . 
would you like some brandy ? 
and what had you done ? 
i don &apos;t understand . 
then what are you doing here in bodega bay ? 
i did . 
yes ,  i did . 
they haven &apos;t harmed anyone . 
are you coming to my party ? 
don &apos;t you like us ? 
don &apos;t you like bodega bay ? 
mitch ?   do .  .  .  do you think they &apos;ll be all right ?  in the trunk ?  can they breath ? 
lois ! 
no ,  it &apos;s lois ! 
i &apos;m looking for a man named mitchell brenner . 
and the white house ? 
the two kids ? 
i see .  how do i get down there ? 
daniels . 
are you sure ? 
thank you . 
why not ,  mrs .  bundy ? 
young woman cut herself . 
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once ,  sued me before i could bat an eyelash . 
i thought i saw your car .  what are you doing in town ? 
you did say birds ? 
seven o &apos;clock ,  same as usual . 
how long have you known her ? 
she was selling birds . 
forgive me .  i suppose i &apos;m just naturally curious about a girl like that .   she &apos;s very rich ,  isn &apos;t she ? 
we won &apos;t be here . 
i want to try for san francisco .  there are buildings there .  steel and concrete ! 
where &apos;s mitch ? 
would you ?  i &apos;d feel so much better . 
that &apos;s the last of it . 
 &apos;cause sometimes birds are attracted by light ,  you know .   sure is a peculiar thing . 
does this room look silly ? 
well ,  if there &apos;s anything else i can do ,  mitch .  .  . 
yes .  i don &apos;t think you should leave them in the hall ,  do you ? 
no ,  sir ,  those are .  .  .  redbirds . 
doesn &apos;t what make me .  .  .  ? 
i don &apos;t know you . 
how ? 
what are you ?  a policeman ? 
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical .  .  . 
didn &apos;t you see the lovebirds ? 
oh ,  no you don &apos;t ! 
but you were coming up anyway ,  remember ? 
with .  .  .  with annie ,  of course . 
did you really write a letter to me ?  or was that a lie ,  too ? 
i have several jobs . 
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch .   i &apos;m chairman of a group that &apos;s sending a little korean boy through school .  we plan how to raise funds and .  .  .  things like that .  
you &apos;ll think me very bold ,  sir . 
you look a little shaken . 
do you want some mustard with this ? 
i &apos;ll take cathy up to bed . 
and all the while ,  that sparrow was getting in his little messages .  birds of the world ,  unite ! 
i hadn &apos;t thought of that .   and then the swifts came . 
that was al on the phone .  he wants me to meet him out at the fawcett place .  says some detectives from santa rosa &apos;ll be there in a little while .   will you be all right here ? 
have we still got power ? 
hello ,  mrs .  macgruder ,  have you ever seen so many gulls ? 
certainly not .  oh ,  no .  certainly not .  this will be a full grown myna bird .  full grown . 
there we are ! 
yes ,  certainly .  
they &apos;re both perching birds ,  of course ,  but of quite different species .  the crow is brachyrhynchos .  the blackbird is cyanocephalus . 
how do you plan to do that ? 
makes a lot more sense than .  .  .  well ,  an attack . 
you asked to see me ,  ma &apos;am ? 
you have his promise ,  then ? 
save yourself .  master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned . 
i &apos;m cold as ice . 
he &apos;s not home . 
there &apos;s no standing between a fool and his folly .  if you must babble your news to him he &apos;s at the fisherman &apos;s tryst .  it &apos;s the inn at pennycuik .  you can use macfarlane &apos;s horse and gig to get there .  he &apos;ll welcome the ride back . 
but richardson ? 
wilmont used up the last spinal section . 
well  -  - 
i wouldn &apos;t do that ,  fettes .   i wouldn &apos;t report it . 
here is where you must watch closely ,  gentleman  -  -  closely  -  -  it is the very heart of the matter  -  - 
she &apos;s unconscious . 
i &apos;ve just been to see mrs .  marsh .  georgina is doing splendidly .   the incision has healed  -  -  clean and fine  -  -  but she doesn &apos;t seem to have any desire to walk . 
tosh !   fettes !   it &apos;s not their grief i &apos;m worrying about  -  -  i &apos;m talking of our own end  -  - 
not much danger here ,  ma &apos;am ,  i wouldn &apos;t think  -  -  right here in the heart of edinburgh . 
i will not have you use that name to me . 
afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be . 
you ?   why ?   since when have you become the protector of little children ? 
you &apos;re welcome to my little nest ,  joseph  -  -  is it not ?  that &apos;s right  -  -  you have something to say to  me  -  -  something very private . 
you and i should work together . 
no digging joseph .  the churchyards are too well guarded .  we will  &quot; burke &quot;  them , 
 &quot; the ruffian dogs ,  the hellish pair .   the villain burke ,  the meager hare  -  -  &quot; 
i don &apos;t understand the song .  tell me plain how they did it . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  doctor .   georgina &apos;s a good child  -  -  a brave child  -  -  you saw how she was during the operation  -  -  but if she can &apos;t move ,  she can &apos;t move . 
you &apos;re not going to gray . 
you &apos;ve been with gray again . 
it was one thing her dad rejected you .  but when she did you lost it . 
you think i &apos;m crazy . 
think maybe knives do ? 
fucking zombie . 
fuck .  me . 
you &apos;re him .  corvis . 
you &apos;re a friend of the guy who killed her ,  aren &apos;t you ?  you almost sound like him . 
this tree .  here &apos;s where it happened . 
 .  .  .  took everything i ever cared about .  left me with nothing . 
i wish i could hate him but i can &apos;t .  he said he &apos;d never hurt either of us ,  and i know it &apos;s true and .  .  .  i &apos;m going back . 
i thought we had an understanding .  i thought we understood that discretion is paramount . 
how about sign of a big black bird ? 
cause if you &apos;re losing your mind ,  i got a right to know . 
an accident ,  nathan . 
what &apos;s with your friend there ? 
why are there so many ? 
you should see it ,  professor barnhardt !  you should go out and see it for yourself ! 
you wrote this ? 
in the hands of a mature civilization ,  these would not be considered weapons of aggression .  but in the hands of your people -  -   we &apos;ve observed your aggressive tendencies ,  and we don &apos;t trust you with such power . 
such power exists ? 
sure .  right near where my mother works . 
i thought that was only for bombs . 
mr .  carpenter  -  -  what does velocity mean ? 
i &apos;ve got some money .  my mother gave me two dollars . 
you must have come a long way . 
perhaps you &apos;d rather discuss it personally with the president -  - 
now that you understand the situation more clearly ,  perhaps you &apos;d like to discuss the matter with the president
before making any decisions ,  i think i should get out among your people  -  -  become familiar with the basis for these strange ,  unreasoning attitudes . 
it was a wonderful day . 
he &apos;s a fine boy ,  mrs .  benson . 
mr .  carpenter ,  i -  -   goodnight . 
i saw bobby this morning before he went to school -  - 
i want to know what he told you last night . 
you hold great hope for this meeting . 
no ,  wait a minute  -  -  there &apos;s someone else . 
hello . 
is it worth anything ? 
but i suppose you know the answer . 
okay  -  -  book him and get him fixed up .   looks like everybody &apos;s goin &apos; nuts . 
yeah ,  you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad ,  huh ? 
salt sticks to the bottom of his feet . 
we &apos;ve been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time . 
shut up ! 
two down and two to go . 
we still going ? 
you can &apos;t kill me ,  star . 
or a vampire . 
get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart . 
he &apos;s telling the truth !   aren &apos;t you ,  michael ? 
just so you know :   if you try to stop us ,  or vamp - out in any way ,  i &apos;ll stake you without thinking twice about it . 
max ?   you men we &apos;re having company again ? 
oh .  .  .  i was just .  .  .  having a look at your truck .   what &apos;s all that wood in there for ? 
are we havin &apos; fun or what ? 
i know it was them ,  star .   i &apos;m sure of it .   he was working in the yard  -  -  hammering something .   the yard was big with lots of grass .   there was no boardwalk and no ocean .   she was bringing him something cold to drink .  .  .  and had red hair .   i was there ,  too .   and a dog  -  -  but i don &apos;t know its name .   i was running and the dog was chasing me .  then i turned around and chased the dog .   they were watching me .  drinking their cold drinks and laughing .   and i was laughing ,  too . 
you like michael . 
michael ,  will you do me a favor this evening ?   will you stay home with sam tonight ?   i &apos;m meeting max for dinner after work . 
 -  -  if there &apos;s a girl ,  we could talk about her . 
mom ,  there &apos;s an amusement park right on the beach ! 
lights out ,  sam . 
nanook ,  stop breathin &apos; on me . 
oh ,  no .   now what ? 
there &apos;s nothing wrong with max .   i don &apos;t know why you don &apos;t  -  - 
you &apos;ve got a generous nature .   i like that in a person .   my name is max . 
so what can i help you find tonight ,  lucy ?   we &apos;ve got it all .   best selection in santa carla . 
yeah .   runaways ,  mostly .   they come from all over .   attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean .   lucy .  .  .  listen i know i have no right to ask you this .  .  .  but don &apos;t look for another job just yet .  .  .  i mean besides being the best employee i have .  .  .  i think you &apos;re cute . 
is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner ? 
this looks terrific ,  lucy . 
max !   what &apos;s wrong ? 
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change . 
why not ? 
i know ,  i &apos;ve felt it .  .  . 
then what &apos;s the rush ?   you &apos;re chasing that girl ,  why don &apos;t you just admit it ?   i &apos;m at the mercy of your sex glands ! 
did you spill something ? 
michael ? 
who are you calling ? 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
clark ,  did you notice anything strange about that dog ?   just anything at all ?   any little thing ? 
what the hell you looking at me like that for ? 
was that dog ,  the norwegian dog ? 
couldn &apos;t make much of it myself . 
what you doin &apos; ? 
 .  .  .  can &apos;t you see .  .  .  ?   if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth .  nothing could stop it !   nothing ! 
fuchs .  .  .  ?   no ,  it &apos;s not fuchs .  .  .  you must let me back in .  .  .  i won &apos;t harm anyone .  .  .  i promise .  .  . 
why didn &apos;t it imitate fuchs ?   isn &apos;t that its number  -  -  to get more recruits . 
what &apos;s happening ? 
torch it over there ! 
torch them !  ! 
macready ! 
we should have jumped his ass . 
spaceship of some kind . 
i guess you &apos;re okay . 
gotta be from the norwegian camp . 
get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles . 
let &apos;s rush him .   he &apos;s not going to blow us all up . 
sanchez .  .  .  ?   hey ,  who .  .  . 
we &apos;ve got to find fuchs .   when we find him  -  -  we kill him . 
you know damn well what we both make of it . 
somebody else sure as hell thought so . 
yeah ! 
now how did you get hurt ? 
ah .  .  .  no . 
there &apos;s a place that might help .  .  .  we could try going there . 
right up your alley ,  i would think .  you are from the past ,  yes ? 
please ,  we need your help .   the morlocks have taken  -  - 
send him away . 
aren &apos;t you a plucky little  -  -   ? 
vox ? 
they raise them like cattle .  .  .  feed them until they &apos;re ready and then hunt them . 
nothing to do ,  i &apos;m afraid .   i &apos;m just a librarian after all .   wasn &apos;t exactly made for all this swashbuckling .   very byronic end ,  though .   i appreciate that .   do you know byron ? 
what &apos;s your name ? 
but this is barbaric !   have you completely lost all sense of  -  - 
that was a foolish thing to do . 
but you &apos;ve earned a reward for your valor .   i think you should become .  you &apos;ll like it here .   once you get used to the darkness . 
how do you keep the water temperature stable ? 
the 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations ,  increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies .   can i tell you more ? 
admiration ?   my my . 
alex ,  what is it ? 
alex .  .  .  ?  ! 
you &apos;re so pale .  .  .  i hope you &apos;re not coming down with something . 
i was not . 
i don &apos;t .   i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see . 
i know that  -  - 
david .  .  .  i appreciate your concern ,  i do .   but i ask you to have faith in me .   just for a little while longer .   i &apos;m working on something now .   something .  .  .  extraordinary . 
couldn &apos;t help but overhearing .   two fine young people starting out on the road of life .   i wish you the very best . 
we don &apos;t have anything like this .  or the machine where kalen found you .   and i doubt they do beyond the valley .  .  .  now where do you come from ? 
i &apos;m going to sit with kalen .   keep the fire burning if you can . 
don &apos;t torture me  -  -  do you have it ? 
he said he traveled for two months . 
good morning ,  alexander .   feeling up to some work ? 
we have to go after them ,  find where  -  -   ! 
what do you mean ?  ! 
sir ,  if i may  -  - 
relax . 
long live the organization for the organized ! 
this is really happening ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
jackie ,  go play in the snow . 
the jacket .  that &apos;s what they call it ,  right ? 
 &#93 beat] you bled to death . 
alpine grove still exists .  i looked it up on the net .  we should go there and see if there &apos;s still anyone around who might have known what happened to you . 
i don &apos;t believe a thing she just said . 
how long do we have ? 
what ?  what are you thinking ? 
i don &apos;t know .  maybe that &apos;s because this whole thing is a dream .  how can you have a street with no cars on it ? 
of course he will .   &#93 beat] what day of the week is it ? 
where are we going ? 
what &apos;s happening to me ?  why am i getting so much weaker ? 
you gotta stop thinking like that . 
it &apos;s ok .  it &apos;s ok .  relax .  it &apos;s just a cut .  we can get it fixed .  but we need to get you to the hospital now .  how &apos;d you get that ? 
you were convicted of the crime . 
you should be careful .  you could be killed if they found you out here . 
ok fine .  tell me about it .  tell me about the future .  2004 .  what does it look like ? 
how do you know about eugene ? 
who .  .  . who kills me ? 
what were you talking about the other day ? 
i know you need one when it &apos;s really cold . 
 &apos;cause lorenson &apos;s got her claws in it now .  when she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me .  women ! 
because in my life ,  it wouldn &apos;t make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he &apos;s from and a place where he &apos;s going to .  it &apos;d be too simple .  i probably wouldn &apos;t know how to handle a situation like that . 
no ,  you won &apos;t .  you &apos;ll die of cold out there and then i &apos;ll have to feel guilty .  and i &apos;ve already got more guilt than i know what to do with .   &#93 beat] do you want something to drink ? 
you like it ? 
this is a great song . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
on what ? 
who &apos;s the nut ? 
we &apos;re both fine . 
no ! 
alright . 
we don &apos;t have a whole lotta choice ,  do we ?   i can &apos;t figure out if they &apos;re real smart or just really ,  really lucky . 
did you get married real young ? 
tell me . 
you &apos;re kinda the best thing that &apos;s happened to me in a long time . 
jimmy !   hello ,  stranger .   what in the world are you doin &apos; here ? 
good answer .   same goes double for me . 
louise !   where are you ?   are you alright ?   honey .  .  . 
i have a savings account with about sixty - seven hundred dollars in it .  now i know you won &apos;t be able to get it out ,  but i &apos;m good for it .   i need that money .   can you wire me the sixty - seven hundred dollars and i &apos;ll pay you back ?   please ,  i &apos;m desperate . 
stop it !   stop it ,  jimmy ,  or i &apos;ll leave right now .   i &apos;m not kiddin &apos; ! 
so whaddya think .   i mean .  .  .  i could .  .  .  uh .  .  .  get a job .   of some kind .   i mean you &apos;ve been tellin &apos; me that for years ,  right ? 
i &apos;m the one .  .  .  i never made it work .  i just .  .  .  it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love you .   it &apos;s not that .   i just never thought i &apos;d be thirty - six years old and i never thought .  .  .  i don &apos;t know what i thought .   what do you want ,  darlin &apos; .   what do you want me to do . 
i don &apos;t know .   warm stuff ,  i guess .  it &apos;s the mountains .   i guess it gets cold at night .   i &apos;m just gonna bring everything . 
i &apos;ll never make it .  .  .  can &apos;t we stop just for a few minutes .  .  . 
so ,  jimmy still hasn &apos;t called yet ? 
thelma ,  i &apos;m gonna hit the little girls &apos; room ,  and then we gotta hit the road . 
if you weren &apos;t so concerned with having a good time ,  we wouldn &apos;t be here right now . 
will i be ? 
i just don &apos;t see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride .   did you see his butt ?   darryl doesn &apos;t have a cute butt .   you could park a car in the shadow of his ass . 
i know ,  louise ,  but we &apos;re running for our lives !   don &apos;t you think you could make an exception just this once ?  !   i mean ,  look at the map .  the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas ! 
that &apos;s puttin &apos; it mildly . 
so what are you gonna tell him ? 
what happened to your hair ? 
for the first time in my life ,  i wish this car wasn &apos;t green . 
fill her up .   there &apos;s a phone right over there . 
how &apos;d they find out we &apos;re going to mexico ,  thelma ,  how they know that ? 
can i ask you kind of a weird question ? 
oh ,  christ .   i hate this guy . 
what ? 
what ?  !   what about him ?  ! 
what ? 
you &apos;re not gonna make some deal with that guy ,  are you ?   i mean ,  i just wanna know . 
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive . 
shit ! 
what ?  !   what d &apos;you think ?  ! 
i &apos;m not apologizing for shit ! 
well you &apos;re a writer ,  and a lot of writers are gay .  look at truman capote . 
give me a break .  remember five years ago ,  when your kidneys failed ?  if you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match ?  what are the odds of that ,  one in a million ? 
so that was it ?  one bump in the road and you gave up ? 
you &apos;re kidding ?  what did they say ? 
my mary  -  -  she &apos;s not in japan ,  she &apos;s single ,  and she &apos;s got no rugrats .  she does have a little gambling problem ,  she plays the football cards a bit too much ,  but she &apos;s a babe ,  a surgeon babe ! 
oh god ,  i &apos;m fucking nervous .  i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready for this ,  man . 
bob ,  do you remember mary ?

so ,  dom tells me you &apos;re looking for some lady - friend you knew in high school . 
all you want is a phone number ? 
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case ? 
sure she is .  that &apos;s why she got an unlisted number and you haven &apos;t heard squat from her in a dozen years .  oh you &apos;re good ,  ted .  you &apos;re a real piece of work . 
look ,  uh ,  i &apos;ve been thinking about everything you told me .

yeah well fuck you !  you just can &apos;t stand the fact that it was my turn . 
among others .

i see where you &apos;re going .

and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev &apos;s ears to the top circles of my government

adlai &apos;s too weak !  we have to convince jack to pull him ,  get mccloy in there . 
zorin will eat him alive !

you &apos;d worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support . 
how does a man get to a place where he can say ,   &apos;throw those lives away ,  &apos; so easily ? 
it &apos;s a goddman trial balloon .  trial is the operative word ,  here . 
you must think i &apos;m blind and stupid .  i &apos;ve already gotten the birds and bees from bobby .  the president doesn &apos;t have to double - barrel me .

the owl told him about leo .  that &apos;s incredible .  i guess we just broke the back of this investigation ,  didn &apos;t we ?  evidence doesn &apos;t get any harder than that  -  -  not for my money .  is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court ? 
i can &apos;t do that ,   it &apos;s a rolex . 
it &apos;s not real . 
you &apos;re right about the old man .  his power &apos;s long dried up .  he &apos;s supposed to be a medicine man but he won &apos;t go see the people .  he says we changed ,  and we don &apos;t listen .  well ,  he don &apos;t go out and talk no more .  i haven &apos;t had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar ,  and this hoss is gettin &apos; watered .

he tried to kill him twice before .  that &apos;s a good place to start don &apos;t ya think ?  leo was on the other side ,  wasn &apos;t he ? 
a fugitive alert for a murder suspect .  before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine . 
i desecrated it ? 
with an indian representative out there ,  we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a cointelpro ,  selective operations unit ,  and it &apos;ll be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people &apos;s trust and maybe  -  - 
what ya want ? 
washington sent ya .  i know that . 
not for long ,  richard .  you got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation ,  and you didn &apos;t deliver .

that &apos;s what we wanted you to think .  the fact is ,  hauser volunteered to become doug quaid .  it was the only way to fool the psychics . 
the guy &apos;s a fucking asshole . 
lori says he can &apos;t remember jack shit ! 
bob ? 
i &apos;m with an very important client .

you sure you don &apos;t wanna .  .  .  ?   for old time &apos;s sake .   if you don &apos;t trust me ,  you can tie me up . 
i suppose you &apos;re not here either . 
to be perfectly honest with you ,  doug ,  if outer space is your thing ,  i think you &apos;d be much happier  with one of our saturn cruises . everybody raves about  &apos;em . 
let &apos;s see .  .  . the basic mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety - nine credits .   that &apos;s for two full weeks of memories ,  complete in every detail .    -  - a longer trip &apos;ll run you a little more ,  cause you need a deeper implant . 
first of all ,  doug ,  when you go rekall ,  you get nothing but first class memories :  private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the hilton; plus all the major sights :   mount pyramid ,  the grand canals ,  and of course .  .  .   venusville . 
as real as any memory in your head . 
i give up .

i think they shoot right outta its mouth ,  hook you ,  and pull you right in .   good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else . 
you didn &apos;t cook breakfast ? 
why don &apos;t his parents ever take him to vegas with them ?

eddie  -  -  it &apos;s art esparza !

just which constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle pcp ?

johnnie ,  i can &apos;t tell you ,  honey .  is there anyway we can get on the road tonight ?  we &apos;ve got to find them kids . 
heard grandpa santos and grandmama talkin &apos; . 
why we sittin &apos; here ,  mama ? 
i &apos;m scared ,  mama . 
case daddy don &apos;t like me .  what if he don &apos;t like that i don &apos;t got his color hair . 
well ,  i was thinkin &apos; about smokin &apos; actually .  .  .  my mama smokes marlboros now ,  used to be she smoked kools ?  i stole  &apos;em from her beginnin &apos; in about sixth grade .  when i got old enough to buy my own ,  i bought those .  now i &apos;ve just about settled on mores ,  as you probably noticed ?  they &apos;re longer . 
in a fire ,  as i recall . 
uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch ,  you know ?  where i was makin &apos; a jelly and banana sandwich ?  i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin &apos; that night with vicki and cherry ann ,  the desoto sisters .  uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home ,  cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter . 
that don &apos;t seem fair . 
actin &apos; funny how ? 
sorry ,  baby .  .  .  when &apos;s the first time you done it with a girl who wasn &apos;t hookin &apos; ? 
she looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm  -  told me her name was irma . 
she just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air .  i slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it . 
i suppose so .  she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung ,  but i don &apos;t figure she counted on us takin &apos; off together like this .  .  .  i guess this means you &apos;re breakin &apos; parole ,  then ? 
what it says on the bumper sticker up front .  on that pickup . 
almost .  i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat . 
how about that one ?  the host of the old south hotel . 
huh ? 
i ain &apos;t never met anyone come close to you ,  sugar . 
talkin &apos;s good .  long as you got the other ?  i &apos;m a big believer in talkin &apos; ,  case you ain &apos;t noticed . 
you think so ,  baby ?  does my talkin &apos; bother you ,  honey ? 
sometimes dreams just don &apos;t mean nothin &apos; .  .  .  stuff comes into your mind and you don &apos;t have no control over ,  you know ?  anyways ,  dreams ain &apos;t no odder than real life .  sometimes not by half . 
i ain &apos;t so sure it &apos;s a great idea ,  but that &apos;s up to you .  just don &apos;t tell her where we are . 
you want to stick around here ,  sailor ?  see if we can get some work ? 
there &apos;s worse places ,  honey . 
let &apos;s get ahold a &apos; her quick . 
darlin &apos; ,  i still ain &apos;t feelin &apos; so well .  i &apos;m goin &apos; to bed . 
sailor ?  you know what ? 
really ,  sailor ,  it ain &apos;t nothin &apos; against you .  i love you . 
i know .  just i &apos;m sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin &apos; ,  and this don &apos;t help soothe me . 
can &apos;t tell yet .  where &apos;d you go ? 
i mean tomorrow . 
who says i &apos;m smart ?  you up to somethin &apos; with bobby peru ,  sailor ? 
you must be my son . 
what &apos;re you talkin &apos; about ?  that &apos;s your son in there . 
if you mean sailor ,  mama ,  yes i am . 
no ,  mama ,  i &apos;m in mexico ,  and we &apos;re about to get on an airplane to argentina ! 
mama ,  i &apos;m hangin &apos; up this phone now . 
what do you want me to do about it ? 
simple ?  kill him ?  how ? 
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt ? 
explain it .  .  .  i told you . 
shoot him ?  like with a gun ? 
where ?  in the leg ? 
shoot sailor in the head with a gun .  .  .  now i &apos;m beginning to get it .  .  .  you want me to shoot sailor in the head with a gun . 
wrong !  it &apos;s much better to blow a hole in the back of the head .  .  .  right toward the bridge of the nose .  .  .  lots and lots of irreparable damage . 
you give me your permission to kill johnnie farragut . 
shhhh .  .  .  it &apos;s all right .  .  .  also ,  i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed . 
that &apos;s just another part of the price to pay . 
what ?  .  .  . 
oh .  .  .  look at this .  .  .  what do you want ,  snakeskin ? 
he &apos;s fine .  he &apos;s narrating . 
hey .  what are you guys doing here ? 
no offense ,  professor tripp ,  but you look sorta crappy . 
i thought you were mrs .  gaskell &apos;s hobby ,  tripp . 
well ,  i &apos;m going to read it anyway . 
christ ,  crabs ,  what do you expect me to do ?  the kid &apos;s practically in a coma . 
listen ,  hannah ,  i &apos;m flattered ,  really ,  but right now i  -  - 
so tell me about you and the chancellor . 
jesus .  there must be two dozen windows on that thing .  how are we supposed to find his ? 
oh ,  come on ,  tripp .  cut the kid some slack . 
i want to publish this .  i &apos;ve got to .  i think they &apos;ll let me .  with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant . 
so whose car is it ? 
kind of a sign ,  you &apos;re saying . 
came to my senses . 
no .  .  . 
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500 .  you driving this car ? 
the last month maybe . 
better luck next time . 
vernon . 
who the hell is that ? 
trust me ,  i understand .  i just want to say something to you ,  grady . 
are you and hannah seeing each other ,  james ? 
you cold ,  james ? 
the one she wore on her wedding day ? 
pretty good .  i &apos;m friends with dr .  gaskell ,  too . 
you mean ,  with your wife leaving you and all ?   hannah mentioned something about it .  about a note . 
oh .  so .  is  -  -  is your friend crabtree  -  -  is he  -  -  gay ? 
he didn &apos;t give his name . 
he wanted to know if a grady tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 ford galaxie 500 with black interior . 
i got kicked out .  well ,  not exactly kicked out .  i was asked to leave . 
there is ,  but it &apos;s not that interesting . 
i can &apos;t help myself .  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with me . 
outside scranton . 
i &apos;m telling you what i was told by my uncle .  and he should know .  he ran half a dozen men &apos;s clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt . 
maybe she didn &apos;t come here . 
relax .  emily hasn &apos;t carried a house key since she was twelve years old .  and your hips are as slim as hers . 
okay ,  james ,  i wish you hadn &apos;t shot my girlfriend &apos;s dog .  even though poe and i weren &apos;t exactly what you &apos;d call simpatico ,  that &apos;s no reason for him to take two in the chest .  still ,  the fact remains that i &apos;m the one who took you up into the chancellor &apos;s bedroom .  i &apos;m the one who has to take the blame .  i don &apos;t know what the hell i was thinking . 
you &apos;re lying . 
let me spell it out for you ,  james .  books don &apos;t mean anything .  not to anybody .  not anymore . 
you coming ? 
i &apos;m not going ,  with them . 
yes ,  hannah ? 
me ?  sure .  why ? 
i &apos;ve been re - reading arsonist &apos;s daughter .  it &apos;s so beautiful ,  grady .  so natural .  it &apos;s like all your sentences always existed ,  just waiting around in style heaven ,  or wherever ,  for you to fetch them down . 
all right .  take him to my place .  he can crash on the sofa . 
i know i shouldn &apos;t have ,  but there it was ,  just sort of lying out ,  and i couldn &apos;t resist and  -  -  and  -  -  i suck . 
jesus . 
right .  anyway ,  i was wondering if i could borrow your car .  mine &apos;s sort of out of commission . 
i &apos;m kidding .  hello ? 
and the jacket ? 
i &apos;m through improvising . 
i know . 
did you just make that up ? 
who &apos;s he barking at now ? 
he &apos;s writing his name in water . 
i know it &apos;s you ,  grady ,  i just .  .  .  christ ,  grady ,  do you know what time it is ? 
no .  i guess you &apos;re here for the backpack . 
what made you pull out that old thing ? 
where &apos;s emily ,  hank ? 
she &apos;s in philadelphia seeing linda aahby .  the neurologist . 
she &apos;ll be twelve next week .  we &apos;re throwing a big party on saturday .  wish i could ask you to come .  .  . 
cherry . 
she was going to throw it out ,  wasn &apos;t she ?  just toss it like a scrap of wood . 
i &apos;ve got some pictures .   want to see ? 
ah ,  come on . 
c &apos;mon ,  walter . 
you &apos;re a good man ,  walter .  okay ,  you did some wrong things ,  but inside you &apos;re a good ,  decent man . 
see anything interesting ? 
what &apos;s up ? 
i haven &apos;t broken any laws . 
i would . 
and when you sit by the window ,  watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by ,  do you wave your wanger at the girls ?  is that when you jerk off ? 
so .  how are you adjusting ? 
and your new apartment ? 
but you are taking it ? 
i &apos;d keep away from him . 
i &apos;m twelve . 
walter . 
banished .  .  .  yeah . 
what ? 
that &apos;s right ,  you did .   have you made any friends there ? 
it &apos;s very good ,  indeed . 
do you know what  &quot; normal &quot;  is ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
no ,  i am not going to  -  - 
when i say the word  &quot; girl &quot;  what is the earliest image that you can remember ? 
all right .  a small house .  .  .  with small rooms . 
very weird . 
you never spoke to me before . 
southern light . 
your windows face south .  northern light is the purest .  but southern light is very good . 
so ? 
i didn &apos;t say i didn &apos;t enjoy it . 
do you ? 
i thought i &apos;d stay the night . 
molested little girls ? 
i never hurt them .  never . 
depraved ?  my mistake . 
i &apos;ve changed . 
most people say the odds are against me . 
are you serious ? 
neither am i . 
i heard they were filthy birds . 
okay so far . 
i can &apos;t believe you let them do this ! 
i was ,  but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here .   only here isn &apos;t where i left it ,  is it ,  bud ? 
you never did like being called that ,  did you ? 
you wanna know what i think ? 
i haven &apos;t worn mine in months . 
what &apos;s the scoop ,  ace ? 
you dumb jarhead motherf -  - 
we &apos;ll take reading as we go .   if the reactor &apos;s breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris ,  we &apos;ll back away .   simple . 
look ,  it &apos;s three am .   these guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep .   you better start cutting them some slack . 
coffey ,  we &apos;re a little pressed for time . 
did you find wilhite ? 
what &apos;s the matter with you ? 
come on ,  man .   what else could it be ? 
lins ,  stay away from that guy .   i mean it . 
hafta .  .  .  go on to .  .  .  the moonpool .   only way . 
i think they &apos;re from  &apos;you know &apos; .   some place that has similar conditions .  .  .  cold ,  intense pressure .   no light . 
those guys ain &apos;t so tough .   i fought plenty of guys tougher &apos;n them . 
deepcore ,  deepcore .  .  .  this is cab three on final approach . 
you boss is having a full - on meltdown .   guy &apos;s fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we &apos;re all ringside ! 
high - pressure nervous syndrome .   muscle tremors ,  usually in the hands first .   nausea ,  increased excitability ,  disorientation . 
he can still make it . 
what kind of light ? 
when do you have to go back ? 
and have you any other truths to tell me ? 
it &apos;s already two hours .  .  .  what are we going to do ? 
it couldn &apos;t have come from anywhere else .  at least ,  somewhere from that vicinity .  .  .  but i really can &apos;t understand it .  contraband cigarettes on that island !  it &apos;s the first time that ever happened . 
what is that one over there called ? 
really !  still ,  it remains to be seen why she invented a shark .  what was her purpose in that ? 
shall we go for a swim ? 
claudia ,  listen to me .  .  . 
sandro  .  .  . what &apos;s the matter ? 
no ,  sandro .  .  .  please .  .  . 
sandro ,  i &apos;m not coming down . 
good night ,  my love . 
i love you . 
i don &apos;t love you . 
please ,  you come too .  .  . 
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat ? 
up until now those smugglers were operating only around the palermo area .  this will be a nice surprise for the lieutenant in milazzo .  .  .  call up headquarters .  bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate . 
let &apos;s see you dive from the top of those rocks ,  giulia .  that would be really sensational .   come on ,  giulia  .  .  .  your life is much too circumscribed . 
giulia .  .  . 
but why me ?  .  .  .  ask claudia ,  she &apos;s much more beautiful than me . 
then it &apos;s impossible for her to know me .  in the villa where i &apos;m at ,  we have a male gardener . 
music ,  of course .  to get a sweetheart ,  one has to look around ,  but to get a radio ,  all you have to do is buy one . 
then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses ? 
are you the owner of this place ? 
we &apos;ve decided to go to montaldo &apos;s place .  in fact ,  ettore should already be there . 
raimondo .  .  .  do you enjoy fishing underwater ? 
you &apos;ve made some mistake there with the bushes .  .  .  that &apos;s why you can &apos;t finish it . 
zuria ? 
about fifty miles or so .  if you want ,  i &apos;ll give you the name of the storekeeper . 
no . 
no he doesn &apos;t .  he hates fat people . 
that &apos;s because they &apos;re suffering .  .  .  suffering is beautiful ,  i want to be beautiful . 
christ said it in the bible ,  he said  -  suffer the little children ,  i want to suffer like a little child . 
mommy i &apos;ll get bigger and bigger every day and then i &apos;ll pop but .  .  .  but if i stay little it won &apos;t happen . 
i &apos;m being punished . 
i don &apos;t know . 
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears ,  asking for comfort ,  comfort because she was too old to have any children .  not that she wanted to ,  but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility . 
for what ? 
have you ever loved anyone ? 
down .  .  .  there . 
no .  .  .  no ,  i &apos;m tired of talking ,  i &apos;ve been talking for weeks ,  nobody believes me when i tell them anything .  .  .  nobody listens to me . 
why do you smoke ? 
no wonder .  .  .  wait .  .  .  agnes .  .  .  agnes how do you feel about babies ? 
it &apos;s like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl . 
how did she know that ? 
agnes ,  did you love your mother ? 
why not ? 
is that what she said ? 
 .  .  .  and that you don &apos;t believe you carried a child . 
how does she know that ? 
oh ,  yes . 
why ? 
did anyone else know about the baby ? 
which one ? 
of what ? 
is someone in the room with you ? 
that &apos;s good .  do you feel well enough to stand ? 
from the belltower the day she before she died . 
it was dead . 
look into the convent records . 
eve ,  she strangled a baby ! 
the bishop is breathing down our necks . 
larry .  .  . 
thanks .  
martha ,  it &apos;s you . 
would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long . 
oh that one there ,  in the corner . 
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor .  but it does make all the difference to agnes . 
and you didn &apos;t try to find out who ? 
why didn &apos;t you take her to a doctor ? 
you hate us don &apos;t you ? 
i &apos;m only interested .  .  . 
i am not a virgin ,  doctor .  i was married for twenty three years ,  two daughters .  i even have grandchildren .  .  .  surprised ?  it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother .  my children won &apos;t even see me any more ,  that &apos;s their revenge .  i think they tell their friends that i &apos;ve passed on .  and don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m making up for past mistakes doctor freud .  
what good would it do .  no matter what you decide it &apos;s either the .  .  .  the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin . 
you lied to me
do you know what she did to her ? 
she molested her ! 
why didn &apos;t you do anything to stop her ? 
i haven &apos;t decided yet . 
pipe ! 
do you think agnes is still attached to god ? 
stop this ,  she &apos;ll hurt herself  i &apos;m not going to allow this . 
she &apos;s been touched by god ,  yes . 
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out . 
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won &apos;t face the fact that she was raped .  .  .  or seduced .  .  .  or that she did the seducing . 
oh ,  would you stop lying mother ! 
was it you ? 
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room . 
and the baby . 
i doubt that &apos;s what she &apos;d say . 
that &apos;s enough . 
lay them down . 
you heard ,  it gets on my wick . 
i &apos;m a deserter . 
oh ,  it &apos;s all right . 
ginger &apos;s mad ,  he says things all the time and eddy &apos;s good at punching and spitting . 
can you fix him for me ? 
that &apos;s right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches .  i don &apos;t go round messing about with your ear - phones ,  do i ? 
i mean lines ,  ducky ,  can you handle lines ? 
make a note of that word and give it to susan .  i think it &apos;s rather touching really .  here &apos;s this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he &apos;ll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn &apos;t wearing one of these nasty things .  of course they &apos;re grotty ,  you wretched nit ,  that &apos;s why they were designed ,  but that &apos;s what you &apos;ll want . 
oh ,  listen to teacher &apos;s pet . 
yes .  your grandfather &apos;s stirred him up . 
you haven &apos;t ,  you &apos;re just late .   oh ,  yes ,  he &apos;s going to be very pleased with you . 
come on ,  auntie ,  you &apos;re winning . 
what are we waiting for ? 
sorry . 
you &apos;re from liverpool ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
thank you . 
oh ,  you &apos;re the understudy ,  sort of thing ? 
but that &apos;s not like a real person at all . 
 .  .  .  all this and a jam butty too !  ! 
why ?  i mean ,  which are you ,  scared or selfish ? 
well ,  it &apos;s nice to know you think we &apos;re clever . 
pity . 
ah . 
at least i &apos;ve a backlog of memories ,  but all you &apos;ve got is that book ! 
and what &apos;s it all come to in the end ? 
when you could be out there betraying a rich american widow or sipping palm wine in tahiti before you &apos;re too old like me .  a fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life &apos;s goodies before the sands run out .  being an old age pensioner &apos;s a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the friday queue at the post office . 
what are you doing ? 
you ugly ,  great brute you ,  you have sadism stamped all over your bloated british kisser . 
you see .   you know your trouble  -  -  you should have gone west to america .  you &apos;d have wound up a senior citizen of boston .  as it is you took the wrong turning and what happened ,  you &apos;re a lonely old man from liverpool . 
well ,  don &apos;t be daft ,  i &apos;ve got to . 
oh for pete &apos;s sake ,  it &apos;s only a joke . 
what are you doing there ? 
you won &apos;t interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality ,  will you ,  girl ? 
no . 
oh ,  it &apos;s got round that you &apos;re a heavy punter . 
john ,  i &apos;m talking to you .  this final run through is important< / u> .  understand ?  important . 
is it ? 
that &apos;s what you tell me . 
well ,  look after him .  i don &apos;t want to find you &apos;ve lost him . 
have you< / u> lost him ? 
well ,  you stick to that story ,  son . 
down the  .  .  .  er  .  .  . 
he &apos;s out there somewhere ,  causing trouble just to upset me . 
how &apos;s that ? 
eh ,  what &apos;s all this ? 
shove the gentleman jockey in the make - up room or something and keep your eye on him ,  will you ? 
i feel like shit .  .  . 
do you remember the pyramid ? 
any rotation ? 
close enough to walk to ! 
computer ,  what language was that ? 
well ,  get started . 
he< / u> died . 
but we can &apos;t kill it .   if we kill it ,  it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space . 
that one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets  -  -  you notice ?   the food storage room on one end  -  - 
jay .  .  .  how &apos;s it coming on the repairs ? 
it &apos;s really on there tight . 
hey ,  are you guys still there ?  what &apos;s going on ? 
we can &apos;t expect to understand a life form like this .   we &apos;re out of our back yard .   things are different here . 
it &apos;s a crude symbolic language  -  -  looks primitive . 
i &apos;ll do it .   the rest of you continue . 
now we &apos;re in for it . 
no ,  don &apos;t open the door .   we don &apos;t want it escaping . 
the machine will bring his temperature down .   his vital functions are strong . 
you can &apos;t say that; i think it &apos;s a good plan . 
the flamethrower ! 
can you get them back ? 
it &apos;s some kind of organ  -  -  it &apos;s inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat . 
blow the ship up ? 
what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold ?   that &apos;s the only reason we came out here .  we &apos;d have to abandon them all .   we &apos;d be broke . 
well ,  we can &apos;t go anywhere in this darkness .   how long till dawn ? 
receiving . 
if we don &apos;t hear from him soon ,  i think we better go in after him . 
but what can we do ?   he &apos;s out of radio contact . 
what is it< / u> ? 
we &apos;re just plain lucky .   that could have gone right through the hull  -  -  taken weeks< / u> to patch it . 
we &apos;re going home .   we &apos;re in hyperspace . 
i thought i &apos;d find you here . 
we came out there ,  we &apos;ll go back .   a long time by the clock ,  but a short time to us . 
men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe .   this is an opportunity which may never come again . 
source of transmission is to the northeast .  .  .  about 300 meters . 
these day and night cycles are totally disorienting .   i feel like we &apos;ve been here for days ,  but it &apos;s only been how long ? 
not a one .   it &apos;s dead . 
okay ,  chaz ,  i hear you .   i &apos;ve got you on my board .

so the only question left is :  who gets to crawl down the airshaft ? 
poor kitty; puss puss puss . 
that &apos;ll blow the ship up . 
but the lifeboat can &apos;t accelerate to light speed . 
that was melkonis .  .  .  it ate hunter .  .  . 
no good .  .  .  it &apos;s eaten too much of me .  .  . 
a pair of incomings .   they popped - up on the medium - range about thirteen twenty - four local time . 
seal everything now ! 
i found it .  .  . 
marsco went belly - up on the dow jones .

she was running a little sluggish on the way back .   think the turbines might be playing up . 
thanks . 
hey ,  boss .   wondered where you &apos;d gotten to . 
i &apos;ve got a lot of thinking to do .    &apos;sides ,  the room was getting too crowded for me . 
i &apos;m serious .   that &apos;s why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations . 
uh - huh .   used to get it pretty bad .   i &apos;d wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch . 
what is that ? 
so ,  what do you think ? 
hurry it up . 
may i come in ? 
she mentioned ,  of course ,  that margo expects to play the part ? 
just like that ,  eh ? 
aren &apos;t you ? 
you sat and talked until it was light .  .  . 
what do you take me for ? 
what have you got to do with it ? 
it is true that your parents were poor .  they still are .  and they would like to know how you are  -  and where .  they haven &apos;t heard from you for three years .  .  . 
you used my name and my column to blackmail karen into getting you the part of  &quot; cora &quot;   -  and you lied to me about it ! 
i don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s a drink left .  .  . 
let &apos;s go sit by the piano . 
answer me this .  what makes a man become a producer ? 
i was there .  an eyewitness . 
you mustn &apos;t worry about your little charge .  she is in safe hands . 
why so remote ,  addison ?  i should think you &apos;d be at the side of your protegee ,  lending her moral support .  .  . 
didn &apos;t you know ? 
how .  .  .  how was miss caswell ? 
right here .  a minute ago . 
the lack of pretense ,  that sort of strange directness and understanding - 
i leave in a week  -  the picture &apos;s all wrapped up ,  we previewed last night .  .  .  those previews .  like opening out of town ,  but terrifying .  there &apos;s nothing you can do ,  you &apos;re trapped ,  you &apos;re in a tin can - 
wait a minute !  you can &apos;t hang up ,  you haven &apos;t even said it - 
happy birthday ,  darling .  .  . 
yeah .  .  .  i will . 
this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you  -  but i &apos;m not going to .  i &apos;m too mad - 
it &apos;s all over . 
addison -  ! 
i &apos;m nothing but a body with a voice .  no mind . 
such nonsense ,  what do you all take me for  -  little nell from the country ?  been my understudy for over a week without my knowing ,  carefully hidden no doubt - 
paranoiac ! 
don &apos;t be condescending . 
often enough to keep the franchise . 
don &apos;t run away ,  bill . 
you &apos;re always after truth  -  on the stage .  what about off ? 
margo does not play a lunatic ,  birdie . 
how do you do ,  my dear . 
adorable .  we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop . 
late for what ? 
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed .  she must &apos;ve forgot something and when she went to get it ,  she left the door open .  i sneaked in and hid till she finished .  then i just looked around  -  and pretty soon i was afraid somebody &apos;d notice the lights were on so i turned them off  -  and then i guess ,  i fell asleep . 
not at all . 
to speak to just a playwright &apos;s wife ?  i &apos;m the lowest form of celebrity .  .  . 
he &apos;ll agree with you .  tell me ,  what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out ?  just huddle in that doorway and wait ? 
there isn &apos;t another like you ,  there couldn &apos;t be - 
eve .  .  .  why don &apos;t you start at the beginning ? 
there should be a new word for happiness .  being here with miss channing has been  -  i just can &apos;t say ,  she &apos;s been so wonderful ,  done so much for me - 
 .  .  .  you want to be margo &apos;s new understudy . 
no ,  dear .  margo must go on .   as a matter of fact ,  i see no reason why you shouldn &apos;t be margo &apos;s understudy .  .  . 
you won &apos;t forget it ? 
i was wondering whether you &apos;d come at all .  . 
i don &apos;t expect you to be pleasant . 
no !  i don &apos;t expect you to believe anything .  except that the responsibility is mine .  and the disgrace . 
eve .  .  .  don &apos;t cry . 
eve .  i  -  i don &apos;t think you meant to cause unhappiness .  but you did .  more to yourself ,  perhaps  -  as it turned out  -  than to anyone else .  .  . 
you talk just as addison said you did . 
a part in a play .  you &apos;d do all that  -  just for a part in a play . 
congratulations ,  eve . 
how &apos;d hear about it ? 
well .  .  .  it started with the play before this one .  .  . 
it &apos;s been a real pleasure ,  eve . 
you haven &apos;t noticed my latest bit of interior decorating .  .  . 
while you &apos;re cleaning up ,  i &apos;ll take this to the wardrobe mistress - 
i can imagine .  .  .  you know ,  all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there  -  are you sure you won &apos;t want it yourself ? 
that &apos;s my job .   see you at tea time .  .  . 
good evening ,  mr .  dewitt . 
she &apos;s just outside the door . 
dear birdie .  won &apos;t you sit down ,  miss worthington ? 
would you like a drink ?  it &apos;s right beside you .  .  . 
do you want it on ?

so many people  -  know me .  i wish i did .  i wish someone would tell be about me .  .  . 
i don &apos;t suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn &apos;t ? 
how was the concert ? 
you can &apos;t put her out ,  i promised .  .  .  margo ,  you &apos;ve got to see her ,  she worships you ,  it &apos;s like something out of a book - 
what time is it ? 
if we could cast it properly ,  that is .  .  . 
you &apos;ve got to admit it would be a novelty . 
you mean  -  all this time  -  she &apos;d done nothing but apologize ?  what &apos;d you say ? 
when you do ,  let me in on it . 
i thought you knew .  .  .  she was put on over a week ago - 
i &apos;m sure . 
how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready ,  so willing and so able to go on . 
i placed .  .  .  ? 
supposed you dropped dead .  what about your inventory ? 
promise . 
are you breaking the contract ? 
what the hell were you doing rewriting my story -  - 
forget it ,  the main thing -  -    -  - did you call me a failure ? 
all right ,  what do we know ? 
 -  - i &apos;m not interested in theory .  what do we know ?  for example ,  hunt &apos;s disappeared . 
 -  - what do you think ?  -  - 
 -  - i &apos;m trying -  - 
 -  -  - fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep -  - 
christ ,  and i even know somebody at the phone company -  -

that twenty - five thousand dollars is money i collected for nixon in this year &apos;s campaign . 
you thought i &apos;d help out on specifics ?   i &apos;ll confirm what you get ,  try to keep you on the right track ,  but that &apos;s all .   are you guys really working ?   how much ? 
fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats ? 
we know that -  - and if we were wrong ,  we &apos;re resigning -  - were we wrong ? 
where ?

mr .  john mitchell ,  the head of creep ,  says it means nothing .    &quot;  .  .  . this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent .  these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity ,  and we will not forget it or condone it .  &quot;

your eames table is incredible .   and the b&b .   i just put that in a client &apos;s home ,  actually ,  but in red . 
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort . 
but you &apos;re very private people .   you know ,  there &apos;s a kind of elitism .  .  . 
the wrong word ,  maybe .   delete that .  and ,  you know ,  the dog barks incessantly . 
scout &apos;s honor .

but can there be a society composed of just two ants ? 
princess ,  has it ever occurred to you that they &apos;re not going to rescue you< / u> ? 
come on ,  z . 
bala ,  that  -  -  that lake we found  -  -  i think the tunnel &apos;s right underneath it !    -  -  formica &apos;s going to flood the< / u> colony< / u> !  !  !   that &apos;s what he meant when said there were too many ants ! 
who is that idiot ? 
you just stick by old barbatus .  he &apos;ll watch out for you .   whatsamatter ,  kid ?   leave a girl behind ? 
so we &apos;re going back for more armor ,  right ?   i mean ,  these guys are from outer space ,  how are we supposed to beat them ?  ! 
barbatus !   you  -  -  you saved my life ! 
princess bala ,  sir .   your fiancee . 
actually ,  sir ,  we &apos;re ahead of schedule .   we have thirty - six seconds available right now . 
good .   you &apos;re a good soldier . 
lays it on a little thick ,  doesn &apos;t he ?   if you ask me ,  he &apos;s one giant bore . 
no  -  -  you  -  -  you don &apos;t understand ! 
son ,  you &apos;re an ant after my own heart .   a warrior .   an ant that looks death right in the face and laughs< / u> . 
all these parties are so marvellously alike< / u> . 
weaver ,  they &apos;re career girls .  they &apos;re obsessed with digging .   no ,  i &apos;ll probably never meet the girl for me . 
of course .   you were born two seconds after me . 
yeah ,  i know . 
what gives ,  baxter ?  you getting promoted or getting fired ? 
sure . 
oh ,  i even know who you live with  -  -  your sister and brother - in -  law  -  -  i know when you were born  -  -  and where  -  -  i know all sorts of things about you . 
three . 
guess i made a boo - boo ,  huh ? 
i &apos;m so ashamed .  why didn &apos;t you just let me die ? 
here .  how about some breakfast ? 
when are you coming home ? 
i didn &apos;t mean it that way  -  -  i was just talking to him on the phone  -  -  he &apos;s very concerned about you . 
i just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time .  bud  how many guys were there ? 
you are ? 
do i have to ? 
who was that ? 
it &apos;s only one story down  -  -  the best you can do is break a leg . 
i would . 
 -  -  mr .  sheldrake . 
some people take ,  some people get took  -  -  and they know they &apos;re getting took  -  -  and there &apos;s nothing they can do about it . 
uh - huh .  while i was sitting there ,  trying to make my mind up ,  a cop stuck his head in the car ,  because i was illegally parked  -  -  so i started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off  -  -  pow ! 
say ,  you &apos;re pretty good with that racquet . 
i know .   i suppose you heard about mr .  sheldrake  -  -  ? 
are you sure ?  how &apos;s your knee ? 
where are you going ?  bud who knows ?  another neighborhood  -  -  another town  -  -  another job  -  -  i &apos;m on my own . 
did you hear what i said ,  miss kubelik ?  i absolutely adore you . 
would you mind repeating the question ? 
you do ? 
baxter ,  an insurance company is founded on public trust .  any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming  -  -   how many charter members are there in this little club of yours ? 
it also says here  -  -  that you are alert ,  astute ,  and quite imaginative  -  - 
this ? 
now remember ,  baxter  -  -  this is going to be our little secret . 
here you are ,  baxter .  have a nice time . 
morning ,  gentlemen .   everything satisfactory ?  you like your office ? 
so it was .   she threw it at me . 
hello ?   -  -  yes  -  -  what &apos;s on your mind ,  baxter ? 
i thought maybe you &apos;d like to be here when she wakes up . 
for me ?  i don &apos;t think so .  but i was hoping maybe you could do something for her  -  - 
yes ,  sir . 
i see . 
you &apos;re on your way up ,  buddy - boy .  and you &apos;re practically out of liquor . 
baxter ,  we &apos;re a little disappointed in you  -  -  gratitude - wise . 
buddy - boy  -  -  she won &apos;t keep that long  -  -  not even on ice .   listen ,  kid ,  i can &apos;t pass this up  -  -  she looks like marilyn monroe . 
we went to bat for you  -  -  and now you won &apos;t play ball with us . 
dear mr .  macintosh  -  -   vanderhof ,  public relations .  oh ,  yes ,  baxter .  just a minute .   all right ,  miss finch  -  -  type up what we got so far .   now what is it ,  baxter ? 
quite an office  -  -  name on the door  -  -  rug on the floor  -  -  the whole schmear . 
she &apos;ll sleep on and off for the next twenty - four hours .  of course ,  she &apos;ll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up  -  - 
it &apos;s just that she &apos;s got a family  -  -  and there &apos;s the people in the office  -  -  look ,  doc ,  can &apos;t you forget you &apos;re a doctor  -  -  let &apos;s just say you &apos;re here as a neighbor  -  - 
say ,  baxter  -  -  we &apos;re having a little party and we ran out of ice  -  -  so i was wondering  -  - 
family ? 
a night like this ,  it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment . 
say ,  what &apos;s going on here ,  anyway ? 
hi ,  buddy - boy .  what happened to you ? 
sleeping pills . 
what for ? 
no ,  jeff .  i can &apos;t stay very long .   can i have a frozen daiquiri ? 
i never said goodbye ,  fran . 
i saw my lawyer this morning  -  -  i wanted his advice   -  -  about the best way to handle it  -  - 
i &apos;m sure .  if you &apos;ll just tell me that you still love me  -  - 
how could i be so stupid ?  you &apos;d think i would have learned by now  -  -  when you &apos;re in love with a married man ,  you shouldn &apos;t wear mascara . 
that little punk  -  -  after all i did for him !  he said i couldn &apos;t bring anybody to his apartment  -  -  especially not miss kubelik .  what &apos;s he got against you ,  anyway ? 
please ,  sylvia !   it &apos;s a quarter to nine ! 
where do you live ? 
all right  -  -  i &apos;ll take you to the subway . 
why don &apos;t we send her to a movie  -  -  like ben - hur ? 
hey ,  dad  -  -  why don &apos;t we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive ? 
you came in on that boat ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
we could use some fuel  -  -  just a half drum  -  -  just enough to get us out a here . 
good  -  -  like i said ,  take your pick . 
moonby what ? 
that &apos;s good gin . 
sometimes . 
thirty  -  -  sometimes fifty . 
arch light . 
charlie ? 
he killed that guy without feeling anything . 
can i go get those mangos now ? 
what &apos;d he say ? 
what the hell is it ? 
rocks ,  sand  -  -  those two men who deserted . 
listen . 
jesus  -  -  that guy &apos;s too damn much . 
touchy . 
you want me to clean it up  -  -  simple and quiet . 
do me a favor buddy ,  please . 
captain b . l .  willard ,  g - 4 headquarters ,  reporting as ordered ,  sir . 
attacks repulsed ,  as i was saying .   this is only  for this war ,  captain .  viet cong  -  -  54; north vietnamese regular forces  -  -  15; south vietnamese  -  -  28  -  -  regular forces and otherwise .   americain  -  -  6 .  of course ,  they were ,  perhaps ,  mistakes ,  captain . 
upriver ?  why upriver ?  there is nothing there ,  only jungle . 
where &apos;ve you been riding ,  lance ? 
yeah ,  i &apos;m an artist ,  goddamit  ! 
eagle thrust four  -  -  big duke six .  join me in sparaying some trees . 
seems to me he got himself fragged .  i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent .  maybe a rumor .  helluva man  -  -  remarkable officer .  walter kurtz woulda been a general some day .  general of the army .  shit ,  head of the joint chiefs of staff .  did you knew kurtz ? 
we &apos;ll come in low out of the rising sun  -  -  we &apos;ll put on the music about a mile out . 
colonel kurtz ,  i guess . 
what other reason could you have come ?  a captain .  ranger .  paratrooper .  graduate of the recondo school .  am i right about these things ? 
i said get the fuck out  !   i &apos;m going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow .   he &apos;s only stayed alive this long because he &apos;s a good orderly and medic .  he knows how to use a hypodermic . 
i think think a lie stinks . 
you could never figure it because it doesn &apos;t make sense . 
and you admired him ? 
are you finished surfing ? 
no  -  -  no ,  captain . 
you hear it again ? 
captain  -  -  that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff ? 
the other one  -  - 
i &apos;d just clear out as soon as i could if i were you ,  sir .  they &apos;re gonna start working on the bridge with torches again .  charlie will start throwing it in hard  -  - 
pre - australian ,  actually .  but i &apos;d dig goin &apos; to california .  i &apos;m california dreamin &apos; . 
you must realize ,  captain  -  -  we have lost much here  -  -  i ,  my husband .  gaston  -  -  his wife and son . 
yes . 
i don &apos;t know anything about these papers ,  sir . 
well ,  you know i don &apos;t have the priority to do that ,  sir .  it says here not to contact com - sec -  int .  who &apos;s your commanding officer  ? 
you came right to it ,  son of a bitch  -  - 
hard to work up an interest in politics ,  way we live .   you &apos;re the first people we &apos;ve seen in two weeks . 
you talk about ecology  -  -  there it is . 
first you save my ass ,  now you want to kill me .   make up your goddamn mind . 
remember that demon in the gut ?  sometimes it &apos;s nothing more than wondering if the so - called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you .   that &apos;s what you want out of this ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
95   continued : 
 .  .  . i won &apos;t let a killer walk ! 
165  continued :   
212  continued : 
where &apos;d you say eric is ? 
what about that hotheaded marshal ,  sam wilder ?   i heard he was in the middle of this mess . 
stay here . 
going after killers isn &apos;t the same as chasing poachers ,  eric . 
be careful ,  okay ? 
you &apos;re hurt . 
ben corbett ? 
most dangerous thing in the world :  a regular joe ,  in over his head .   you trying to prove how tough you are for me ,  or for yourself ? 
let &apos;s camp .   there &apos;s grayling under this ice .  i &apos;ll snare some for dinner . 
answer and i &apos;ll shoot ! 
can we buy the marshal some dinner ? 
sam ,  listen  -  -  i shot to defend my man .   other guy drew first . 
i &apos;ll get loose before that plane comes .

will you rent me a cabin ,  or not ? 
 -  -  here ?  !   where &apos;s wilder ? 
look ,  mr .  desmond ,  i didn &apos;t count on it turning this ugly . 
nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that ,  correct ?   that &apos;s good .   now ,  eric ,  you &apos;re gonna hand your prisoner over to us . 
you &apos;re out of your greedy goddamn mind . 
dead .   trappers killed him . 
it &apos;s a three - hour flight .   they shoulda got there yesterday . 
 .  .  . ben never sent a signal . 
naah ,  wilder knows we got friends in town . 
what is it you want ?  what ? 
how was it talking to him ? 
hi .  .  .   did you know there are doctors who come to your house ?

nice of you .  .  .  thank you . 
the stiff one eye ? 
melvin ,  i &apos;d rather not . 
hi . 
i was going to do that for you . 
that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away .  never fails . 
you don &apos;t owe me that . 
if you ask me .  .  .  i &apos;ll say ,   &quot; yes .  &quot;

what do you want ? 
i don &apos;t blame you .  .  .  this is a monumental first day out .  .  .  you sad or anything ?

what the heck are those for ? 
you said you could help me  -  -  what was that  -  -  a tease ? 
you changed the room around .  .  . 
so ,  what &apos;s new anyway ?  how &apos;s verdell ? 
it &apos;s not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind  -  -  but he did throw up twice and his spark is off . 
take my car  -  -  a convertible .  do you drive ? 
okay .  so you call 911 and don &apos;t leave your name  -  -  even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name .  how come you make a mistake like that ? 
frank sachs  -  -  melvin udall . 
rot in hell ,  melvin . 
well ,  i &apos;ll do one thing for you that might cheer you up . 
that &apos;s very thoughtful . 
do you ever get an erection for a woman ? 
i get why you &apos;re angry .  it &apos;s no snap to explain why i was like that ,  but let &apos;s not try to do it on the run .  .  . 
good - bye .   well ,  your luck is holding .  they sublet your place .  you &apos;re homeless .  frank &apos;s got a line on another place you can use for now . 
i think you gotta camp it here .  .  . 
okay .  .  .  you tell me why  -  -    &quot; you &apos;re dying here .  &quot; 
exactly what is your previous experience ? 
so you &apos;re practically finished ,  huh ? 
wait  -  -  i want to see the painting . 
where you from ? 
why ?   what happened ? 
what are you doing ? 
that was peterson back there .   that goes to the expressway for the airport . 
how &apos;d you know ?   just tell me that .  how &apos;d you fucking know ? 
you think i would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars . 
i &apos;ll tell you this .   after cleveland ,  i thought i was lucky to be alive .   but now ,  here ,  i just realized that you were the lucky one . 
i &apos;m on the scent . 
send the file .   i &apos;ll have the estimate tonight . 
nikita ?   she helped me find you . 
you &apos;re one of them ,  aren &apos;t you ?   a fucking pro . 
now what ? 
nikita ? 
you &apos;re one of them ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
what does that mean ? 
so this is something between you and him ? 
he wants to kill you ? 
and you want to use me to get him ? 
i don &apos;t need the money . 
with computers . 
yes .   as soon as you get into this business ,  all you can think about is getting to the top .   that &apos;s all there is .   until then ,  there is nothing .   you are nothing . 
the same way everyone does; the government ,  the agency . 
it was .  .  .  mechanical .   very precise .  it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline . 
they become complicated .  .  .  messy . 
it .   tell it .   for all i know it could be a machine . 
hey ,  where are you ? 
i &apos;ve never been to the gulf of mexico .   is it as nice as they say ? 
what will you do if this works ,  if we get the money ? 
i know what you are thinking .   i &apos;m not going to disappear ,  okay ?   i &apos;m not going anywhere ,  just down there ,  to that beautiful beach .   i got to get out of this room ,  just for a little while . 
really ? 
how was the beach ? 
two way ? 
i paid a lot for these . 
he will be hidden somewhere out here ,  probably somewhere low ,  in the crowd .   he &apos;ll stay there until he sees me enter the bank . 
i &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . 
what ? 
was that it ? 
do you have ulcers ? 
why did you trade a bishop for a knight ? 
she is married ,  but not to him .  another man ,  much older .   she has four kids .   the young guy works for her .   and i think she likes kinky sex . 
what are you doing ? 
that &apos;s a ridiculous move . 
wait until he is on the stairs . 
was nice . 
he &apos;s coming ,  electra !   get out now ! 
i wasn &apos;t watching television . 
do you ever regret things you &apos;ve done ? 
how much farther ? 
hey ,  do you mind if i talk a little ?   i feel like ,  i don &apos;t know ,  talking i guess . 
one hundred thousand ?   that &apos;s it ?  jesus .  .  .  is that a lot ? 
right . 
everyone handles it differently .  some are ready ,  some are not . 
cheers katka ! 
what is it with that josh guy ?  who does he think he is shoving that reflections rag down our throats ? 
it all comes down to ideology and they &apos;ve lost theirs .  if i &apos;d been here ten years ago ,  maybe they wouldn &apos;t be in the mess they are today . 
who &apos;s your friend ? 
hmm .  . smells good .  cheers ! 
oh yeah ,  what &apos;s that ? 
squatted it . 
what we need is a space for real performance art .  a cultural exchange for radical expressionism . 
no ,  but like my dad said ,   &quot; there &apos;s only so many ways you can wire a plug &quot;  . 
and put it on expenses ? 
later mate ,  right now i &apos;ve got to do the locks on these doors so we don &apos;t have to climb through that bloody window every time . 
wow !  .  .  .  . what have you been doing ,  rolling around in it ? 
really ,   &quot; the freeman centre &quot;  ? 
no ,  not if you &apos;ve got better things to do . 
we &apos;d better get some booze in for tonight . 
what happened to katka ? 
well ,  the trial &apos;s in two weeks ,  but i think they &apos;ve already sentenced me .  they just need to check if siberia can slot me in . 
you know ,  there is one thing i can &apos;t figure out .  all along they &apos;ve been bugging me about those files and when i told them i &apos;d burned all that stuff ,  they went nuts  -  they told the consul guy they were medical records ? 
time for lunch i think .  i &apos;ll get the sandwiches .  what would you like holly ? 
sure ,  it &apos;s on the red metro line you .  .  .  . 
take this exit . 
jesus holly ,  we got enough time . 
it &apos;s that one isn &apos;t it . 
there shooting at something . 
well ,  i &apos;ll try and get that clarified .  as i understand it though ,  the charges include break and enter ,  theft ,  trespass ,  operating an unlicensed facility ,  vandalism and destruction of government documents  -  whatever possessed you to start destroying people &apos;s medical records ? 
i &apos;d like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here .  .  .  . a weekly thing . 
so what &apos;s it going to be ,  coogan &apos;s or u vayvudoo ? 
it &apos;s just talk ,  he &apos;s drunk . 
don &apos;t give me this kat ,  i &apos;m doing it for you and your country . 
let &apos;s walk over the bridge ,  we haven &apos;t done that for a while . 
kat ,  i &apos;m in paradise .  i don &apos;t ever want to leave . 
i want you so bad .  she &apos;ll be asleep soon ,  maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets . 
i think i &apos;m stupid .  .  .  .  . all you do is use me and expect me to wait for you . 
no ,  i love you ,  really . 
hi ,  want to take up dancing ? 
no thanks ,  i must go ,  but maybe you could get some beers for the guys . 
okay ? 
you can hold back this months pay - check until i come through with the story . 
no act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other .  as life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need ,  so deep no light could reach ,  surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display .  left alone in a rose - tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale - skin body . 
a champion of lost causes huh ? 
it &apos;s all my fault ,  i &apos;m so sorry doug . 
what was the real purpose behind this venture ? 
would you like your things now ? 
honey what a pleasant surprise ,  sorry to keep you waiting . 
will you come home and forget all about him ? 
what are you an idiot ! 
it was crazy not to have destroyed them
and what of these foreigners ? 
she &apos;s coming over here .  .  . 
she asleep ? 
you look nice .  i should have dressed . 
you do .  you &apos;re handsome and charming . 
that &apos;s eight years of school and training  -  -  after college .  and all that doesn &apos;t necessarily make you a better human being . 
but if it doesn &apos;t happen ,  grab for something within reach .  life &apos;s tough enough without causing yourself disappointment  -  - 
i told him to leave me alone . 
where is he ?  he &apos;s supposed to be here . 
hypotheticals  -  - 
you got some kind of list ? 
saturn .  beautiful . 
i &apos;m building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley &apos;s comet  -  - 
no . 
you have to believe to have faith . 
the bible .  why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles . 
people can see . 
all of it . 
okay .  maybe some of that is true  -  - 
i don &apos;t want to be just your friend  -  - 
is there a rush ? 
before we do this . 
what &apos;d you tell your father ? 
when did you build this ? 
what are you thinking ?

like you &apos;d make it to june .  even cutting half your classes ,  you have a b -  average . 
landon ,  none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself .   some of us remember how your father  -  - 
no way .  no thanks .  i can &apos;t do it  -  -

you mean you &apos;re going to stay up all night ? 
hi ,  marty . 
is that what you were going to ask me ,  george ?  to go to the dance ?

my guess is that she turned him down . 
that &apos;s all taken care of . 
it was sure nice of uncle sam to put those yardage markers up for us .  
but if you didn &apos;t rebuild the time machine ,  how did i go back in time in the first place ?

before what ? 
well ,  bill was always the author ,  so to speak - 
barton ,  i think we should concentrate on our little project - 
barton ! 
and my input was mostly .  .  .  editorial ,  really ,  when he &apos;d been drinking - 
am i ?  maybe to a schoolboy &apos;s eye .  people who know about the human heart ,  though ,  mebbe they &apos;d say ,  bill over here ,  he gives his honey love ,  and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is . 
how long you been up there ,  fink ? 
i &apos;m a writer ,  mr .  geisler .  ted okum said i should drop by morning to see you about the

and what &apos;s your line ,  mr .  meadows ? 
 .  .  . in spite of what you might think from tonight ,  i &apos;m pretty good at it . 
hell yes .  because i believe in it .  fire ,  theft ,  and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that &apos;s what i tell  &apos;em .  writing doesn &apos;t work out ,  you might want to look into it .  providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse . 
well ,  i don &apos;t mean to get up on my high horse ,  but why shouldn &apos;t we look at ourselves up there ?   who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and  and  and who killed nigel grinch - gibbons ? 
 .  .  . and look ,  i &apos;m sorry as hell about the interruption .  too much revelry late at night ,  you forget there are other people in the world . 
oh ,  yeah .  an ear infection ,  chronic thing .   goes away for a while ,  but it always comes back .  gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus .  don &apos;t worry ,  it &apos;s not contagious . 
 .  .  . probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who &apos;s writing a wrestling picture for wallace beery . 
jesus ,  what a day i &apos;ve had .  ever had one of those days ? 
yeah ,  but 
 .  .  . ah ,  you &apos;ll lick this picture business ,  believe me .  you &apos;ve got a head on your shoulders .  what is it they say ?  where there &apos;s a head ,  there &apos;s a hope ?

he ain &apos;t that way .   he &apos;s got heart . 
i &apos;ll ask you once ,  nick  -  -  for the record did you kill him ?

no sign of the snowman . 
we cut our support .   a conflict of ideologies .   dr .  woodrue was a lunatic . 
that lab was consumed by fire last week .   how did you manage to escape ? 
forget the stars .   look here ,  at the earth ,  our mother ,  our womb .   she deserves our loyalty and protection .  and yet you spoil her lands ,  poison her oceans ,  blacken her skies .  you &apos;re killing her . 
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet . 
absolutely .   just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator . 
mcgregor &apos;s syndrome .   that &apos;s what freeze &apos;s wife had . 
like hell you do . 
is that it ,  bruce ?   i &apos;m under some magic spell ? 
you &apos;d say anything to keep me away from her .   to keep her for yourself . 
one kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face .   their secret identities would be revealed .   but how best to bait a brid ? 
it &apos;ll never work . 
gee ,  i &apos;m not sure .   alfred ?  how many rooms ?  total ?

odd desire for anyone .

there &apos;s terror everywhere .   if you train yourself to look for it .

otho &apos;ll know what to do .

where is your mother ? 
i was just trying to open the door .   mrs .  butterfield brought over a skeleton key . 
what ? 
the attic room is locked  -  - 
now ,  let &apos;s get back to business .  i want to get maxie dean and sarah up here immediately .   i can make history here !   i &apos;m going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center .  .  .  and amusement park . 
great idea ,  maxie !   those japanese could run< / u> it for us .   build them a dormitory in the woods .   listen ,  think right about it ,  will you ?  we &apos;ve almost got the house ready ,  you bring sarah with you and i &apos;ll show you . 
we &apos;ll be the< / u> art center of summer new york .   i &apos;ll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture .   and when otho and i get through with this house ,  you people are not going to recognize it . 
i can &apos;t believe you are doing this to me !   ghosts< / u> .   i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight .   otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic .   my agent ,  bernard ,  is bringing some woman who writes for architectural digest< / u> .   in fact ,  no one here tonight has not been in vanity fair< / u> .   except you . 
okay ? 
otho ,  i cannot< / u> live< / u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles . 
now ,  lydia .  .  .  favor us about your ghosts . 
look at that detail< / u> ! 
what &apos;s happening to them ? 
they don &apos;t want to come down . 
wait a minute !   what am i worried about ?   otho ,  you can &apos;t even change a tire ! 
their wedding clothes . 
it &apos;s good that there was no apparent damage to the bone . 
you can pull your trousers up ,  now . 
just to take the proper precautions ,  mr .  gardiner ,  i &apos;d recommend we take you downstairs and x - ray your leg .    .  .  .  by the way ,  mr .  gardiner ,  i would like to ask you something straight out . 
chauncey ,  there you are .  what are you doing on that leg ? 
 .  .  .  benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his financial institute today ,  but obviously ,  the strain would be impossible .  .  .  how about here ,  chauncey ,  any soreness ? 
yes .  i love eve very much . 
some pain is to be expected .  .  .    .  .  .  and i think what would be best for the two of you is a good night &apos;s rest .    .  .  .  it &apos;s late ,  i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s time for my patients to prepare for bed . 
no more ,  robert .  .  .  no more needles .  .  . 
do you know raphael ? 
oh ,  mr .  gardiner ,  i &apos;ve been looking all over . 
fine .  they felt that since you had such close ties with the president ,  you would be a splendid choice .    .  .  .  can i help you ?  are you looking for something ? 
these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to - do over a simple little accident .  of course ,  they can be very frightening ,  and i must apologize for david ,  he &apos;s never had an accident before . 
oh .  .  .  mr .  gardiner .  .  .  mr .  chauncey gardiner .  .  .  you &apos;re not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you ? 
 .  .  .  and ben is just mad about you  -  you &apos;ve lifted his spirits so  -  it &apos;s just .  .  .  well ,  it &apos;s just a real pleasure having you with us . 
chauncey ! 
good .  i &apos;m glad to hear that .    .  .  .  how did you like meeting the president ? 
oh .  well ,  we can fix up one of ben &apos;s for you tomorrow night .  sophie insists an black tie . 
 .  .  .  you know ,  chauncey .  .  .  i want us to be .  .  .   i want us .  .  .  you and i to become .  .  .  close .  .  .  i want us to become very close ,  you know .  .  .  ? 
i feel so close to you ,  so safe with you ,  chauncey .  .  .    .  .  .  and benjamin understands that ,  dearest .  .  .  he understands and accepts my feelings for you .  .  . 
i just don &apos;t excite you at all .  .  .  i don &apos;t know what you want .  .  .  i don &apos;t know what you like .  .  . 
hello ,  mr .  gardiner .  this is sid courtney ,  washington post . 
and i have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues  -  so why not a coming together ?  an interchange of opinion ?  we may find ,  my friend ,  that we are not so far from each other ,  not so far ! 
 .  .  .  we &apos;re prisoners ,  mr .  gardiner  -  we &apos;re prisoners of tubes and technology . 
well ,  that &apos;s good news ,  my boy . 
 .  .  .  you know ,  chauncey ,  there &apos;s something about you .  .  .  you &apos;re direct ,  you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly .  you don &apos;t play games with words to protect yourself .  i feel i can speak to you frankly .  .  .  you know what i was talking to you about last night ? 
 .  .  .  i &apos;m about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel ,  my boy .  .  . 
we could do it now ,  we can go upstairs .    .  .  .  please ,  it &apos;s time for us .  come upstairs . 
watch ?  you mean just watch me ?  doing it alone ? 
sure you do !  no one reads !  .  .  .  listen ,  book publishing isn &apos;t exactly a bed of roses these days .  .  . 
may i help you ,  mr .  gardiner ? 
 .  .  .  did you wish to see someone ,  sir ? 
your appearance doesn &apos;t suggest that at all ,  mr .  chance . 
some pictures .  .  .  ? 
might you have a birth certificate ,  mr .  chance ? 
good day ,  mr .  chance . 
it &apos;s starting to swell ,  is it painful ? 
i &apos;d like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the vice president . 
come now ,  mr .  gardiner ,  before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand ,  did he not ? 
hello ,  thomas .  .  .  i &apos;m chance ,  the gardener . 
 .  .  .  you &apos;ve quite a sense of humor ,  mr .  chance  -  but all kidding aside ,  may i ask just what you are doing here ? 
how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed ? 
 .  .  .  joe ?  who &apos;s joe ? 
mr .  chance ,  that was twenty - seven years ago . 
move out ?  i don &apos;t understand ,  thomas . 
you heard ? 
thank you ,  greta .   i &apos;ll be with mr .  rand if i &apos;m needed . 
good night . 
yes ?  what have you found ? 
no ,  she flew up to boston for another charity event .  she &apos;ll be sorry to have missed you . 
john !  great to see you !  sorry about the cunt at reception . 
oh ,  thank you !  thank you !  thousand times ,  thank you ! 
they &apos;ll understand .  besides i &apos;ve got a morning appointment tomorrow with elijah &apos;s shrink .  we &apos;re getting to the bottom of this acid stomach . 
some sort of childhood trauma ,  she thinks .  possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp .  interesting ,  huh ? 
don &apos;t be ridiculous .  there is no such thing as a portal into someone else &apos;s brain . 
now ? 
i &apos;ll meet you on the turnpike . 
why aren &apos;t you at work ? 
i don &apos;t know .  there &apos;s some tension between us .  i &apos;d hate to expose you to that . 
we ? 
sure ,  after a fashion . 
you ?  why i &apos;m sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience . 
come in ,  mr .  juarez .  i &apos;d stand ,  but ,  well ,  you know . 
you think so ,  eh ?  which comes first ,  l or .  .  .  glooph ? 
wife ,  huh ?  i &apos;d love to meet her ,  craig . 
listen .  i &apos;m craig schwartz ,  just starting out at lestercorp . 
who told you ? 
im not a homosexual .  i just like women for more than their bodies .  i guess you could say i &apos;m the new american male . 
so ,  tell me about yourself .  if you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough ,  dog - boy . 
this is important ! 
there &apos;s a tiny door in that empty office .  it &apos;s a portal ,  maxine .  it takes you inside john malkovich .  you see the world through john malkovich &apos;s eyes ,  then ,  after about fifteen minutes ,  you &apos;re spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike . 
okay .  here it is .   ever want to be someone else ?  now you can .  no kidding .  only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes .  visit j . m .  inc .  ,  mertin - flemmer building .  etc .  ,  etc . 
this is amazing !  we &apos;re gonna be rich ! 
lotte ,  this is so good .  .  . 
lotte ?  is that you ? 
you &apos;ve got to tell craig what &apos;s going on .  he must never leave malkovich . 
i was just asking .  no disrespect intended . 
i &apos;m done with her now .  tonight really creeped me out . 
what ?  !  that is not allowed .  my god ,  you are supposed to be one of us .  you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself ! 
i &apos;m not certain ,  my dear ,  but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route . 
yeah ,  i saw them
sounds boring .  are there any songs ? 
i &apos;m not afraid .  i toured for a year with the national puppet company &apos;s production of  &quot; long day &apos;s journey into night .  &quot; 
oh ,  my sweet ,  beautiful lotte . 
oh ,  so the bitch escaped . 
no one would ever have to know its not him . 
they love me ,  darling !   &quot; craig schwartz is fantastic !  &quot;   the new york times .   &quot; if only craig schwartz had always been inside malkovich !  &quot;   women &apos;s wear daily .   &quot; craig schwartz  -  the world &apos;s greatest puppeteer !  &quot;   paul wunder ,  wbai radio .

well that &apos;s just ,  that &apos;s the stress talking ,  dude .   so far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes -  - 
they &apos;re nihilists . 
they kept saying they believe in nothing . 
dude ,  please !  .   .   .   is this your homework ,  larry ? 
look ,  larry .   .   .  have you ever heard of vietnam ? 
you &apos;re fucking polish catholic -  - 
this driveway . 
it &apos;s all over ,  man !   we call your fucking bluff ! 
sure you &apos;ll see some tank battles .  but fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle . 
hey ,  cool it walter .   listen ,  pal ,  there never was any money .   the big lebowski gave me an empty briefcase ,  man ,  so take it up with him . 
huh ?   no ,  she ,  she hit me right here .

well sure ,  look at it !   young trophy wife ,  i mean ,  in the parlance of our times ,  owes money all over town ,  including to known pornographers -  -  and that &apos;s cool ,  that &apos;s cool -  -  but i &apos;m saying ,  she needs money ,  and of course they &apos;re gonna say they didn &apos;t get it  &apos;cause she wants more ,  man ,  she &apos;s gotta feed the monkey ,  i mean -  -  hasn &apos;t that ever occurred to you .  .  .  ?  sir ? 
who the hell is he ? 
bullshit .  walter ! 
tom here &apos;s my ninth hard felon of the month .  six weeks he &apos;ll be sucking gas .  in three years i &apos;ll be working central warrants .  jewboy deputy d . a .  over there wets his pants for fighters .  promised me the next spot he can wangle . 
seems like he &apos;s doing me a favor ,  then . 
you &apos;re hurt . 
how do you feel ? 
let &apos;s just hope you &apos;ve kicked the thirst for good .   i &apos;ll be watching you close .  you start to back - slide  -  - 
i agree .   we play along for now ,  we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks . 
what do you think ? 
what do you really think ? 
you ask me ,  you and miss muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste . 
your security &apos;s for shit ,  kid . 
what &apos;s your problem ,  whistler ? 
come on ,  blade .   talk to me ! 
put it back in park ,  blade . 
you want me to hunt them for you . 
and why is that ? 
you got something in mind ,  blade ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
oh yeah ?   like how little ?   in case you hadn &apos;t noticed ,  we lost two men while you were out farting around . 
we want to attract them ,  not scare them off . 
his name is jared nomak . 
any casualties ? 
you &apos;re wasting your time ,  already been tried . 
why not ?  the future of our race runs through your bloodstream .  you &apos;ve got the best of both worlds ,  blade .  all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses . 
the pause that refreshes  -  -   care for some ?  smells good ,  doesn &apos;t it ?  pungent ,  with just an irrepressible hint of iron . 
you &apos;re not going anywhere . 
this is an old tongue ,  from an old world .  it concerns lamagra . 
the day walker &apos;s blood is a disparador  -  -  a trigger ,  you see ?  for lamagra &apos;s return .  one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him .    &quot; and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew ,  cleansing the world in a tide of blood .  &quot; 
and you honestly expect me to believe all this ? 
i can &apos;t just leave .  i have a life here ,  a career  -  - 
i can go to the police .  i have blood samples back at the hospital .  i can show them . 
what are you doing ?  ! 
graffiti  -  - 
what is this place ? 
what am i injecting you with ? 
you don &apos;t look so good . 
for what it &apos;s worth ,  i &apos;m sorry . 
please  -  - 
that &apos;s weird  -  - 
i see .  and what would you have us do with this  &quot; half - breed &quot;  ? 
lamagra isn &apos;t a physical being .  he &apos;s a spirit ,  requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself . 
there &apos;s no need for any of this .  your condition can be treated .  whistler and i were working on a cure when  -  - 
we keep in radio contact . 
the thirst overcomes him ,  just like the others .  it &apos;s not something he can control .   the problem is ,  time &apos;s running out .  his body &apos;s starting to reject the serum .  and so far ,  all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure  -  - 
all right ,  let &apos;s start with the basics  -  -  why do vampires need to drink blood ? 
what do you mean ? 
what happened to her ,  where did she go ? 
what ,  are you alright ? 
domini ? 
 -  - stop it !  stop talking about it !  i &apos;m gonna freak ! 
why are we here ? 
where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later . 
this is funny ?  ?  this is tens of thousands of fucking dollars !   you pricks !  i &apos;ll see you in fucking court !  ! 
jesus . 
no . 
that &apos;s a sapling -  - this< / u> mother &apos;s got to be three hundred years old ,  minimum . 
 -  - or someone -  - 
was that you laughing ? 
oh ,  jesus ,  no -  - 
i know you &apos;re in there ,  you piece of shit ! 
beer and weed is what i &apos;ve got . 
my ass -  - you saw those four fucking baboons put  &apos;em there ! 
the witch ? 
you &apos;re a complete fucking idiot ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
nice tent . 
three people :  two guys ,  a girl -  -  sleeping in the same motel room ,  the same tent night after night . 
 -  - yeah ,  a hand or something -  - 
get inside quick ,  they &apos;ll stop . 
it &apos;s freezing< / u> . 
the moon trying to shoot down through all these trees -  - can make things funky -  - 
who ? 
remember .  .  .  . what mary brown said -  -  she could see the witch &apos;s hands on my face ,  her mouth sucking on mine . 
you drive ,  i &apos;ll handle the video ,  okay ? 
was it every< / u> day or just semi -  weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid ? 
what ? 
how &apos;re the cameras doing ? 
just one lock in this neighbor -  hood ? 
you wanna keep it down ,  she &apos;s trying to sleep . 
what ? 
women miscarry all the -  - 
what &apos;s that ? 
i think you closed the bar again .  i &apos;ll have to go out . 
 -  - i know ! 
 .  .  . ray ? 
hello ? 
ray ?  .  .  .  what time is it ? 
 .  .  . you all right ? 
well .  .  .  what happened ? 
 .  .  . anyway ,  we got some time now .  but we gotta be smart . 
 .  .  . i don &apos;t know ,  wasn &apos;t it you ?  maybe a burglar broke in ,  and you found -  - 
if he does come in i &apos;m not here .  .  .  what were you drinking ,  debra ? 
 .  .  . so what &apos;re you doing tonight ? 
 .  .  . you know that car ? 
well ,  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  call it a fringe benefit . 
 .  .  . anything else ? 
i &apos;m supposed to do a murder -  - two murders -  - and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid .  i mean real stupid .  now why should i trust you ? 
 .  .  . it &apos;s too damn risky . 
no ,  he &apos;s off tonight .  where was he last night ? 
 .  .  . i thought you were dead .  going home ? 
jeffrey .  you &apos;re not going down by lincoln ,  are you ? 
doctor gynde .  my whole family &apos;s sick .  what &apos;s going on ?

well now jeffrey ,  how did you come to get so involved ? 
that oughta do it . 
the phone .  what did you hear on the phone  .  tell me .  word for word . 
what do you want from me ? 
don &apos;t .   i don &apos;t like that .  what do you want ? 
you can hit me ,  if you want to . 
i made it go down the toilet . 
oh god .  don !  !  !  why can &apos;t i just die . 
look . 
falling .

yes .  frank - 
come on dorothy . 
i asked first . 
yes . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s me . 
you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens . 
we &apos;re going to leave that up to detective williams .  i &apos;ll tell you though .  you &apos;re okay .  you shot a real son of a bitch . 
heineken . 
what do you know about the ear ?  .  anything ? 
come on .  you brought it up .  do you know anything ? 
i guess you have to get back home soon ? 
that &apos;s the building .  she lives on the seventh floor .  don &apos;t stop to look long  .  the police are watching . 
i have to help out in my father &apos;s hardware store .  they &apos;re giving me sort of my own hours for a while .  which is nice . 
what happened to him ? 
now ,  how are you going to do that ? 
thanks .  dorothy vallens .  okay .  good luck  .  three minutes ,  no sooner . 
brilliant . 
 .  i wish you wouldn &apos;t do this .   it doesn &apos;t make any sense .  let &apos;s go somewhere and have some coffee . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  i didn &apos;t . 
wow .  should you tell my father ? 
no ,  silly  -  i &apos;m still in school you know .  but i &apos;ll meet you after school and you can tell me what you &apos;ve learned .  you better be careful ,  jeffrey . 
can i give you a kiss good night ? 
shoot . 
maybe .  but i think the yellow man is on drugs .  i think frank supplies him . 
everything okay ? 
it &apos;s good to see you . 
thank you .  whatiya say we just enjoy the evening ? 
looks like they &apos;ve got you strapped in pretty good . 
how ya doin &apos; dad ? 
what time are visiting hours ? 
well .  okay . 
well . 
please excuse me a moment ,  jeffrey ,  and i &apos;ll get to the dishes . 
mike &apos;s gotta go .   nice to meet you . 
what are watchin &apos; this junk for ? 
sandy ?  .  could i talk to you a minute ? 
on the plane . 
you can &apos;t sell this to your friends . 
i would like to know the contents .  every detail is important . 
mirtha . 
what can i do for you guys ? 
and i only deal with you ? 
i don &apos;t think so . 
look ,  i &apos;m sorry about everything .   i feel like an idiot .   you were right .   i did fuck you .   and then diego fucked me .  cut me out ,  too . 
you ? 
no ? 
i thought you said we were roommates .  that we should talk about everything . 
i &apos;ve got to get out of here ,  diego . 
in my country ,  i am a magico .   a man with a dream .   a man on the rise .   to take nothing and make it something ,  okay ?   i have failed my dream ,  but i will accomplish .   that is why i am in your country .   yes ,  i lose my freedom .  but they do not take my dream .   do you have a dream ,  george ? 
getting it here is no problem .   trust me .   i &apos;ll fly it in myself if i have to .  what about supply ?   how much can we get ? 
diego ?   it &apos;s george . 
fifteen kilos .   seven and a half in each suitcase .   you receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery . 
a million dollars for our first run is not bad ,  george . 
i know . 
this is only part of the business ,  george .   a very small part .   don &apos;t worry ,  there is so much more to do .  which reminds me ,  i need a favor from you .   i must go to colombia . 
george . 
thirty - six hours .   i can &apos;t believe it .  everything is gone in thirty - six hours . 
i &apos;m very angry with you ,  george .   very angry .   you don &apos;t take me to california ,  but you take your bitch wife ?   a woman ?  i understand you love her ,  but it was you and me who started this .   you and me . 
george ,  i am happy to see you .   how are you ,  my brother ? 
you &apos;d better kill me now ,  diego ,  because you &apos;re a dead man . 
cocaine ?   how much ? 
tell him i don &apos;t want to see him .   tell him he &apos;s not welcome here . 
but ,  never mind .   i am thinking we can do much together .   this problem with diego ,  the stolen car ,  the jail ,  is very silly business .   to release him from the carcel ,  it causes me much inconvenience .  the fifty kilos could have been a big problem .   and i don &apos;t like problems . 
what do i think ?   i don &apos;t want my answer to be influenced by what i want ,  so i &apos;m going to have to say i don &apos;t know . 
i want money . 
keep them coming . 
george ,  you look terrible . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  george . 
what are you going to do ? 
give this to mom ,  will you ? 
give it to her ,  dad .   it &apos;ll make her happy . 
figured it out . 
what the fuck are you talking about ,  man ? 
do i know you ? 
jesus christ . 
no .   these are her first steps .   watch her . 
not in front of the kid . 
what ? 
i haven &apos;t seen one dollar from you .   you haven &apos;t paid me one cent in child support ,  alimony . 
hey ,  look .   you start paying ,  who knows what will happen .   you &apos;re a good father ,  george .   i always gave you that .   but you &apos;ve got to talk to her . 
what do you want from me ? 
i don &apos;t know .   maybe california . 
you let me take care of your mother .  you just pack your bags . 
i love you .   i love you so much .   you &apos;ve got to know that .   you &apos;ve got to know . 
but i have a visitor . 
listen ,  americano ,  it is very nice to meet you ,  but maybe we are going too fast .   you take a little and then come back . 
yeah ? 
nice weed ,  huh ? 
in indochina ,  they< / u> won . 
the law is often inconvenient ,  colonel  .  .  . 
even that could be a trick .  you escape ,  then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you ,  and so you are able to contact me  .  .  . 
what &apos;s important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing . 
read it . 
it &apos;s clear .  they &apos;ll do everything possible to make it fail . 
where were we ? 
all right .  see you tomorrow ,  corbiere . 
that proves that i was wrong .  evidently i credited you with an advantage greater than i should have . 
who is speaking ? 
it &apos;s very good  -  -  because when the d . a &apos;s office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape ,  otherwise they would have buried it . 
an inquiry into what ? 
marsh &apos;s cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking ,  quit drinking and started exercising every day .   does that sound like a guy who &apos;d start shoveling cocaine up his nose ? 
about three hours . 
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest . 
doctor mccurdy ,  what was the cause of death ? 
so ,  mr .  marsh used cocaine ? 
then how did it get into his body ? 
is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand ? 
dr .  mccurdy ,  what would cocaine do to someone in mr .  marsh &apos;s condition ? 
he was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago . 
why would she want that ? 
i &apos;ll tell her but she won &apos;t take it . 
you &apos;ve been following me ? 
mr .  marsh &apos;s cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied mr .  marsh to their office on at least two occasions . 
miss braslow  -  -  i &apos;m district attorney john cardenas .   you arrived at what time tonight ? 
why did you come by ? 
tell the court about that ,  please . 
doctor trammel ,  when did you first diagnose that mr .  marsh had heart disease ? 
what happened after that ? 
why does she come to you ? 
how do you instruct your patients to take it ? 
what was the nature of your relationship with dr .  paley . 
did he make your life miserable ? 
what happened next ? 
i worked for mr .  marsh for six years .  he was a good man  -  -  until she came along . 
do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom ? 
i &apos;m a practical woman mr .  dulaney .  killing andrew wasn &apos;t in my best interest .   as it is i &apos;m out of a job and i &apos;m not in his will . 
 -  - and that mr .  marsh paid less attention to you ? 
 -  - and that he changed his will ? 
dristan nasal spray . 
you must have some feeling .   some immediate impression .   a young ,  attractive woman ,  involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will .   and the things that went on in that house .   such wild sex .   what kind of picture does that paint ? 
i think we &apos;re getting a little off the subject here . 
why not ? 
how &apos;d you meet marsh ? 
can we get out of here ? 
that &apos;s not an answer . 
you and me  -  -  making love . 
you lied to me ! 
can i see you later ? 
something wrong ? 
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be able to handle him . 
you don &apos;t need anybody . 
she &apos;s right ,  paley .   you &apos;ve got to kill me .   she doesn &apos;t have to  -  -  she &apos;s free  -  -  she can &apos;t be tried again  -  -  but you ,  you planned it with her .   you supplied the coke .   you &apos;re an accessory to murder . 
because i told her you were the best criminal attorney we have . 
what are they saying ? 
michael  -  -  get off the phone . 
you &apos;re on vacation ,  remember ?   you &apos;re supposed to be relaxing . 
really . 
she sounds like quite a woman . 
did marsh use it ? 
well ,  that &apos;s a long time . 
my jewish friend &apos;s grandmother did . 
i don &apos;t mind waiting . 
eeeww ! 
what &apos;s he saying now ? 
i can &apos;t believe she never told me ?  we spoke at least once a week .  how could she do that ? 
grateful !  ? 
what are you doing ? 
then why do you ? 
i found out who lucy delaney is .   remember the delaneys from hillcrest road ? 
he remarried .  apparently they were having an affair for years .  apparently the first mrs .  delaney was a bit of a stiff . 
mrs .  delaney .   did you hear the latest ? 
oh ,  this heat !  times like this i wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to michigan . 
well ,  nobody put a gun to his head . 
no ,  leave it .  i &apos;ll do it later .  listen ,  maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday .  i &apos;m sure richard &apos;ll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all . 
well ,  you &apos;re pretty close .  it &apos;s only about two miles from here . 
are you from washington originally ? 
oh . 
are you by nature a sadistic person ? 
and how long are you here for ? 
everything does .  one of the laws of nature .  people are always so afraid of change .  but if you look at it like it &apos;s something you can count on happening ,  it &apos;s actually a comfort .  not many things you can count on for sure . 
why ?  you uncorked a bottle .  from what i can tell ,  i got here just in time .  any later and you &apos;d have made the front page ,  running down main street naked ,  smoking camels out of your butt . 
oh my god .  .  .   you &apos;re blushing . 
i didn &apos;t mean that the way it sounded . 
i &apos;m sorry .  that was .  .  . 
well ,  it &apos;s kind of buggy out there . 
woman friends ,  too ? 
why doesn &apos;t it scare you ? 
do you ever regret it ?  the divorce ,  i mean . 
do you ever regret not having a family ? 
but it &apos;s not the same . 
okay .  see you later . 
oh . 
i think he &apos;s running for town crier next year . 
sorry i &apos;m late .  richard called . 
fine .  they &apos;re all having a good time .  how many more shots do you have ? 
you want to eat something ? 
right now .  tell me someplace you &apos;ve been  -  -  someplace on the other side of the world .  anywhere but here . 
yes . 
i just feel like i &apos;m getting a little  .  .  .  out of control that &apos;s all .  it &apos;s kind of frightening . 
but you don &apos;t mind . 
if i &apos;ve done anything to make you think that what &apos;s happened between us is nothing new for me  -  -  is some routine  -  -  then i do apologize . 
mrs .  johnson !  mrs .  johnson !  is it true cary grant has proposed to you ? 
what about his engagement to dyan cannon ? 
where you going ? 
okay . 
about an hour ago . 
oh yeah ,  i guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio . 
you soundin &apos; like the old man now . 
shit . 
no .   well ,  yeah .   maybe just a little . 
is this hell ? 
that &apos;s what ? 
clean your mouth ,  or i will .   those boys had no business messing down there .   go places you &apos;re not meant to be  -  -  that &apos;s what you get . 
gotta be an in - ey and gotta be smooth .  if it &apos;s ragged ,  it was picked too soon .  won &apos;t ever be ripe .   second ,  it &apos;s got to have just a little give ,  here .   at the edges .   and last ,  but not very far from least .  .  .   you gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood ,  looooong sniff . 
but . 
i don &apos;t understand it .   you were my man .  since we was grasshoppas .   i always looked after you .   you had a piece of everything i had . 
they seemed alright .   bring a little life to that old building . 
have you ever been inside ? 
no really ,  let us help .   we &apos;re new in the neighborhood ,  gonna be neighbors . 
careful .   that &apos;s bad luck . 
why ? 
he probably thinks he &apos;s saving you from something .   i &apos;m sure that &apos;s what my mother thinks . 
i &apos;m here . 
here ,  find my hand .   the stairs are right near here .   i saw them .   let &apos;s just walk up there . 
we gotta jump ! 
don &apos;t worry .   it &apos;s just round the corner .  halfway down that block ,  you can &apos;t miss it .   top step of the front stairs ,  there &apos;s a loose stone .   go on ,  i ain &apos;t shitting you . 
bullshit ,  dad .   don &apos;t front me .   for once .   just tell me the truth .   i came from there ,  too . 
look ,  even if anyone found anything there ,  it &apos;s twenty years ago .   they could never connect it to us . 
i know it .   the old slaughterhouse .   hey ,  sal .   that little weasel we popped today ?   he &apos;s got something for us .   i knew he would once he thought about it . 
we didn &apos;t do nothing ,  eddie . 
and damp ,  too .   let &apos;s not forget damp . 
he was a local legend back in the  &apos;70 &apos;s .  there was a song ,  stagolee kinda deal :   &quot; this is the ballad of jimmy bones / black as night and hard as stone .  .  .  &quot; 
 &quot; like a heartbeat / like a love beat .  &quot;  listen to the di franco twins there .  just the plumbing or something ,  fool . 
illibent ?   who &apos;s club is that ?

how the fuck can i open it ? 
oh ,  shit  .  .  . 
so ,  you just got out ?

no . 
isn &apos;t that what you wanted to know ?  what i did time for ? 
i know what i am .   i don &apos;t need to have it tattooed on my shoulder . 
the difference is ,  i can have sex with someone i just met ,  someone i hardly know ,  but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself .

gino marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money ? 
and johnnie is his son ,  that &apos;s johnnie marzzone ?

if you ever get restless in portland ,  let me know . 
eventually rising to .  .  . 
okay .   i feel like i &apos;m slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they &apos;re slipping because their standards are so high ? 
wouldn &apos;t this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive ?   if needy were a turn - on ? 
nine seconds .

well -  - he calls it the bermuda triangle .   he said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again . 
he didn &apos;t mean it nasty .   he said that gettin &apos; lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do -  -  especially like that .

while i was tryin &apos; to figure out why the guy was sayin &apos; what he was sayin &apos; ,  nicky just hit him .  no matter how big a guy might be ,  nicky would take him on .  you beat nicky with fists ,  he comes back with a bat .  you beat him with a knife ,  he comes back with a gun .  and you beat him with a gun ,  you better kill him ,  because he &apos;ll keep comin &apos; back and back until one of you is dead . 
okay ,  sammy . 
when i married ginger i knew all the stories ,  but i didn &apos;t give a fuck .   &apos;i &apos;m sam rothstein ,  &apos; i said .   &apos;i can change her .  &apos;
and i didn &apos;t want any of those agents near my place . 
so ,  i &apos;m lucky .  i &apos;m not allowed to get lucky in this place ? 
he insulted billy .  and then i walked over to him politely .  .  . 
if he does it again ,  he &apos;s out for good .  i don &apos;t care what it is ,  nick ,  i &apos;m gonna ha -  i &apos;ll  -  i &apos;ll never let him in the place again . 
all right ,  ace ? 
let &apos;s say .  .  .  for instance .  .  .  i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino .  .  .  to get one of those sandwiches i like ? 
 .  .  . very difficult to get in . 
 .  .  . okay ?  i just wanna run a square joint .  that &apos;s it .  i just want my license .  i want everything nice and quiet .  that &apos;s it . 
that &apos;s all taken out of context .  okay . 
ju - just stay away from her .  it &apos;s none of your business ,  okay ?  there are certain things you don &apos;t do ,  and you know that . 
nicky was questioned in two dozen murders ,  but they always had to let him go .  there were never any witnesses . 
you want me to get out of my own fuckin &apos; town ?  ! 
nicky ,  nicky ,  you &apos;re not listenin &apos; to me .  i &apos;m here to help you .  what &apos;s the matter with you ?   you &apos;re gonna bury us both .

mr rothstein .  .  .   i &apos;m pat webb . 
before we point the dirty end of the stick at  &apos;ol don ,  uh ,  we better be sure we can prove them charges . 
well ,  could there be any position .  .  .  further down the trough ? 
hello . 
it &apos;s always been our policy  - 
i hired an old casino pal ,  billy sherbert ,  as my manager and i went to work . 
we need this guy . 
to abraham lincoln . 
 .  .  . pit bosses ,  floor managers . 
if it doesn &apos;t work out .  you know ,  if it doesn &apos;t play out ,  then what happens to me ? 
you &apos;re so wonderful .  the jewelry &apos;s not so bad ,  either . 
come on .  can i keep this one in the house ? 
well ,  that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .  she wants to come back ,  but she &apos;s afraid you &apos;re gonna whack her out . 
 .  .  . i - i .  .  .  made some mistakes and i spent some money . 
it &apos;s under .  .  . 
the good part was ,  i had amy back .  so ,  we went home ,  had the housekeeper stay over ,  put the kid to bed ,  i calmed myself down and we went to dinner .  i tried to keep things nice and civil ,  you know .   but .  .  .  hey ,  twenty - five thousand for three suits ?  that doesn &apos;t make much sense . 
yeah . 
take your  fuckin &apos; bag and get out of here ! 
i mean ,  it could get us both killed . 
i want you to let me go . 
get  -  get up ! 
she ,  she &apos;s alone .  just go .  take the gun and go into amy &apos;s . 
loose machines are right back over there . 
yeah ,  okay . 
you might regret this ,  mr rothstein . 
 .  .  . worst possible time for me . 
i mean ,  if i can &apos;t work in vegas ,  where am i gonna go ? 
ah ,  yes ,  here we are .  a little craps figures .    &#93 actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim . ] hey  -  hey .

i just wanna get out of here . 
a couple of guys ,  i owe them .  so ,  that &apos;s what i did .  i gave  &apos;em the money .   that &apos;s what i did . 
no ,  no ?  you didn &apos;t ? 
you know where she gets this from ! 
yeah ,  least you could do is return my phone calls ,  though . 
you know .  .  .  i think that you &apos;ve gotten the wrong impression about me .  i think in all fairness ,  i should explain to you what it is that i do .  for instance ,  tomorrow morning i &apos;ll get up nice and early ,  take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you ,  and ,  uh .  .  .  if you don &apos;t have my money for me ,  i &apos;ll crack your fuckin &apos; head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank .  and just about the time that i &apos;m comin &apos; out of jail ,  hopefully ,  you &apos;ll be comin &apos; out of your coma .  and guess what ?   i &apos;ll split your fuckin &apos; head open again .  because i &apos;m fuckin &apos; stupid .  i don &apos;t give a fuck about jail .   that &apos;s my business .  that &apos;s what i do .  and we know what you do ,  don &apos;t we ,  charlie ?  you fuck people out of money and get away with it . 
hey ,  you fat irish prick .  you put my fuckin &apos; money to sleep .  you go get my money ,  or i &apos;ll put your fuckin &apos; brain to sleep .

he &apos;s not here ? 
artie ! 
yeah .  everybody &apos;s talkin &apos; about it .  they &apos;re makin &apos; a big deal out of it . 
what could i say ?  i knew if i gave the wrong answer ,  i mean ,  nicky ,  ginger ,  ace ,  all of  &apos;em could &apos;ve would up gettin &apos; killed . 
so ,  i lied .  .  .  even though i knew that by lyin &apos; to gaggi ,  i could wind up gettin &apos; killed too . 
i &apos;m askin &apos; you ,  frankie ,  to keep an eye on nicky .  do it for me . 
but back then the bosses didn &apos;t give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not .  to them ,  he was a cash register .  all they had to do was ring the bell and take the money .  especially remo ,  who was a fuckin &apos; degenerate gambler who always lost . 
ace .

cold ?   cold .   how cold ? 
and only then does our noble friend realize .  .  . 
 i don &apos;t know .   um ,  he &apos;s working ,  but there &apos;s a lot of data .  maybe .  .  . another hour ? 
there &apos;s a vent shaft leading straight up . 
if it was wednesday night ,  i was workin &apos; .

 we &apos;ve gotta take out brynner &apos;s van before  they reach .  .  . 
uh ,  so head for the other end of the tunnel . 
i &apos;ll stay here and secure this position . 
now !   seal that tunnel now ! 
can i check one of these volumes out ? 
always ? 
you know ,  you &apos;ve got a nasty reputation ,  mr .  gittes .  i like that . 
it &apos;s why you attract a client like my daughter . 
my usual fee ,  plus a bonus if i come up with any results . 
wouldn &apos;t it be useful to talk to her ? 
i &apos;ve got the photographs in my office .  if they &apos;ll help you remember .  what was the argument about ? 
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune .  .  .  we were a lot closer than evelyn realized . 
well .  .  .  she &apos;s an extremely jealous person .  i didn &apos;t want her to find out about the girl . 
i &apos;ve still got a few teeth in my head ,  mr .  gittes ,  and a few friends in town . 
just find the girl . 
well ,  you don &apos;t look any the worse for wear ,  mr .  gittes ,  i must say .  .  .  where &apos;s the girl ?  .  .  . 
you &apos;ve got her ?  where ? 
what are you talking about ? 
what &apos;s that ,  curly ? 
they don &apos;t kill a guy for that . 
sure ,  as soon as we eat . 
there &apos;s seven ashtrays in this room ,  duffy . 
i &apos;d like to talk to him . 
it &apos;s too late . 
well ,  let &apos;s go . 
mrs .  mulwray ,  you don &apos;t want to run around like that . 
 .  .  . well ,  it didn &apos;t make him happy .  .  . 
you and your husband never discussed her ? 
will you need me for anything else ,  lieutenant ? 
would you like something to drink ? 
my husband &apos;s at the office . 
i should talk this over with your husband . 
nothing personal ,  mrs .  mulwray ,  i just  -  - 
mrs .  mulwray ?  .  .  .  mrs .  mulwray . 
and you weren &apos;t the slightest bit upset about it ? 
unless what ? 
i don &apos;t like the word  &apos;cheat .  &apos;
how did it happen ? 
oh ,  no .  i &apos;ve got my own car .  the creamcolored packard . 
your father is julian cross ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
you &apos;ve got one going ,  mrs .  mulwray . 
never forgave him for what ? 
what are you thinking ? 
that dam is a con job . 
what about it ? 
where are you going ? 
do ?  to who ? 
what does it look like ? 
did you get some sleep ? 
j .  j .  gittes for lieutenant escobar
yeah .  .  .  where are you taking her now ? 
miss ida sessions again .  she says you know her . 
mr .  gittes ,  sorry to keep you waiting .  these staff meetings ,  they just go on and on . 
mr .  gittes ,  you &apos;re not making a bit of sense . 
you &apos;re a married man ,  am i right ? 
have we ever met ? 
then go home and forget about it . 
mr .  yelburton will be busy for some time . 
he did or he didn &apos;t ? 
how did they get it away from him ? 
this ? 
jesus christ ,  walsh .  that &apos;s what you spent your day doing ? 
no ,  no .  she said not to call ,  her husband might answer . 
so he says you sent them ? 
course ,  she settled down nicely . 
that &apos;s for sure . 
i told my mother you weren &apos;t the one who gave me the films .  that it wasn &apos;t your fault .  but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me .  now that i know ,  i won &apos;t steal any more from you .  that &apos;s all i wanted to say .  i &apos;m going .  
will they really find work in germany ? 
what &apos;d i tell you ?  it doesn &apos;t catch fire ! 
chaplin &apos;s modern times !  right ,  toto ? 
what is it ,  what is it ?  what &apos;s the picture ? 
yes ,  it &apos;s a girl i saw at the station . 
i told you ,  the blue - eyed ones are the most difficult . 
toto ,  are you pulling my leg or something ?  how is it possible to see this television without film ? 
you  &apos;re thinner .  .  . you can tell you &apos;ve not been treated well .   . 
good morning ,  father .  it &apos;s hard on the feet ,  huh ? 
you understand now ?  you see it clearly ? 
i don &apos;t care .  i &apos;ll wait . 
elena !  .  .  . but when .  .  . 
all right ,  but i &apos;ll keep these figures ,  too ,  just in case . 
it &apos;s a saying ,  mr .  bernstein .   a new broom sweeps clean . 
gentlemen of the  &quot; enquirer &quot;  !   this has ,  i think ,  been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists  -   mr .  reilly in particular  -  who are the latest additions to our ranks .  it will make them happy to learn that the  &quot; enquirer &apos;s &quot;  circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark . 
but please ,  mr .  kane ,  don &apos;t buy any more paintings .   nine venuses already we got ,  twenty - six virgins  -  two whole warehouses full of stuff  - 
go in and ask him to hurry . 
yes .   i thought it was a good idea .  we &apos;ve covered it from the news end ,  of course . 
i &apos;m not guaranteeing a thing ,  mr .  bernstein .   you people work too fast for me !   talk about new brooms ! 
do you ,  mr .  leland ? 
isn &apos;t it wonderful ?   such a party ! 
if you hadn &apos;t come along and protected me when you did ,  i &apos;d have killed them fellows . 
not to me .   but you will let that cop go home with mr .  kane ,  won &apos;t you ? 
hello ,  mr .  leland . 
i suppose he &apos;s fixing it up  -  i know i &apos;d never get that through . 
maybe you can do it and maybe you can &apos;t ,  mr .  kane . 
let him finish ,  charles . 
emily ! 
they won &apos;t do anything to junior ,  darling .   anonymous letter writers  -    i &apos;ve got guards in front of the house ,  and i &apos;m going to arrange  - 
charles ,  if you don &apos;t listen to reason ,  it may be too late  - 
you can &apos;t blackmail me ,  rogers ,  you can &apos;t  - 
oh ! 
what happened to the singing ?  you &apos;re not in a show ,  are you ? 
yes ,  i would .   that &apos;s why i asked . 
don &apos;t tell me your toothache is bothering you again ? 
i mean in new york . 
what you want me to want ,  you mean .  what you &apos;ve decided i ought to have  -  what you &apos;d want if you were me .  but you &apos;ve never given me anything that  - 
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re sorry . 
she doesn &apos;t know ,  mrs .  kane .   she just sent it  -  because i made her see it wouldn &apos;t be smart for her not to send it . 
get dr .  corey . 
do you like poetry ,  raymond ? 
no ,  i don &apos;t ,  mr .  kane . 
first of all ,  i will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the  &quot; enquirer .  &quot; 
charlie ,  it &apos;s just no go .   we can &apos;t agree anymore .   i wish you &apos;d let me go to chicago . 
i don &apos;t think so ,  brad .   we &apos;ve just had word that the president is out of danger .   it seems i didn &apos;t kill him after all . 
there &apos;s no reason why this  -  this savage personal note  - 
that &apos;s all right .   what are you going to do about emily ? 
maybe you could remember something that  - 
i guess maybe i &apos;m not as hard to see through as i think .   anyway ,  i never even answered his letter .  maybe i should have .   i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years .   he hadn &apos;t finished it when she left him  -  he never finished it  -  he never finished anything .   of course ,  he built it for her  - 
yes and no . 
why don &apos;t you people let me alone ?  i &apos;m minding my own business .   you mind yours . 
how did you meet him ? 
i did a lot of singing after that .  i sang for charlie  -   i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour  -  the teachers got that ,  i didn &apos;t  - 
he was in love with me .   but he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us  -  and he lost the election and that norton woman divorced him . 
they haven &apos;t been tough on me .   i just lost my money .   but when i compare these last ten years with the twenty i spent with him  - 
don &apos;t you think i do ?   you say you &apos;re going down to xanadu ? 
she &apos;s plastered ,  isn &apos;t she ? 
i &apos;ll come down in a week or so and see her again .   say ,  you might be able to help me .   when she used to talk about kane  -  did she ever happen to say anything  -  about rosebud ? 
that &apos;s your lung .  by this time ,  your lung looks like this . 
thanks .  have a good one . 
fifty - five . 
if you &apos;re going to drink it in here ,  i &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d not bother the customers . 
yeah ,  but not in here . 
randal graves - scourge of the video renter . 
you might be let down .  i &apos;m not a hermaphrodite . 
dick . 
nobody !  i swear ! 
it &apos;s not what you think . 
no . 
you don &apos;t have anything to do with it . 
i had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on .  when i say i don &apos;t want to get married ,  i mean just that .  i don &apos;t want to marry anybody .  not for years . 
you &apos;re serious .  you want to date again . 
it &apos;s just the shock of seeing me after three years .  believe me ,  you &apos;ll get over it . 
how about the caitlin bree walk on the boardwalk ,  then get naked somewhere kind of private date ? 
jerk .  here i am ,  throwing myself at you ,  succumbing to your wily charms ,  and you call me a slut ,  in so many words . 
he &apos;s not invited . 
then who operated the store ? 
are you open ? 
using filthy language in front of the customers .  .  .  you should both get fired . 
who are you to make assessments ? 
are you open ? 
my point is that you &apos;re a clerk ,  paid to do a job .  you can &apos;t just do anything you want while you &apos;re working . 
i &apos;m gonna break your fucking head !  you fucking jerkoff ! 
all right ,  now if you &apos;re really feeling dangerous tonight ,  then smokey and the bandit three is the movie you must rent . 
i work in a shitty video store .  i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie . 
pack of cigarettes .   cute cat .  what &apos;s its name ? 
someone jammed gum in the locks . 
seven months . 
eight and a half . 
she was supposed to meet brad michaelson in a bedroom .  she picked the wrong one .  she had no idea i was even at the party . 
allan harris . 
because there was a lot of good in our relationship . 
empire had the better ending :  luke gets his hand cut off ,  and finds out vader &apos;s his father; han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett .   it ends on such a down note .  and that &apos;s life - a series of down endings .  all jedi had was a bunch of muppets . 
more or less . 
exactly .  in order to get it built quickly and quietly they &apos;d hire anybody who could do the job .  do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main ?   all they know is killing and white uniforms . 
she &apos;s in here ? 
what &apos;s he looking for ? 
perfect dozen . 
oh ,  it &apos;s great .  you step into this little booth and there &apos;s this window between you and this naked woman ,  and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks . 
it &apos;s not really anyone per se ,  it &apos;s more of separate groupings . 
how ?  when ? 
you hardly knew her ! 
i &apos;m not taking you to this funeral . 
an embolism in a pool . 
that &apos;s nothing compared to how my cousin walter died . 
shut the hell up . 
you know . 
you knocked the fucking casket over ,  for chrissakes ! 
let me borrow your car . 
you know what ?  i don &apos;t think i care for your rationale . 
that &apos;s stretching it .  you &apos;re not being asked to slay children or anything . 
what ? 
i like to expand my horizons . 
no way ! 
i didn &apos;t think they even enforced this . 
you &apos;re happy to get a fine ? 
who eats cock ? 
there &apos;s no lights back there . 
what ?  what &apos;s with you ?  you haven &apos;t said anything for like twenty minutes .  what the hell is your problem ? 
have some chips; you &apos;ll feel better . 
you should shit or get off the pot . 
it &apos;s true .  you &apos;ll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand ,  never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is . 
make them change . 
like ten after . 
i &apos;ll call you .  let you know . 
to say the least . 
just the paper . 
i &apos;d say about sixty ,  seventy - tops . 
he &apos;s got those love handles . 
caitlin bree .  yeah ? 
pretty girl ,  about this girl &apos;s height -  dark hair - gorgeous body ? 
noinch ,  noinch ,  noinch - smoking weed ,  smoking weed !  doing coke !   drinking beers !   a pack of wraps ,  my good man .  it &apos;s time to kick back ,  drink some beers ,  and smoke some weed ! 
we get off about the same time every night .  we should hang out .   you get high ? 
wanna come to this party tonight ?  there &apos;s gonna be some pussy there ,  man ! 
what the hell is that ?  resting his eyes !  it &apos;s not like he &apos;s some goddamned air traffic controller ! 
here .  now leave me alone . 
what were you doing ? 
who &apos;s fighting ?  why are you so defensive ? 
how much money did you leave up there ? 
and i actually date you ? 
like you said - she snowballed him . 
you sucked that guy &apos;s dick ? 
i did understand !  i understand that you slept with three different guys ,  and that &apos;s all you said . 
what the hell is that anyway ,   &quot; something like thirty - six ?  &quot;  does that include me ? 
i feel sick . 
what did he say ? 
thanks .  i thought i was gonna have to go to the hospital . 
here you go . 
what are you talking about ? 
he only speaks russian ? 
he really wants to play metal ? 
to an asian design major . 
holy shit !  she told you about that !   buddy of mine worked there .  said he watched the whole thing .  they used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it . 
you hope what feels good ? 
and .  .  .  he told you all of this ? 
i know .  i &apos;ve been here since eleven . 
i would &apos;ve went to big choice ,  but the tape i want is right there on the wall . 
i just talked to her on monday .  we still hang out on weekends . 
next time you &apos;re like watching mtv ,  y &apos; know ,  like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out .   i mean ,  hey ,  we could be home watching some righteous pornos . 
if i don &apos;t meet up with them ,  you can come and pick me up by nightfall . 
surprise me . 
looks like the tower .   it &apos;s a bad climb . 
go on ,  fetch . 
where are you ,  walker ? 
glad you could drop in . 
i think it &apos;s out .   no big deal .  it &apos;s that old football injury . 
what the hell are you doing here ?  ! 
you &apos;re gone now !   i don &apos;t climb with people i can &apos;t trust .   why &apos;d you come up ,  to prove something ? 
take the gun . 
two .  .  . 
oh ,  my god !   i can &apos;t recognize the face ,  but the butt does look vaguely familiar .  
enough . 
maybe i can help .  let &apos;s see .  .  .  if one night i got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note ,  and stayed away for months ,  i think what i &apos;d want to do is come up with a well thought - out reason . 
i know .  .  . 
then turn it off ,  gabe ,  because it doesn &apos;t get any better . 
excuse me ? 
did i miss something ? 
that &apos;s not the issue here ,  those people are .   he can &apos;t do it alone . 
looking for hal .   oh my god ,  i heard someone kick the door open .  .  . you came back . 
before it crashed ,  they dumped three cases filled with millions .  they &apos;re using hal for a bird dog .  once they find the money ,  hal &apos;s dead .   so get on your radio ,  contact frank ,  have him pick you up ,  then contact the state police ,  the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here !   do it jessie . 
let &apos;s be creative . 
a simple yes or no would have done . 
take the rope . 
fine ,  it shouldn &apos;t bother your conscience . 
look here ,  the mountain man .  you &apos;re walker ,  right ? 
your mouth &apos;s writing a check your ass can &apos;t cash ,  but if ya wanna buy some life ,  bring me the money . 
it &apos;s up there ,  on the tower . 
murdering ,  motherfucker .  .  . 
you said there was a way across . 
got to be comb bluff . 
right . 
what the hell are you doing -  - 
kill me ?   christ we &apos;re partners in this ! 
get off my back ,  qualen ! 
is it set ?

rich .  .  . 
i &apos;d like to have a word with you .  this is agent matheson ,  fbi . 
appreciate it . 
i don &apos;t like you should do what you done .  and i &apos;m not your brother no more and wouldn &apos;t want to be . 
been cured ,  yeah ,  that was read out to us .  the inspector read all that out to us .  he said it was a very good way . 
good evening ,  sir . 
your wife ,  sir ?  has she gone away ? 
look ,  sir .  i &apos;m sorry to have troubled you .  i think i ought to be going ,  sir .  julian bars the way . 
hullo .

what would you like to know ,  sir ? 
you &apos;ve not been to school all week ,  son . 
hi .  hi .  hi ,  there my pee and em .  all three look up startled . 
no time ,  no time ,  yes .  sit ,  sit ,  sit .  alex sits next to him . 
it &apos;s alright ,  thank you . 
do you still feel suicidal ? 
all right ,  no more picking on dim ,  brother .  that &apos;s part of the new way . 
she came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace ,  and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that i would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in - out ,  real savage .  but quick as a shot came the sickness ,  like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest .  alex retching .  minister rises . 
where is he now ,  sir ? 
what job and how much ? 
helping you ,  sir ? 
certainly ,  sir .  what do they call you at home ? 
that &apos;s right ,  dad they did a great job on my gulliver ,  i &apos;m completely reformed .

crime ? 
no ,  sir . 
you &apos;re absolutely right ,  sir . 
the next morning i was taken to the ludovico medical facility ,  outside the town centre ,  and i felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old staja ,  as you always will when you leave a place you &apos;ve like gotten used to .  chief guard briskly leads the way for alex and escort .  they move into reception hall where the doctor stands . 
are you referring to the background score ? 
just part of hospital routine . 
no .  .  .  i &apos;m going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them alright ? 
now then ,  each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture .  you &apos;ll tell me what you think the person would say .  alright ? 
how many did i get right ? 
very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death -  like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness .  one of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death ,  a sense of stifling and drowning ,  and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees .  alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket . 
oh - hhh !  !  !  go on ,  do me in you bastard cowards .  i don &apos;t want to live anyway ,  not in a stinking world like this . 
i &apos;ve done my best ,  have i not ? 
no father .  it &apos;s nothing like that ,  father .  it &apos;s about this new thing they &apos;re all talking about .  about this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again . 
instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul . 
don &apos;t read it  -  sign it ! 
yes ,  i heard .  d &apos;you know what time he got in last night ? 
well ,  what &apos;s the matter lad ,  are you feeling alright ? 
cram criminals together and what do you get  -  concentrated criminality .  .  .  crime in the midst of punishment . 
sixth is faster . 
but bowery &apos;s fine ,  if that &apos;s what you want . 
the ride is free . 
keep it .   go wild .   have a party . 
you like being a lawyer ? 
sure .   i &apos;m starting an 800 hotline .   caught part of your phone call .   and even if i hadn &apos;t ,  there &apos;s the dark pinstripe ,  armani ,  elegant ,  not too hip ,  which rules out advertising ,  plus a top - of - the - line briefcase that you live out of ,  looks like bottega .  .  . 
 .  .  . he &apos;s two floors below you . 
where are you ,  what floor ? 
he doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re up there !   just stay right where you are !   call the police ! 
you still carrying passengers ? 
get outta here !   you and louis ? 
one more thing .   if by some chance i get this wrong .  .  . tell dmitri i &apos;m sorry . 
cabbie drove around all night .   three people got killed .

mind if i time you ?   what do i get if you &apos;re wrong ?   a free ride ? 
you on some kind of work plan ? 
bullshit .   you probably know the light schedules ,  too .   listen ,  i &apos;m in town tonight on a closing .   five stops ,  one night .   i gotta catch a six a . m .  flight .   i got five stops to make ,  see some friends ,  collect some signatures .   why don &apos;t you hang with me ? 
he fell on my cab !   from up th - th - there . 
you listening to me ? 
chopin prelude .   stodgy ,  but nice .   here &apos;s the deal .   i didn &apos;t want you involved in this .   still breathing ?  but now that you are ,  we have to make the best of it ,  max .   improvise .   life is that way .   adapt to your environment .   survive .   darwin .    &quot; shit happens .  &quot;   the i ching .   whatever .  roll with it . 
please .   don &apos;t do anything . 
i can &apos;t believe this . 
i had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes .   where &apos;s the button ?   under the dash ? 
what you mean ,  no ? 
show up for what ? 
i &apos;ll just hold onto it for you .   in case they check . 
no client has ever seen my face ,  and i intend to keep it that way .   besides ,  if he decides to put a bullet in my head ,  i don &apos;t wanna be there for it . 
vincent .   don &apos;t make me do this .  don &apos;t make me get people killed . 
in case he asks . 
head towards union station . 
look in the mirror .    .  .  . piss - ant paper towels .  .  . a bottle of 409 .  .  . saving up for goin &apos; to the comoros .   how much you got saved ? 
jerry< / u> ?   you didn &apos;t show last night .   first time ever .   had me worried ,  boy . 
saved you last night &apos;s ,  too . 
i don &apos;t see the connection . 
the president &apos;s in europe .  tomorrow he &apos;ll be in turkey .  right along this fault line .   they launched the space shuttle yesterday . 
what was your horse &apos;s name ? 
what took so long ?   you were in there all day . 
if you &apos;re worried about the president ,  call and warn him about the space shuttle . 
nothing scary there .   sorry . 
you want something to drink ? 
if my universe had a hub .  .  . 
what are you doing ? 
shoot . 
did you see the van back there ? 
never mind .   you &apos;d think i was making it up . 
right here .   in the 7th street subway station . 
they don &apos;t break in the summer !  do you know what building is right over this spot ?   harriman tower .  their sub - basement was flooded !  he didn &apos;t die in a pool .   call the coroner in rhode island !   ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated ! 
oh ,  christ ,  here it comes .   look ,  i know you think i &apos;m crazy .   i don &apos;t think i am ,  but .  .  . 
yeah .  .  .   would you ,  i mean ,  could you love me then ?   if i was normal .   maybe ? 
after you .   it &apos;s okay .   i &apos;m the one who left it here . 
why not ,  jerry< / u> ? 
liza ? 
geronimo is down . 
don &apos;t die on me ,  jerry .   okay ? 
do i know you ? 
then screw you .   i &apos;ll rot . 
can i ask you something ? 
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president ? 
what i &apos;m about to tell you is partially documented .   the freedom of information act saw to that .  but much more of it isn &apos;t .   for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear ,  i &apos;m going to share  -  -  secrets  -  -  with you .  repeat any of it and you &apos;ll simply bestow the title of  &apos;paranoid &apos; upon yourself . 
m . k .  ultra was terminated in 1973 .  but not the research .  it was renamed .   ex catcher . 
these things you &apos;re talking about .  you did them to jerry ? 
i &apos;m still listening . 
so ,  you doing anything tonight ? 
night after that ? 
federal bureau of investigation . 
yes . 
tell him i &apos;m on vacation .   that i won &apos;t be back for two weeks . 
it makes perfect sense .   field work is not our oeuvre . 
i want to believe you ,  too . 
what gave me away ? 
jonas builds assassins for a living .   several of whom may be in place already .   we &apos;d like to kill a few birds with one stone . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  miss arroway ,  not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation ,  at this point in your career it &apos;d be tantamount to suicide . 
and only two probabilities :   one :  there is intelligent life in the universe but they &apos;re so far away you &apos;ll never contact it in your lifetime  -  - 
two :   there &apos;s nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you &apos;d be wasting your time . 
peter sends his regards . 
ellie .  .  . 
do you have a minute  -  -   ? 
i &apos;m asking for your help ,  david .   i want to go .   they &apos;ll need someone relatively young ,  unattached  -  -  and probably a scientist .   as the president &apos;s science advisor you have enormous weight .  .  .  i &apos;m asking if you &apos;ll support my candidacy . 
ellie .  .  .  we both know that if i was any kind of a man ,  i never would &apos;ve entered this race .   that i would have told the president straight out :   helen ,  eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass .  .  .  but she &apos;s got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together .   that more then anyone else on the planet ,  she &apos;s earned this .   and that she should be the one to go because she &apos;s the best we have .   but that &apos;s not who i am .   i like to think it &apos;s who i might &apos;ve been if things had gone a different way; that i might have been worthy ,  really worthy of what i &apos;ve been given .  .  .   you do what you have to do .   and in the end ,  as with everything ,  it comes down to power .   and it isn &apos;t fair .  .  . 
what &apos;s the status of the decryption effort ? 
what ? 
j39 z186 .  .  .  ? 
hydrogen times pi .  .  .   got it .   strong sucker . 
ellie .   pulsar ? 
i &apos;m saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive .  .  . 
pardon me ,  but you can &apos;t do  -  -   ! 
so why don &apos;t you admit what by your own standards must be the truth :  that this experience simply didn &apos;t happen . 
talk to him . 
could we hear god ? 
pensacola . 
 .  .  .  life is unspeakably rare .   so whenever we do find another civilization ,  especially one that &apos;s .  .  .  struggling .  .  .  we send a message .   sometimes we can offer help .   sometimes we can &apos;t .   but we always try .   life is simply too precious not to . 
if i knew you any better i &apos;d say that doesn &apos;t sound like you . 
a sunrise and a sunset every forty -  five minutes . 
it looks like pixie dust .  .  .   kent would &apos;ve given anything to see this .   david ,  too . 
as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido  -  -  for backup purposes ,  of course .  we &apos;ve been right behind you the entire time .   you see my problem :   i couldn &apos;t appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn &apos;t stand for it .   so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract .   of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired ,  wholly - owned subsidiaries  -  - 
ellie .   arroway . 
it &apos;s like the pre - copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth ,  or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made .   i mean .  .  .  try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us  -  -  then imagine trying to explain .  .  .  i dunno ,  a microwave oven  -  -  to someone even a hundred years ago  -  -  i mean the basic concepts didn &apos;t exist .  .  . 
peter  -  -  if you can get him to do that for me he &apos;d obviously do the same for you  -  -  we could  -  -   ! 
peter .  .  .  what is going on ?   has everyone gone completely insane ? 
if you came back .  .  .  you &apos;d only be four years older  -  -  but over 50 years would have passed on earth . 
i thought it was well - written .  heart - felt .   and a little bit naive .  .  .  but that &apos;s just the enemy &apos;s perspective . 
and yet you &apos;re willing to die for this cause ,  the one thing that &apos;s given your life a sense of purpose .  don &apos;t you see the contradiction here  -  -   ? 
 .  .  .  another question i would ask would be a very simple one .   how did you do it ?   how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves ? 
what ? 
i &apos;m assuming you read my deposition . 
i don &apos;t think you understand .  we made a deal  -  -  - 
but i made this arrangement  -  - 
i &apos;m lucky i got a broom .  work up top .  real easy job .  man ,  it &apos;s gonna be hot down in that ditch .

i hate this .  .  . 
he can &apos;t phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you .   did you give him an approval ? 
cellulite .   what do you say i blindfold you and take you to the gym .   aerobics with housewives .  .  . 
you parked right behind him .   the one i noticed earlier .   i didn &apos;t say anything ,  i thought he &apos;d leave .  just take a look . 
are you staying long ?   shall i shut the door ?   make your coffee ?   make the beds ? 
we &apos;ll get the paramedics .  .  . 
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects . 
the first two murders . 
daryll lee cullum ,  he wrote that book ,  he wanted the lady to have it .   they won &apos;t let him send it to her ,  so i &apos;m getting out ,  he asks me to deliver it in person ,  he says ,  put it on her pillow .   it has all about how he tried to kill her . 
she &apos;s supposed to have it . 
i will .   i &apos;ll call you ,  daryll ,  and talk to you about it after i &apos;ve read it .   right now i have a question .  .  .  peter kurten . 
kill me ,  peter ,  do it ,  now . 
who is this ? 
would you want to work with us on this ? 
how do you know that ? 
she probably let him in the door without a thought .   where are their mothers ?  !   where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight ? 
he &apos;ll get caught .   if he has a plan that &apos;ll be what trips him up .  .  . 
helen  -  -  let go .   you &apos;ve got to let go . 
why can &apos;t i drive home ?   i will .  you .   look at you .   you< / u> need a ride home .   and you don &apos;t even know it . 
tell me what to do ! 
you know how to use this ? 
just get out of your vehicle .  .  . 
how come you &apos;re so up on dr .  hudson ? 
answer it . 
i like women like that ! 
absolutely . 
ruben ,  my god ,  i ought to put you on report . 
you messed with the scene . 
how about i put nikko on it ? 
so .   do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information ? 
so what have we got ? 
what the hell you need her for ? 
i didn &apos;t want the illigals ,  i wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor .   what &apos;s keeping those bums at immigration ?   nightmare in here .  .  . 
that was bundy .   he killed forty of them ,  identical ,  long hair ,  parted in the middle ,  alike as barbie dolls .    .  .  . this is hopeless .   let &apos;s try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and tv hookups and broadcast a warning ? 
she &apos;s in no shape to give her statement tonight .  .  . 
 .  .  .  third bay area woman has been strangled ,  but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer .   lt .  thomas quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes ,  unless new evidence .  .  . 
she knows i &apos;m catholic !   she never mentioned divorce !   not once ! 
see ,  now you &apos;ve annoyed her .   you know she doesn &apos;t like you to touch me .   does she ,  widdle wee fing !   wuhve you so much !   did you feed her ? 
what !  ?  they brought the car here ? 
have you seen his penis ? 
i thought that was you ,  up there . 
the traffic .  .  .  where is everyone ?  they &apos;ve all gone away . 
do you want a cigarette ?  i started to smoke at the hospital .  it &apos;s rather stupid of me . 
it &apos;s much worse now .  you noticed that ,  did you ?  the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didn &apos;t understand .  there seemed to be ten times as much traffic . 
i &apos;ve found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic .  i like to look at it .  yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour .   &quot; anywhere &quot;  ,  i said . 
oh yes .  i thought he was a medical photographer ,  doing some sort of accident research .  he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash . 
and you had sex with all of these men in cars ?  only in cars ? 
can you drive ? 
what is it ? 
do you live here ?  with seagrave ? 
what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology ?  i thought that was your project . 
first you tell me to do what i want to ,  then you tell me to stop . 
what ? 
so ,  we &apos;ll meet every tuesday and friday .  and if you have any kind of emergency ,  you can page me . 
maybe ,  though .  maybe it would work .  i could throw you an engagement party maybe . 
things have been kind of stressful lately . 
everything &apos;s ready for tomorrow night -  - except the artillery . 
that settles it .  i &apos;m never leaving . 
you &apos;re slowing . 
do we have to talk wedding details ? 
you did the right thing . 
will you get time off to do that ? 
oh no . 
oh ,  ok ,  well ,  better to choose the table cloths first anyway . 
must you walk so quickly ? 
i &apos;m going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded . 
letty ,  you should be in bed . 
it had this red spot on its back . 
if you feel lonely ,  or need to talk ,  all you have to do is say so . 
you can only do what feels best to you now . 
what are you looking to read ? 
he asked me to marry him . 
no . 
i &apos;m not allowed to see you anymore . 
what &apos;s my rap ? 
you &apos;re right .  i guess i was projecting .  what i should have said is ,   &quot; it &apos;s a good thing i love you .  &quot; 
where to ? 
did i get spaghetti sauce on my face ? 
michael . 
just promise you &apos;ll love me even if i end up in a job where i have to wear a blue polyester cap . 
what ? 
don &apos;t upset my mom .      don &apos;t you upset my mom . 
i guess we need to talk . 
i love you so much . 
don &apos;t you have a magic trick or something to make this easier ? 
can i put these here for tonight ? 
but what about that math project ? 
you know what i think we need ?  martinis .  how about martinis to celebrate ? 
exactly .  it &apos;s time to make decisions . 
what &apos;s so urgent ?    you &apos;ve got me worried . 
oh ,  none .  none .  i completely understand what was going on . 
look ,  gail ,  i &apos;ve been a good teacher . 
all tapped out . 
what are you doing ? 
you want the tapes for yourself .      you &apos;re going to sell them . 
i can &apos;t bring the bureau into this .     if i do the tapes become evidence . 
jesus .    what kind of fbi agent are you ? 
where &apos;s your brother ? 
you sure ?  i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily .  special blend .  can &apos;t find anything like it in the states . 
business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property . 
they &apos;re gonna be what ? 
oh frankie ,  what &apos;s this i hear about your brother ? 
either you are incredibly brave ,  or incredibly stupid .  which one is it ? 
i &apos;ve got to tell you ,  mr .  bonanno ,  this guy &apos;s an idiot .  how he &apos;s lived this long is a mystery . 
what kind of business ? 
not a good idea .  someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you .  raymond ,  you &apos;ll steal one . 
forget the money !  we &apos;ve got bigger problems than the money right now . 
do they come with batteries ? 
did you know about bastaldi &apos;s deal with zammito ? 
you &apos;re sure ? 
you call being bastaldi &apos;s lap dog better ? 
don &apos;t bullshit me . 
i just thought that -  - 
but we ain &apos;t had nothing to eat all day boss . 
the map said to go left . 
they don &apos;t have a wine list . 
there &apos;s an exterior alarm system .  there &apos;s also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector .  the control panel is in the bedroom . 
they don &apos;t serve wine here . 
don &apos;t tell me to be cool !  we were supposed to be in and out .  in and out !  in the last twenty four hours we &apos;ve managed to get the mafia .  .  .  the fbi .  .  .  the chicago police department and a group of latin gang members after us .  i haven &apos;t left out anyone ,  have i ?   i don &apos;t think so ,  because we &apos;ve already pissed off everyone in the fuckin &apos; city ! 
there &apos;s no reason to be abusive .  you &apos;re projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism . 
no .    how much ? 
fuck you ,  grease - ball ! 
yeah . 
how do we know what room she &apos;s in ? 
the money isn &apos;t here . 
you &apos;re not helping . 
algeria . 
and how do we do that ? 
i wasn &apos;t expecting this many of you .  i &apos;ve got a few sleeping bags you can use . 
i don &apos;t want anything .  i just wanted to say .  .  .  that i may have .  .  .  overreacted a little the other day . 
oh really ?  thanks .  i thought it was a sewing machine .  what the hell is it doing here ? 
do you think you are a real master ? 
you think you &apos;ve been teaching me all these years from the manual ?  you couldn &apos;t even decipher the symbols ! 
li mu bai !   the famous warrior ?  why would he give his sword to sir te ? 
you &apos;re not married ,  are you ? 
about you and li mu bai ? 
you ,  sister .  .  . 
you &apos;re working together to set me up !   i &apos;m leaving ! 
stop it !   you don &apos;t deserve the green destiny . 
give it back ! 
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  i guessed wrong .   i though you were a han . 
your father &apos;s men are still looking for you .   they &apos;re still out there ,  circling closer . 
good .   and how are you ? 
i don &apos;t understand .   how can you part with it ?   it has always been with you . 
come with me to peking .   you can give the sword to sir te yourself .  it &apos;ll be just like old times . 
i didn &apos;t think she &apos;d dare come back to peking ! 
no ,  i &apos;d already sent them home .  you can blame me for losing the sword ,  but please trust that i &apos;ll get it back soon using my own methods . 
what do you mean ?   didn &apos;t you come back here for it ? 
then ,  why did you come ? 
i admit ,  getting it back makes me realize how much i &apos;d missed it . 
giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons ,  full of corruption .  .  .  i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble . 
save your strength . 
you &apos;ve always been so good to li mu bai and me .   please accept our thanks . 
but the sword could be in his compound . 
sure it coulda .   funboy &apos;s not here ,  neither is t - bird  -  -  none of top dollar &apos;s number ones . 
whatever it is ,  the answer &apos;s no ,  eddie .   i &apos;m too busy tonight . 
and i say i &apos;m dead .  .  .  and i move . 
you died ,  man .   i can &apos;t believe it but here you are .   last year ,  you and your girlfriend  -  - 
they couldn &apos;t do anything for me . 
don &apos;t interfere . 
mom  -  -  ? 
at least it finally stopped raining . 
you look like a rock star without a job . 
mister funboy . 
i remember him !   here ,  gabriel .  .  .  here kitty .  .  .  gabriel .  .  .  is he still yours ? 
you &apos;re not a cop ,  either .   what do you want him for ? 
you want those assholes ,  you want top dollar . 
sooner or later ,  my action were destined to bring me a genuine fury .   and it turned out to be you .  at last .   i appreciate your abilities as few mortals can .  that &apos;s why i desire them . 
you need to learn to mind your own business or you &apos;ll never get where you think you &apos;re going . 
did you see an animal of any kind ?  did you see a bird ? 
do you know of spirit assassins ?  you do know the dead can rise ?  properly motivated ,  of course . 
who got himself what ? 
i had heard something like this .   describe it for me .   the  &quot; hit &quot;  . 
i know of no one .   but even if there is ,  i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with ? 
oh cut the shit ,  kathryn . 
nothing . 
you promise not to say anything ? 
excuse me .  excuse me ! 
this is my favorite part .   even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating .  he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention .  every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it . 
about what ? 
look ,  i didn &apos;t mean to give you a hard time . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but you &apos;re not my type . 
yes ,  but only when it &apos;s mutual .  and this is far from mutual . 
i can &apos;t .  i &apos;m seeing a friend . 
okay ? 
am i bothering you ? 
i just came to say goodbye . 
back to the city .  i may take off to europe for the rest of the summer .  i just can &apos;t handle it around here . 
how am i a hypocrite ? 
hi . 
it &apos;s not you ,  it &apos;s me .  i &apos;m completely fucked up . 
but you knew this was important to me . 
 -  wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me . 
blaine ,  if i knew who it was that person wouldn &apos;t be alive right now . 
it would make sense .  mcconnell hates me .  i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year . 
what do you mean ? 
i think he &apos;s telling the truth valmont .  greg couldn &apos;t write a grocery list let alone a letter . 
those are my letters ! 
what was that ? 
does your mother know ? 
so ?  don &apos;t you want to make ronald a happy pappy ?  practice makes perfect ,  cecile .  my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible . 
but i thought high school is only four years . 
don &apos;t you want to change that ?

kathryn .  did you hit her ? 
i &apos;m so glad to have met you at last .  you &apos;re just as nice as amy told me you were .   i hope you &apos;ll come to see us . 
it &apos;s perfectly normal for a child to dream .  i can see how a sensitive little girl ,  finding this portrait ,  would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend .  that image dwells only in her imagination ,  and that image can go as quickly as it was born . 
no dear .  i don &apos;t know them ,  but i &apos;ve heard about them . 
edward will give you your breakfast ,  amy . 
where &apos;d you get this ,  darling ? 
no .   it &apos;s not that .   it &apos;s because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves  -  -  imagine things .  i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals .  i saw what happened to irena with her cat people . 
you &apos;re shouting at me . 
that &apos;s the farren house . 
it &apos;s late ,  mommy  -  -  you haven &apos;t forgotten my birthday party . 
is that my birthday cake ?  may i see ? 
why didn &apos;t you run after them ? 
and who did the voice belong to ? 
now look ,  this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  i &apos;m sick of this sort of thing . 
i &apos;m sorry .  daddy and mommy are a little upset . 
it isn &apos;t a secret .  she plays with me .  she plays with me in the garden all the time .  right out there in the garden ,  she does ! 
yes ,  she was afraid .  she said there was someone who wanted to kill me . 
can &apos;t you get it ,  darling ? 
light shining) in her eyes) throw sea weeds into the flames ,  and the fire turns blue ! 
no ,  i don &apos;t think that &apos;s very much fun .  let &apos;s play house instead .   you be the friend who comes to see me .   i &apos;ll show you my children . 
merry christmas ,  irena .   i brought you a present . 
i shall wear it in my hair ! 
merry christmas . 
getting the yard all fixed up for your party ,  amy .  you &apos;d better hurry and get yourself fixed up too .

the ring up to him) what &apos;s a mourning ring ? 
but i only came to give back the ring . 
the headless horseman  -  - 
he &apos;ll let me stay ,  mrs .  farren .  he &apos;ll let me stay . 
you didn &apos;t even open my present and i &apos;m your daughter . 
it &apos;s some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound . 
everything all right down there at the school ,  mr .  reed ? 
but there was nothing ,  no one in the garden . 
a bite .  .  .  where &apos;d you get bitten ? 
that bite healed up quickly .  it &apos;s been about three weeks ? 
sounds all stress related .  your teeth may feel sharper if you &apos;re grinding them at night .  you don &apos;t seem hairy to me .  is that all ? 
how about i give you a make - over ?  you &apos;ll feel better about yourself .  you &apos;re actually pretty ,  you &apos;re just not bringing it out . 
can &apos;t you get contacts ? 
can you believe she fuckin &apos; bit me ? 
why did gregory ask me out ?  i mean he &apos;s cute  -  -  he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea . 
i don &apos;t see anything .  maybe just a little . 
and then ? 
i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses . 
i don &apos;t know much about him .  how do you know if a guy is decent ? 
what the hell is the tampon test ? 
what did he say ? 
you might want to tape your nipples down next time .  it &apos;s really distracting . 
frida ,  this is a bad time .  we &apos;re having sex and george actually answered the phone . 
i &apos;ve been here .  what day is it ? 
oh my god jennifer .  i should go to confession . 
get rid of him ! 
how could i ?  i &apos;m helping you clean up mark &apos;s remains and you ask how could i cheat on george ? 
you expecting someone ? 
i tried to kill myself  -  -  earlier .  it doesn &apos;t work .  i think i need silver bullets .  so i got depressed and when i &apos;m depressed i clean . 
i &apos;m just afraid i &apos;ll hurt peter .  i think i love him . 
i thought you and george were getting married . 
god i hope so .  hey can i call you later ?  peter &apos;s still here .  he &apos;s in the shower . 
so there i was ,  hanging from the edge of a bridge ,  when my mom said ,   &quot; son ,  you got into harvard !  &quot;  it took three of them to pull me back !  frida keeps eating . 
oh come on .  knock it off . 
you &apos;re just saying that to get into my apartment and then you &apos;re hoping that &apos;ll turn into something else . 
you look different .  i mean you look good . 
these guys aren &apos;t the kind that &apos;ll take an apology .  they &apos;re the kind that &apos;ll break my thumbs . 
when &apos;s the last time you saw him ? 
you wanna get some coffee ? 
it &apos;s stupid . 
we lived in northern minnesota .  she went for a walk one night and they never found her body  -  -  just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them .  then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area . 
i &apos;ve read scripts about detectives ,  but never met one .  must be wild . 
cool .  i don &apos;t get guys who wear boxers .  my ex wore boxers .  i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up . 
what are they for ? 
yes ,  sort of .  i mean no ,  not really . 
i knew you wouldn &apos;t kill me . 
you say you killed a man and don &apos;t remember it .  couldn &apos;t you have had sex and not remember it ?  it &apos;s sexual .  why did you choose  &quot; eating him &quot;  as the method of killing ? 
seems you were the last to see carlton alive .  and the last to see gregory alive . 
she &apos;s just insecure .  once you get to know her she &apos;s fabulous . 
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along ? 
what the fuck are you following me for ?  i &apos;m not a suspect here . 
what kind of animal ? 
how long have you been here ? 
what &apos;s he doing here ? 
please ,  they &apos;ll kill me .  .  . 
what is this place ? 
you wont regret this ,  sir . 
you typed this report ? 
how can i submit this ? 
where are we going ? 
they didn &apos;t have faces . 
but .  .  .   how long has this been happening ? 
i see .   the verdict ,  yes .  .  . 
someones after me . 
what does she say ?   the woman . 
horrible .  .  . 
if you would only take this ,  inject it in your brain ,  everything would be much clearer . 
i can &apos;t do that .   it &apos;s dangerous .  what about my parents ?   do you know where i can find them ? 
they barely talk anymore . 
now ,  remember  -  -  keep it simple . 
i &apos;m not certain about .  .  . 
now when she comes in ,  we &apos;ll move you right out to the balcony .   all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this ,  ellen .  &apos;
lots of shelters were in this bill . 
uh ,  mr .  president .  .  .  i don &apos;t believe that &apos;s on your agenda today . 
 .  .  .  what ? 
don &apos;t call the vice president ! 
do you know how many different kinds of laws we &apos;ve broken ? 
duane &apos;s guys ,  but he &apos;s got them under control . 
nobody &apos;s got clean kids . 
three years . 
he &apos;s not a president !  he &apos;s an ordinary person .   i can kill an ordinary person . 
are you threatening me ? 
and who &apos;s gonna find out ? 
well ,  yeah .   but you gotta start making some choices . 
yeah .   that &apos;s how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit . 
you know ,  on an empty road where you know it &apos;s safe and nobody &apos;s around .  .  . 
the teleprompter .   is it hooked up ? 
at a press conference . 
thanks ,  i wrote it . 
`dave &apos; ? 
no ,   sir .   it &apos;s more of a perceptual issue . 
well .  .  .  to shore up product identification and preserve market share . 
something like what .  .  . 
really ? 
you ever use it ? 
huh .   you know what i always wondered the way they say you guys &apos;d take a bullet for the president . 
call bob and reed .   tell them i need them immediately . 
what &apos;s that ? 
who ? 
you sure you don &apos;t want a lift back home ? 
what are you staring at ? 
look .   if there was some mistake .  .  . 
i lock at you and i see bill .  .  .   i mean ,  he &apos;s almost dead ,  but he &apos;s right here .  .  .  i mean ,  you &apos;re right here .  .  .  alive and .  .  . 
in fact ,   i &apos;m not anything like him and .  .  .  i guess i want you to know that . 
it was okay ? 
you really believe that ? 
i wish i had better news .  .  .  our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that &apos;s down eighteen on the year .   the `cares about people like me &apos; numbers are really in the toilet .   we &apos;re off twenty points from march and that was right after we raised interest rates .  .  . 
it &apos;ll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech . 
oh yeah .   did you take care of later on ? 
please .  .  . senor .  .  . destroy me .  .  . one bullet .  .  . please . 
what is it ? 
well ,  miss henried ,  what a coincidence .  you &apos;re just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you .  guess you didn &apos;t care about the other proceedin &apos;s we been dealin &apos; with here this mornin &apos; . 
now i think captain &apos;s punishment is fair ,  considerin &apos; .  in fact i think you ain &apos;t got shit ta complain about . 
they seem to be havin &apos; a good time .  some punishment . 
what is it ? 
i &apos;m gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital .  .  . 
what ? 
if you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system .  then ,  if you move fast enough ,  stay ahead of  &apos;em .  .  . without bein &apos; able to signal each other ,  they might have a hard time catchin &apos; you . 
that entrance is closest to the labs and the bee cages .

ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i don &apos;t get if i qu  -  -  it &apos;s too complicated .  i  -  -  besides .  .  . 
let &apos;s have a contest .  now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives .  but anyone can join in . 
but facts !  they have to be verified .  anything from their past ,  their present ,  business ,  personal  -  -  arrests ,  affairs  .  .  .  and whoever comes up with the sleaziest ,  most degrading material  -  -  i &apos;11 give you ten thousand dollars .  and you get to be on ed tv .   hah ? 
what do you mean all of a sudden ?  you &apos;ve been going with her six months .

are you sure all her signatures are real ?   it &apos;s not easy to get all those signatures . 
you &apos;re a very intelligent girl ,  tracy .  you have many admirable qualities .   but someday maybe you &apos;ll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead ,  and yes ,  stepping on people to get there ,  well ,  there &apos;s a lot more to life than that .   and in the end ,  you &apos;re only cheating yourself . 
so what brings you here ? 
well ,  i .  .  .  i .  .  .  that &apos;s very nice of you . 
jim ,  where the hell have you been ? 
hmm ? 
walt will be speaking with you about this ,  but i need you to find someone to take over my classes .  the lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer . 
exactly when ? 
points at the motel . 
all his life .   he &apos;s tried everything . 
paul ,  i know you &apos;ve been pretty down since your accident . 
and on halloween we could have a haunted house .   but a really good haunted house ,  not like those cheesy bad ones .   you know ,  more like the radio station ones .   this one would be really scary .   and for homecoming  -  -  well ,  you know how last year &apos;s theme was  - 
uhhh .  .  .  teeth .  teeth . 
we can &apos;t both run ,  can we ?   we &apos;re brother and sister .   can we ? 
yes ,  paul ? 
hey ,  tammy ,  guess what happened today . 
you use words like that ,  you might make me mad . 
yeah i know .   patchett &apos;s running whores and judging by his address ,  probably something bigger on the side .   he doesn &apos;t want any attention . 
did they deserve it today ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
you found patchett .   you found me .  you &apos;re smart enough .   be a detective if that &apos;s what you want . 
yeah ,  i hate them . 
what &apos;s going to happen to stensland ?   he &apos;ll give himself cirrhosis over this .   he &apos;s one< / u> year from his pension< / u> . 
you know him ? 
hey ,  partner .   grab a cup . 
tell me about the boyfriend she had .   the one you mentioned at the morgue . 
was it .  .  .  a rat ? 
one in six .   where &apos;s the girl ? 
somebody got wind of it ,  killed them all . 
pierce patchett figures in ,  too .  that &apos;s the angle jack was working .  dudley must work for patchett . 
you expecting problems ? 
you figured this was a set - up ?  and you showed up anyway ? 
i &apos;m a homicide detective .   where were you last night ? 
richard stensland . 
why were lefferts &apos; eyes black ? 
you wanna go downtown and discuss this officially ? 
if she was sitting here ,  then it &apos;s facing the wrong way .   what are these smears in the blood ? 
so on active duty ,  meeks didn &apos;t make an arrest from 1938 to  &apos;43 . 
you &apos;re twenty - two ,  aren &apos;t you ,  ray ? 
ray ,  we got the shotguns . 
you guys were arrested this morning ,  but none of you have last night &apos;s clothes .   you< / u> were seen burning them .   add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn &apos;t look good . 
this is mr .  hudgeons ,  wendell . 
it &apos;s for your own safety .   now what can you tell us about sergeant john vincennes ? 
twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with dick stensland .   they arrested a pierce patchett on an extortion scam .   guy ran hookers .  he &apos;d have them photographed with their johns ,  then double - dip for some blackmail .   charges got dropped .   insufficient evidence .  you were supervising officer on the case and i was wondering if you remember anything about it . 
have you discussed this with anyone else ,  john ? 
yesterday that might &apos;ve meant something .   pull me off .   you &apos;d be doing me a big favor . 
is there more to that ,  or do i have to guess ? 
the nite owl was solved ,  lieutenant . 
what are you going to do ? 
what &apos;s on the call sheet ? 
we got a total of forty - five spent 12 - gauge remington shotgun shells .  three men with five - shot - capacity pumps .   all of them reloading twice . 
does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier ? 
you don &apos;t like that you don &apos;t know how to play him .   he doesn &apos;t follow the same rules of politics you do .   that makes him dangerous . 
like recognizes like .   i &apos;m pretty tough ,  myself . 
a police captain .   i think he &apos;s behind all of this . 
let my susie rest in peace !

dad ! 
where &apos;ve you been ? 
they took the espresso machine .  the espresso< / i> machine ,  jerry !  which makes sense ,  you know ,  because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo . 
why don &apos;t you give  &apos;em a call . 
the nsa &apos;s doing this  &apos;cause they think i have something .  and they killed -  -

he &apos;s clever ?  he had help ?   oh . 
well .  .  . his real name &apos;s edward lyle . 
and they have the video .  that &apos;s confirmed . 
if he &apos;s with lyle it means he &apos;s got resources . 
we think it was on brill .  if it was ,  it &apos;s destroyed now . 
federal express ? 
now is that clear ? 
why did you follow me yesterday ? 
what is he saying ?   come on ,  what did he say ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
this is not very good ,  is it ? 
madox will have calculated how many miles ,  they &apos;ll soon turn around . 
when were you most happy ? 
this  -  what &apos;s it called ?   -  this place ,  i love it  -  this is mine !   i &apos;m asking the king permission to call it the almasy bosphorous . 
i just wanted you to know .  i &apos;m not missing you yet .  she nods ,  can &apos;t find this funny . 
is he next ?   do you drag him into your little room ?   where is it ?   is this it ? 
i &apos;ve watched you  -  on verandahs ,  at garden parties ,  at the races  -  how can you stand there ?   how can you ever smile ?   as if your life hadn &apos;t capsized ? 
katharine !   oh dear god ,  katharine  -  what are you doing here ? 
i think the desert is ,  it &apos;s  -  for a woman  -  it &apos;s very tough ,  i wonder if it &apos;s not too much for her . 
right .   and what &apos;s your name ,  sir ? 
what did you think you were doing in his tent ? 
i was talking about the girl . 
which we &apos;ve overflown twice . 
why do they care about our maps ? 
look ,  either shut up ,  or go home . 
we didn &apos;t care about countries .  did we ?   brits ,  arabs ,  hungarians ,  germans .   none of that mattered ,  did it ?   it was something finer than that . 
when &apos;s clifton picking you up ? 
may god make safety your companion . 
why is there so much nose ?   i can &apos;t hear myself think !   look  -  give me something .   so we can all get out of this room .   a name .   a code .   it &apos;s too hot . 
or was it toronto ? 
i &apos;d like to stay .   that &apos;s the long and short of it .   i mean ,  you know blah - blah if it &apos;s convenient ,  if there &apos;s room blah - blah - blah .   i have to do some work here  - i speak the language .  there are partisans to be  -    - we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons ,  you know  -  while we hug .   i was a thief ,  so they think i &apos;d be good at that . 
no . 
what if i told you he did this to me ? 
ask him .   ask your saint who he is .  ask him who he &apos;s killed . 
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name . 
first wedding anniversary  -  what do you call it ? 
what did you say ? 
but you were among the british ,  they were your friends  -  why betray them ? 
the team is in mourning ,  darling . 
oh . 
i do so love you .   what do you smell of ? 
of course .   well ,  we should all go out onto the terrace . 
there was a prince ,  who was dying ,  and he was carried up the tower at pisa so he could die with a view of the tuscan hills .  am i that prince ?  hana laughs . 
there &apos;s a man downstairs .   he brought us eggs .   he might stay . 
could i ask you to move ?   i &apos;m sorry  -  but when you turn ,  the sheets ,  i can &apos;t really bear the sheets moving over me .  sorry . 
you like him ,  don &apos;t you ?   your voice changes . 
i &apos;m still here . 
why don &apos;t you go ?   you should sleep . 
who knows the bosphorus hug ? 
where &apos;s your stuart from ?  somewhere near there ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
kip  -  come and dance with me
the war &apos;s over  -  you told me yourself .  how can it be desertion ? 
it &apos;s not safe here .   the whole country &apos;s crawling with bandits and germans and god knows what .   it &apos;s madness .   i can &apos;t allow it .  you &apos;re not ,  this is natural  -  it &apos;s shock .  for all of us .   hana  - 
hello . 
i was looking for the lieutenant singh . 
whoa  -  give me a chance ! 
i &apos;ve got a surprise .   a boat !   we can go to capri .   it &apos;s got a cabin ,  it &apos;s private . 
you &apos;ve got to cut ,  sir ,  that frost won &apos;t last . 
katharine ! 
you should sit down ,  darling .   she &apos;s quite all right .   are you pregnant ? 
brick platform opposite the old ajaib - gher  - 
this is wonderful ! 
kip ? 
they &apos;re excited !   they &apos;re happy about destroying a whole city .  would they do that to a white man &apos;s city ?   never ! 
no . 
or my wife &apos;s . 
you didn &apos;t answer the beeper either . 
so he popped the pane ?

for god &apos;s sake . 
i &apos;m not here to run errands .  i &apos;m here for the mask . 
he says they turned the card down . 
that &apos;s entrapment . 
what &apos;s my problem ?  you want a list ? 
and -  - 
someone was expecting that . 
so the mask is part of the down payment too .  must be a really big job . 
so you &apos;re testing me< / u> now ? 
let &apos;s do it again . 
did i hear a car ? 
thank you . 
to us .  to the mask . 
aren &apos;t we all . 
they moved it . 
careful .  .  . careful . 
the big job .

you have the right to remain silent .  but anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you -  - 
the porta power .  .  . comm kits .  .  . got the ir / thermo camera ? 
you look like george washington .

you &apos;ll just have to have faith . 
my friend ,  you always surprise me . 
250 , 000 ?

whoa .   remind me . 
how does someone get meningitis ? 
hi .   donna irving ? 
this is a real nice place you got here .

the judge came up with a number .

well ,  that was nice of him .   isn &apos;t it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give  &apos;em the ax ? 
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s injured ,  and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward ? 
hey .   a new plaintiff called ,  wants to meet you .   i told him we &apos;d be out there thursday . 
is that what you want ? 
 .  .  .  but it won &apos;t cover annabelle daniels &apos;s medical bills . 
because that &apos;s how people treat each other< / u> ! 
okay ,  now you &apos;re making this personal ,  and it isn &apos;t  -  - 
if you &apos;re here to fire me ,  your timing &apos;s lousy . 
you know what ,  erin ?   i got nothing but time here .   why don &apos;t you let me do that for you ,  and you can get your kids some dinner .

we need to talk . 
let &apos;s pretend .   you &apos;re the department of transportation ,  and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects ?   brake linings that fail after a thousand miles .   fuel injectors that burn people alive . 
whoever set this homemade dynamite could &apos;ve blown out the pilot light days before the explosion .   the gas ,  it seems ,  was just a detonator . 
no .   no ,  sir .   i loved that condo .  i loved every stick of furniture .  the lamps ,  the chairs ,  the rugs ,  were me .   the dishes were me .   the plants were .  .  . 
and i saw you practicing this .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .   i guess .  .  .  when people think you &apos;re dying ,  they really listen ,  instead .  .  . 
we &apos;ll split up the week .   you can have lymphoma ,  tuberculosis and  -  - 
that &apos;s the idea  -  -  we split them . 
this could go on for hours .

i don &apos;t want to hear anything you &apos;ve got to say .

 .  .  .  oh ,  yeah .   oh ,  yeah . 
no .   that &apos;s a good thing ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
but a good strange . 
the fight . 
if you could fight anyone .  .  .  one on one ,  whoever you wanted ,  who would you fight ? 
the previous occupant had been a bit of a shut - in . 
fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails . 
you ? 
i mean ,  this girl .  .  .  uh ,  you &apos;re not into her or anything .  .  .   ? 
promise you won &apos;t .

hey . 
why wasn &apos;t i involved from the beginning ?   you and i started fight club together . 
what do you want ?   a statement of purpose .  .  .   ? 
should i e - mail you ?   should i put this on your  &quot; action item list ?  &quot; 
why do you think i blew up your condo ? 
people think that you &apos;re me ,  because you and i happen to share the same body . 
we &apos;re going to have to do something about marla .  .  . 
i &apos;m pulling the green wire . 
yes .  .  . 
bob was a grown man .   in any great struggle ,  there will be casualties .  wouldn &apos;t that be implicit in the name ?   project  &quot; mayhem .  &quot;

alright ,  christ !   fucking let me go ! 
is this a picture of mom and dad ? 
are you crazy ?   what makes you think you &apos;d survive ? 
what do you want me to do ? 
a mortician .   he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us . 
then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect eugene and isabella for as long as we can . 
um ,  clear ?   i &apos;m sorry .  .  . about before .  i .  .  . 
the only reason he was on route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings .

last july i dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident .  they asked me what number means  &quot; good luck &quot;  in jewish . 
what &apos;s going on here ? 
that &apos;s the truck that &apos;s going to kill everyone ! 
i tried calling last night but your father  -  -

i believe that .  .  .  ms .  lewton &apos;s next . 
i &apos;m .  .  .  a friend of his .  his best friend .  see ,  his father .  .  .

it &apos;s not necessary . 
i know .  .  . 
take your time . 
look ,  it was a screw - up ,  alright ?  they weren &apos;t supposed to find anything .   we thought that camp was empty . 
that depends on you .   christ ,  look at you .   i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment .  .  .  all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas .  .  .  and you have to make it rambo &apos;s last stand .

i don &apos;t think i &apos;d notice .  i &apos;m so used to carl . 
i love to swim ,  and i don &apos;t mind the cold at all .  it &apos;s invigorating . 
nothing . 
if you &apos;re free . 
you had no inner feeling ? 
you think i &apos;m a fake . 
up to now ,  what i &apos;ve been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow .  .  . 
i married him when i was 17 .  he was a cellist ,  and i thought he was the most brilliant man i &apos;d ever met .  .  .  and i &apos;m sure he was ,  because at that age ,  i hadn &apos;t met that many .  .  .  but he was insidious ,  you know .  he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity ,  musically ,  as a woman ,  as an intellect .  but in this completely imperceptible ,  pleasant way ,  so that you weren &apos;t even sure he was doing it .  anyway ,  i just woke up one morning and i said ,  you know something joseph ,  you &apos;re full of beans ,  and i left him .  .  . 
robert ? 
i have to talk to you . 
did you hear about my misfortune ,  robert ? 
she &apos;s tremendously gifted ,  this girl . 
come on ,  get moving ,  dammit !  ! 
and what about love ? 
salesmen and cops are the ones .  if you &apos;d ever waitressed ,  honey ,  you &apos;d know . 
and you know ,  i read where they invented this car that runs on .  .  .  that runs on .  .  .  when you boil water .  .  . 
pardon me ? 
miss dupea . 
i &apos;d like to remind you again ,  this isn &apos;t an opera or a musical comedy .

wha &apos; ? 
oh man ,  what we gotta leave ar &apos; own neighborhood for ? 
a bad attitude . 
i think he &apos;s 18 or 17 . 
where you know amanda from ? 
god i admire you . 
creasy ,  how old are you ? 
why are you doing this mr .  fletch ? 
your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you &apos;re about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing .  fletch starts to get up ,  but cummings plants his foot on fletch &apos;s chest ,  forces him back down . 
 &apos;your men &apos; might just be involved in all this . 
speaking of which ,  you &apos;re not going to print anything before my investigation is through ,  are you ? 
that &apos;s two . 
no children ? 
it was .  really a shame .  to go so suddenly . 
yes ,  but the very end ,  when he actually died ,  that was extremely sudden .   you know ,  alan and i were recently speaking of dying .  told me boyd aviation took out a lot of insurance on him .  you must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy . 
did i say  &apos;kidneys &apos; ?  i meant my ear .  maybe i should see an ear dahhh  -  -   ever serve time ? 
my pleasure . 
you find the source ? 
until she remarries ,  fletch . 
why don &apos;t you check it out for yourself ,  mr .  nugent ? 
i don &apos;t doubt it ,  mr .  stanwyk .  actually ,  my company is the sub -  insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by alan stanwyk ,  who i believe is your son . 
okay .   now ,  the last time you saw your son was when ? 
forgive me now for seeming personal ,  but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in provo . 
i couldn &apos;t sit home and play the mournful widow anymore ,  and the police didn &apos;t need me ,  so i tried watching a lakers game on tv ,  but the announcer talked to fast and i couldn &apos;t understand a lot of what was happening ,  so i figured if i came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me ,  and besides ,  i missed you . 
i &apos;m the sufi . 
don &apos;t call me fletch .  don &apos;t look at me .  lie back down .  we &apos;ll talk . 
why are they after you ? 
fat sam is turning state &apos;s evidence . 
i &apos;ll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition .  if you reject the proposition ,  you keep the thousand ,  and your mouth shut . 
you don &apos;t look sick ,  mr .  stanwyk . 
wouldn &apos;t they normally be locked ? 
yo ! 
only if you promise not to return me . 
w - y - k no  &apos;c .  &apos; i &apos;ll be down in a minute . 
 &apos;stanwyk &apos;s parents ,  marvin and velma stanwyk ,  also of provo ,  were unable to attend the wedding .  &apos;

oh ,  that &apos;s all right ,  i &apos;ve got lots more .  want to see the reception ?

thanks ,  i feel much better .  listen ,  if you &apos;re so bored ,  why didn &apos;t you go to utah with alan ? 
gail .  i hope this won &apos;t embarrass you in any way .  i think underhill &apos;s a yutz ,  you won &apos;t have any trouble with him . 
no . 
i don &apos;t have all the pieces yet ,  but i &apos;m close .  i &apos;ll know tomorrow .

what are you running from ? 
feel my thumb ?   i keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain .   i leave .   twenty -  one minutes later ,  you &apos;re dead .  the slowest ,  most painful minutes a person can experience . 
i want you to say that you &apos;re the biggest sissy in the whole wide world . 
how could grendel records sign such a wick - prick ?   i guess julian grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob .   i hear ray charles is going to head up the video division . 
what about don ? 
when i say  &apos;no ,  &apos; run for the door . 
you &apos;d said something about proof .  .  . 
and may i suggest for dessert ,  the five copies i made .  .  . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music .   those ingrates really take a bite .   but seriously ,  when pops died ,  you got vomit ,  crunch ,  and sutton to help finance a c . d .  cleans operation .  you got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you ,  but .  .  . 
i &apos;m still the king ! 
that &apos;s cute .   you &apos;re funny . 
nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big ,  you redhook bastard . 
how nice . 
what about you ?   can you stand a toss ?

tu sais j &apos;ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage .   je l &apos;ai choisi moi - mme .   tiens . 
le sommes nous ? 
where &apos;s he from ? 
yeah .   in the late innings .   ya look like a night &apos;s sleep wouldn &apos;t kill ya . 
who stuck up the laundromat ? 
i think we oughta burn him on suspicion . 
what the hell am i drivin &apos; for ?  i &apos;m a first grade detective .  you &apos;re a second grade guinea . 
throw  &apos;em in the bathroom ,  will you ?  how good are the warrants ? 
the guy &apos;s a frog  -  -  i &apos;m pretty sure .  also he made me .   stayin &apos; on four but went up to six  -  -  cute . 
pass . 
there are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs ,  handling about a thousand vehicles a month .   those that aren &apos;t claimed are auctioned here once a month . 
i &apos;m afraid the rest of ward &apos;s island isn &apos;t nearly as romantic  -  a pollution plant ,  a hospital ,  a training school for garbage men and that area over there ,  where the old cars are kept ,  prior to being processed for shipment to ,  among other places ,  the charnier shipping company ,  of marseilles ,  france . 
they around ? 
frankie ,  johnny wants to say goodnight . 
you give him his drops ? 
i &apos;ll be upstairs .  .  . if you want to play . 
then you gotta hide it somewhere .  somewhere where nobody &apos;s gonna find it .  .  . for 29 years !   put it under the loose floorboard by the window ! 
hey ,  bud . 
satch ,  you gotta just give me .  .  . satch is here john .   you hear me ?   satch is here .

you sound .  .  . ground up .  .  .  ? 
it &apos;s really you ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
no wait ,  don &apos;t go ! 
why ? 
it &apos;s hard to explain .   something happened today .   it was like a dream .   and when i woke up i had all these new memories .  good times .   times we never had before . 
what can we do ?   you don &apos;t even know who this guy is . 
you ever talk to a victim &apos;s family ?   the one &apos;s left behind ?   they don &apos;t act like what you &apos;d think .   there &apos;s panic and fear .   but mostly ,  it &apos;s like there &apos;s this logic problem .   and if they could only solve it ,  everything would be okay .   but if you look real close  -  look at their eyes  -  you can see it .   just a glimmer .   but somewhere they know .   they know their world is never gonna be the same . 
no .   i just kept talking to her .   there was a lot of guys in that bar  -  could &apos;a been any of  &apos;em . 
he killed her john .   he killed her and i didn &apos;t do a thing to stop it . 
i don &apos;t think i can .   i &apos;m not a cop .   i can &apos;t .    i can &apos;t stop this guy . 
i need you to believe in me .   to believe that we can do this . 
what ? 
he took your wallet ? 
john ,  you there ? 
i &apos;m not your uncle ,  kid .   gordo ,  what are you doing here ?

c &apos;mon ,  man .   get inside .   i &apos;ll come over .  we &apos;ll play some nintendo . 
john .   john ,  you all right ? 
my father didn &apos;t die in a fire ? 
cancer .   it was the cigarettes .   right ?  the cigarettes ? 
huh ? 
i better give you my address then . 
that &apos;s what we need here ,  satch .   a lucky break . 
got a minute ? 
hi ,  this is julia .   please leave a message after the tone . 
just came by to wrap up over there .  thought i &apos;d say  &quot; hello .  &quot; 
i look familiar ? 
dammit shelly !   why do you always have to be such an asshole ! 
no more .  .  .  i can &apos;t ! 
how do we do it ?

destroy the evidence ?   no ,  man ! 
i &apos;m gonna be sicker than all of you ,  man .   now i gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight .  .  .   i don &apos;t think i can make it ,  man ! 
you know ,  i &apos;m not sure i could live anywhere else .   the nights are always so peaceful and quiet . 
could we move a little faster ? 
this is no time to celebrate ! 
this has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country . 
vera .  .  .  you and i have had a chance to really get to know one another today .   i like you .  .  .  very much .   i was thinking that maybe . 
you &apos;ve just learned a valuable lesson .   a beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone . 
you don &apos;t  &quot; have to .  &quot; 
darren ,  we better turn around . 
better get out the hefty bags .  .  .  looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story . 
 .  .  .  . with a woman &apos;s touch . 
of course not .   if he hasn &apos;t already accidentally pelleted himself ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;s lost . 
when are you going to stop treating me like one ! 
what ? 
sorry ,  megan .   not this time . 
are you sure this is gonna work ?  i mean ,  why didn &apos;t we bring that gun and just blast him away ? 
they did show up .   isn &apos;t that great ? 
so what happened ? 
which is ? 
why not ?   i used to play it alone .  i love murder games .   have you ever played the consulting detective ? 
and you &apos;ve been at some psychiatric clinic ever since ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
i gotta show you jason &apos;s grave . 
you got me where you want me .  there &apos;s no reason not .  .  . 
eight times . 
look  -  - 
legs giving you trouble ? 
listen .  .  . don &apos;t you worry about ed .  he &apos;ll come around .   he &apos;s too good a sheriff to let you give him the slip . 
careful ,  chief .   i don &apos;t think you know who i am . 
tell me . 
jessica ,  i &apos;m so sorry .   i .  .  . i wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here . 
 .  .  . and it &apos;s now ringing .  .  . ringing .  .  .  and  -  -  hello ?  anthony &apos;s pizzeria ?  yeah ,  this is officer randy parker over at the station . 
yeah ,  well somebody fucked her and if i find out it was you ,  i &apos;m gonna come over there and shoot you in the head . 
i know what it sounds like . 
you call what you did bad ?  !   you knocked her up and then left her ! 
what do you mean you &apos;ve never made a prank call ? 
that &apos;s disgusting . 
steven ! 
but she might be in trouble .  .  . 
it &apos;s not that ,  it &apos;s just that .  .  .   it i get caught ,  i &apos;ll lose my science scholarship and everything . 
right . 
and i &apos;ll never do it again .  forgive me ? 
all right .  but if it mysteriously disappears en route ,  i &apos;ll have you sent back home the minute we dock .  understood ? 
where did you get that alcohol ? 
i &apos;m her legal guardian ,  not you or anybody else ,  and i alone know what &apos;s best for her .  end of discussion . 
she &apos;s fine ,  charles .  take it easy .  .  . 
you &apos;re making a big mistake ,  rennie .  it &apos;s not too late to put you back on land . 
if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of .  .  . 
you pushed me .  .  . 
so ,  are you having fun yet ? 
the captain and chief engineer .  .  .  they &apos;ve been .  .  . they &apos;re dead . 
yes .  .  . 
can he really take us home ? 
i used to drive a taxi . 
nicky .  i was thinking about you .  i went to the preview last night . 
i &apos;m trying to think .  when did you start looking so terrible ?  you look awful . 
suffering .  you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread . 
tonight .  what &apos;s tonight ? 
do you want me to tell you what it was like ,  reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing mecca ? 
shoot him ,  nicky .  not that we really mean it .  but where does he live ? 
this could be it . 
does it feel comfortable ? 
peter redmond .  they found out why he can &apos;t remember his lines .  there &apos;s something living in his brain .  a parasite he picked up in borneo ,  doing the movie . 
that &apos;s not all ,  nicky .  i &apos;ve been backing your plays for fifteen years .  and i &apos;ve never been more depressed . 
i &apos;m seeing your play tonight ,  remember ? 
i didn &apos;t turn her into mother .  you did . 
opening night ? 
i &apos;m willing to tell you my name . 
see ,  daddy . 
i had an affair  -  -  are you sure you want to hear this ? 
we did it in the office .  she thought her apartment was too impersonal . 
where the hell are you ? 
lillian says it once a week .  `why doesn &apos;t he come live with us ?  &apos;
where &apos;s your elastic brace ? 
i &apos;m lucky they don &apos;t knock down the building .  it could happen anytime .  and everything worth remembering is right here . 
a grandmother .  god bless you . 
you &apos;re a family man ,  frankie ? 
your problem is you take the easy way out .  losing is easy . 
this is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years .  very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see ,  matthew .  the red sox win a world series .  this is deeply ,  intensely personal .  all the mistakes i &apos;ve made ,  all the envy ,  fear and violence that &apos;s encased in this little envelope we call a person  -  -  all washed away in the next few minutes .  and your grandmother knows why . 
and you &apos;re not saying that because of the gun in my hand ? 
postpone .  we have every right . 
i &apos;ve had three straight washouts ,  sidney . 
finally ,  i get a waiter who doesn &apos;t know  &quot; macbeth &quot;  . 
what was your favorite color crayon ,  growing up ? 
but you &apos;re his friend . 
no one &apos;s waiting . 
stay .  teach me to be compassionate . 
that &apos;s the sort of thing you &apos;ll be seeking on this  &quot; farm &quot;  .  .  . 
maybe i &apos;m wrong .  .  .  maybe we &apos;re not ready yet .  in south africa the numbers were small .  .  . 
they are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way .  but the will has gone  -  -  independence will drop like a ripe apple .  the only question is when  and how . 
without a paper  -  -  a journal of some kind  -  -  you cannot unite a community .   you belong to a very important profession . 
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i &apos;m still searching for a  &quot; response .  &quot; 
and you &apos;ve come all this way because you think something is going to happen ? 
is it over if they arrest you now ? 
it has .  but you &apos;d be surprised .  they understand  -  -  they really do .  it &apos;s not the workers you have to worry about . 
well ,  then ,  it must be fought .  we are children of god like everyone else . 
they &apos;re sparing no one ,  i see . 
the fools !   sorry .  .  . 
if we hold firm ,  it won &apos;t be the last . 
perhaps some tea ? 
mr .  gandhi ,  i &apos;ve more or less decided to ask the house to repeal the act that you have taken such  &quot; exception &quot;  to . 
hm .  of course it is not quite that simple . 
i &apos;m glad to hear you say that .  .  .  very glad .  you see if we repeal the act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment .  can you understand that ? 
according to this ,  he &apos;s a sick man .   congenital heart condition .   who knows how long the specimen has been here but there &apos;s an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes . 
even if this vincent luca is< / i> alive ,  is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death ? 
 -  - there &apos;s that word again .   i have a feeling this man doesn &apos;t play the odds ,  detective .   not exactly a slave to probability .   is it  &quot; likely &quot;  that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years -  - a brutal killer -  - is going to come to us now like a lamb ? 
he was afraid of being exposed .   that &apos;s why he did it . 
okay ,  how tall did you used< / i> to be ? 
it &apos;s not too late to back out . 
that &apos;s not the point . 
where ? 
again ? 
we &apos;ll still be able to talk when i &apos;m away .  the conversation will just keep getting longer . 
what will happen to the others ? 
he has the heart of an ox .   he could run through a goddamn wall -  - if he could still run .  actually ,  he was a big college swimming star . 
these new personality corrections i &apos;ve been reading about . 
you hypocrite .   do you think for one moment you &apos;d be doing what you &apos;re doing if it wasn &apos;t for who you are -  - what< / i> you are ?   don &apos;t you get any< / i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish ? 
if everything goes to plan ,  this could be the last time i see you for a while .   one week to go .   please tell me you &apos;re the least bit excited . 
the doctor will give you something . 
you go out much ? 
i was going to fix you breakfast . 
we are always going to be all right tomorrow .  i &apos;d like to be all right a few todays . 
i don &apos;t want to go there . 
do what i tell you ,  it &apos;s not a game . 
i always thought jails make people hard .  not you .  you &apos;re just not tough enough to forget about beynon .  i chose you ,  not him . 
no more about beynon . 
things can &apos;t get much worse can they ? 
can we make it ? 
jeep .  there &apos;s a dry river bed fifteen miles east .  he takes us to the mexican side ,  drops us off at the airfield by breakfast .  .  .  we &apos;ve got a 9 o &apos;clock flight .

that &apos;s what i want . 
you &apos;re going to have to walk back to the border . 
i don &apos;t think you have to worry much about harold .  he won &apos;t do anything . 
you can &apos;t get away from me ,  albert . 
i dunno .  he &apos;s got his ways .  he knows margaret . 
cliff brumby .  he &apos;d seen the film .  he wanted to meet doreen .

they took some of the con .  .  . 
where are you going ? 
mr .  lingk .   james lingk .   your contract went out .   nothing to .  .  .

do you think he &apos;d be satisfied with the two hundred dollars ?   i think he would . 
well ,  thank you ,  they asked for you all week . 
bought at the airport . 
it means we should all live happily for one hundred years .   the family .  if my father were alive ,  it &apos;d be true . 
connie ,  i want to be reasonable with you .   you have a house here ,  with us .   you can live here with your kids .  .  . and you won &apos;t be deprived of anything .   i don &apos;t know much about merle; i don &apos;t know what he does for a living; what he lives on .   why don &apos;t you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can &apos;t see him any more .  he &apos;ll understand .   but if you disobey me ,  and marry this pimp .  .  . it would disappoint me . 
i wanta dance .  .  . whatsa matter with that ? 
ten to one shot ,  you said .   ten to one shot in my favor ,  and i lose . 
my life won &apos;t be worth a nickel after tomorrow .

are you the son of vito corleone ? 
is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york ,  to assume and consolidate your nefarious power ? 
clemenza promised them nothing ,  he hated the sonsuvbitches . 
michael ,  you &apos;re sitting up here in the sierra mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way i run my family . 
don corleone ,  i wish you let me know you was coming .   we could have prepared something for you . 
senator geary ,  i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state .   i have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here .   the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars; why would i ever consider paying more ? 
they &apos;re still on the property .  maybe you better stay inside . 
your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your mother &apos;s still sleeping . 
on the phone ? 
forget it; i &apos;m suddenly without an appetite .   you &apos;re making big trouble ,  carmine . 
i &apos;m a little hungry ,  maybe i &apos;ll order something .   joe .   get me some bracciole or something .  and pay cash .   and in return for these concessions ,  what do you do for me ? 
what assurances do i have that there will be no more kidnapping ,  no more hits ? 
these old movies are such a hoot .  they thought they were being scary ,  but they &apos;re just funny . 
so what did you think ? 
i wasn &apos;t going to try anything . 
it &apos;s different .   he &apos;s a man .   and by the way you have no business calling him a homo . 
it still hurt .   a lot . 
i like my life .   i &apos;m a free man . 
so you don &apos;t want to fuck .   that &apos;s what you &apos;re telling me ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  you already paid me .  i &apos;m here because  -  - 
that is why he must go to hell .   i do not think it fair .   but god &apos;s law is not for us to judge . 
maybe .   but i still need to talk .  do i have time for a cup of coffee before i go ? 
what have you done with him ? 
i didn &apos;t do it .   this wasn &apos;t me . 
i was just about to ask hanna to bring down iced tea .   i &apos;d like it very much if you &apos;d join me . 
when they stay in your employ too long ,  servants begin to think they &apos;re married to you .   please ,  mr .  boone .   help yourself . 
indeed .   i &apos;d pay for the privilege of drawing your head . 
that shirt ,  mr .  boone .

you have to excuse me ,  mr .  boone .  since my stroke ,  i am often overcome with nostalgia .

what is we say phooey to the hedges ?   could you spare an hour after lunch ?   to sit for me ? 
i think we all want to feel we &apos;ve left our mark on the world .   yes .  i wish i had done more work . 
isn &apos;t it enough you told me you &apos;re a fairy ?   do you have to rub my nose in it ? 
what about your stint in korea ?  i &apos;m sure it was full of dramatic episodes . 
oh ,  there may not be atheists in the foxholes ,  but there are occasionally lovers . 
barnett .   was that his name ?  leonard barnett .   he came to the front straight from harrow .   and he looked up to me .   unlike the others ,  he didn &apos;t care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters .   how strange ,  to be admired so blindly .   i suppose he loved me .   but chastely ,  like a schoolboy . 
why do i tell you this ?   i never told david .   i never even remembered it until you got me going . 
you &apos;re very clever ,  mr .  boone .   you just sit there and let me talk .  what a sorry old man ,  you &apos;re thinking .   what a crazy old poof .   why are you here ?   what do you want from me ? 
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait .   you cannot force what will not flow .

are you enjoying yourself ? 
neither of us really belongs here . 
oh fuck .   and we left the top down .  you want to run for it ? 
you &apos;re much wider than i am .   you won &apos;t want to attempt to get into my pants .

tell me something ,  clayton .   do you believe in mercy killing ? 
 -  -  that i was a marine .   which is true .   you filled in the rest . 
them &apos;s the breaks ,  right ?   no war stories for this pup . 
so it is going to happen after all . 
no .   it won &apos;t do . 
i &apos;m not that way .   get it through your fucking head .   i don &apos;t want to mess with you . 
i liked it .   you learn stuff listening to old - timers . 
calm down ,  clay .   just calm down .  we &apos;ll watch it . 
where &apos;s betty ? 
you should have seen georgie &apos;s face when he met clayton . 
i did .   but princess margaret was a doll .   we &apos;re all equals in her eyes .   as commoners ,  i presume . 
take the luminal to sleep ,  or whenever you feel an attack coming on .

seriously ,  when i left ,  i joined the army and took the service exam .  they found my psych results fit a certain profile .  a certain  &quot; moral flexibility &quot;  would be the best way to describe it .  .  .  i was loaned out to a cia -  sponsored program .  it &apos;s called  &quot; mechanical operations .  &quot;  we sort of found each other .  .  . 
will you come with me ? 
what if i come back ?

we &apos;ve spent a lot of time discussing those years .  remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared ,  to the thought of the thing .  thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite .

well ,  let &apos;s just say that sometimes i &apos;m right .  sometimes you are . 
i am part of a network of minds ,  a group of five people who are all connected ,  over hundreds ,  even thousands of miles ,  through the mind .  we can think with each other ,  think for each other .  i can be driving somewhere ,  sleeping with a woman -  -  whatever it is -  -  and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else &apos;s mind ,  far away .  running someone else &apos;s brain .

well .  .  .  it &apos;s beautiful country ,  i &apos;ll give you that .  and i could see having some kind of vacation place .  retreat .  but i don &apos;t know how you do it full time .  don &apos;t you miss the rest of the world ?

where to ? 
where does this go ,  diane ? 
what was it like ? 
but ,  uh ,  egypt is ,  well ,  it &apos;s like nothing else .  it &apos;s like going back in time .   i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age ,  centuries ago ,  walking over that same ground ,  was wondering about or ,  if they had the same problems as me .  .  .  and i felt ,  connected to .  .  .  to time itself ,  almost .  ha ,  i never realized how hard it was to describe .

a reward for what ? 
 .  .  . you haven &apos;t found< / u> him yet . 
would you mind saying that into your bag .  .  .  ? 
i would have figured you an r . n .  by now ,  or ,  maybe med school .

lechter &apos;s not buying up his memorabilia .  he keeps it all in his  &quot; mind ,  &quot;  do you see .  .  .  ?

how you doin ? 
 .  . who would benefit from his disappearance ?   no< / u> one .   no one has but lost by it .  .  . 
first things first . 
he turned back into the room .   where have we seen it before .

he escaped .  .  . 
what do you want me to do ? 
you should get the kids a dog< / u> .  .  . 
oh ,  yes ,  what ?   you &apos;d bribe< / u> me ,  to ,  to ,  to ,   &quot; release &quot;  you .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . fraid ,  that &apos;s about it ,  doctor . 
what is that supposed to mean .  .  .  ? 
because that &apos;s understandable ,  because .  she blew the raid . 
s &apos;hotter inside than it is outside< / u> .  .  . even with the air conditioning .  
no ,  this is pleasure< / u> .  .  . 
i never met him .   i knew him only from his writings . 
it is only temporary ,  until my confirmation by .  .  . 
i &apos;m a historian .   it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious . 
dr .  fell is studying for his examination by the studiolo . 
 .  .  . they eat the dummy ,  sir ,  they eat the man< / u> .  .  .  i keep them hungry .   when .  .  .  when do we think this man arrives . 
and you let her get away . 
oh ,  is this your political position ,  you &apos;re opposed to joint .  .  . 
i realize ,  you &apos;re under a lot of .  .  .  . 
i &apos;m going to cut you loose .   with all due respect ,  doctor ,  if you fuck with me ,  i &apos;ll shoot you dead ,  do you understand .  .  .  ?   do right and you &apos;ll live through this . 
he saw the truth ,  and spoke< / u> it .  .  . 
you should get married . 
because you &apos;re going to help me plan a party . 
 .  .  . why are we here in the first< / u> place .  .  .  ? 
i am on the track of .  .  . 
the case that i am working< / u> on .  .  . 
 .  .  . and then ,  we &apos;re going to greece< / u> .  .  . 
hello .  .  .  .  ? 
i want the money . 
his feelings do him honor .   and i have come ,  simply ,  to pay my respects< / u> to the great clarice starling .  .  .  
 .  .  . a dr .  fell .   a brazilian ,  i think .  applying for fanelli &apos;s post . 
 .  .  . i feel that .  .  . 
she must be something special after dark . 
 .  .  . and to have done< / u> it ,  means ,  can mean to accept ,  not only danger< / u> ,  but betrayal< / u> .  .  .  ? 
it is you< / u> who have betrayed .  .  . 
your life has been defined by institutions .   the orphanage where you were raised ,  the fbi academy ,  the bureau .   if the institution is your life ,  accept< / u> it .   ask to be reinstated on the  &quot; drumgo &quot;  task force .   play their game . 
because ,  sir ,  you are the only one of his victims who lived .   and because you have large resources . 
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re glad i waited until the last day to have this conversation . 
now what ?  what did i do this time ? 
do you realize if the women of america would have just heard what you said .  .  .

not long .   we should arrive in the morning .   are you going to be alright ? 
yes . 
i &apos;ll go first . 
i think my sarah fancies you ,  conner . 
your words are kind and they flatter me  -  -  but i think of her as a sister .  besides ,  you hardly know me . 
aye ? 
why are you doing this ? 
electro magnetic soundings indicate we &apos;ve only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber . 
you guys are from the british museum ,  right ? 
bullet proof vests don &apos;t bleed . 
if it &apos;s good advice . 
good evening . 
you didn &apos;t answer my question . 
it came from your great ,  great ,  great grandmother ,  isabelle tourez ,  who lived in paris and died on the guillotine in 1789  -  -  alone  -  -  and unmarried .   the ring was given to her by someone who loved her  -  -  but knew that it could never be . 
they &apos;ve had a little car trouble .  i &apos;m afraid they won &apos;t be here until after dark . 
incredible .   the cloth  -  -  the buttons  -  -  it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds .   it &apos;s a remarkable duplication . 
do you ?   then why don &apos;t you go out ?  meet someone .   make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past ? 
impressive  -  -  is it not ?   the problem is i can only keep the illusion for a few minutes .   i need more power to hold the form longer .   i need the highlander .   where is he ? 
oh  -  -  i almost forgot .   your head . 
you know it &apos;s not safe here for you . 
is there anything else you need ? 
aye  -  -  i know ,  las  -  -  and i have never loved anyone more . 
do not underestimate the power of your heart .   your dreams live there . 
good afternoon ,  mr .  parker . 
the house is in flames ,  benza &apos;s accountant is with the cops ,  and they &apos;re stacking the bodies like cordwood . 
our people out there ,  they good people ?  people in the right place ? 
maybe we &apos;re getting too dramatic .   it &apos;s three kids .   they &apos;ll give up ,  the cops will arrest them ,  and that &apos;s that .   why would they search the house ? 
who sent you ? 
not if they don &apos;t catch us ,  kevin . 
i have to tell you something  -  - 
someone should stay with mr .  smith .   what if he wakes up ? 
mr .  kim didn &apos;t make it ,  dennis .   he died . 
dennis ?   i want you to release those people . 
we &apos;re not coming in there by force ,  okay ?  no one wants to hurt you .

paul ,  this scotch is exceptional . 
yes ,  general .  i am glad you came by .  i overheard something that i think you should know about . 
the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything . 
the american said intervention is too costly ,  better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command . 
he did . 
you have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty ?  did they drink my whiskey ? 
you lie . 
holy shit !  holy shit .

houston ,  i think we may have a problem .

you don &apos;t think i know ? 
we &apos;ll destroy you .  .  . destroy all of you ! 
i &apos;m not sure ,  but i can check .   did the events start before or after you discovered this ? 
 .  .  . at her request .   she was a very religious woman . 
well it &apos;s nice that you were there for her . 
now you must listen to me .  this force is like a parasite ,  or a virus .  it feeds on doubt ,  suspicion ,  discord .  .  .  you must clear your mind as we reach out for her . 
you must be the new tenants . 
my name is father seamus .   i &apos;m from holy rood church . 
do you have any other physical evidence ,  that we can look at ? 
where did you find this ? 
i see some faint lettering .   it appears to be the .  .  . runic alphabet ? 
not on station time . 
it &apos;s  .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .   first world war ,  right ? 
what will he do ?   what does he want ? 
i like you ,  joey .   you ask all the right questions .   there is something we can do but it will require great courage . 
this is his first night on earth .   he wants to close the door behind him .  like all lieutenants ,  he covets command .  there &apos;s a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back .   he has to destroy it . 
it was off the statue .   in the club . 
hold on .   hold on ,  please .   i need talk to you . 
under the underground .   can i like go now ?  ! 
yeah .   sure .   you mean  .  .  .  tonight ? 
i put some decaf on .   er  .  .  .  make yourself comfortable . 
i &apos;ll boil some water . 
wow .   lotta books .   you read all these ? 
cool .   i read a book once .   it was like all these people discovering who they used to be .   you know ,  like reincarnation ?   it was really good .   you ever read that ? 
i don &apos;t know his name  .  .  .   i saw the whole story .   a wounded bird was on his roof .   i could hear its cries from here .  he went straight to it .   i couldn &apos;t &apos;ve .  i &apos;d be frozen between pity and fear .  but he wasn &apos;t .   its pain spoke directly to him .   he picked it up .   nursed it .  fed it .   and it got better .   everyday he &apos;d watch the pigeon .   everyday the pigeon would watch him .  i saw him learn .  learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete .  and one day ,  just as afternoon became evening ,  he leaned over ,  opened the cage ,  and walked away .   didn &apos;t look back .   but he heard the sound of its wings . 
but i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . 
yeah .   i found it .   i knew held like it and i figured  .  .  . 
jesus .   are you sure this is the street ? 
it &apos;s yours .   you won it .   it &apos;s a prize . 
but you gave me a rose  .  .  . 
what  .  .  .  what  .  .  .   ? 
yes . 
you see ,  we &apos;re not so dissimilar . 
oh .   yeah .   yeah .   well  .  .  .  i &apos;m fine .  things are great here .   joey &apos;s going to get me a job at the tv station .   i &apos;m meeting lotsa new people .   it &apos;s really great .

 &quot; we all had our quarrels and parted .  .  .  &quot; 
i &apos;m a ghost .   boo .

cool ,  isn &apos;t it ?   weight ,  feel ,  mal1eability ,  they &apos;re all but identical .   on the periodic chart of elements ,  they &apos;re but one proton apart .   great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless .

oh ,  of all the foolish .  .  .  listen ,  do you take shorthand ?  are you familiar with the mimeograph machine ? 
oh ,  is that it ! 
smitty . 
 .  .  . you do ? 
 .  .  . certain people are  -  -

 .  .  . who let you in ? 
you ,  maybe you &apos;re the company &apos;s biggest moron .  we can &apos;t use morris ,  he &apos;s been with us too long ,  he &apos;s a nice guy ,  too many friends .  matter of fact ,  why don &apos;t you fire him .  no  -  -  scratch that; i &apos;ll fire him .    .  .  . make it fast ,  make it fast .

hello ,  niagara . 
miss jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast  -  -  in bed ,  with a lacy cushion to bank her head up .  if you &apos;d only seen her ,  miss connell .  she looked so pretty . 
she was very sick and then she went mindless ,  miss . 
no .   she was mindless but not like miss jessica .   but the houngan cured her . 
no ,  miss .   he &apos;s just as he was in the beginning  -  -  on the front part of an enormous boat . 
thank you ,  mrs .  rand .   i think you &apos;re every bit as nice as wes says you are . 
mrs .  rand .  .  . 
is this disease common in the tropics ? 
they didn &apos;t teach it at memorial hospital .   i had my suspicions ,  though ,  about the directress of training . 
and that  -  -   is my chair .   and this  -  -   is miss connell  -  -  who is beautiful . 
don &apos;t worry .   i wasn &apos;t missed .   the only important man here is the owner . 
have the servants made you comfortable ? 
can &apos;t i take it for you ? 
why was the maid crying ? 
i &apos;ve never given it much thought . 
i know what you went through tonight .   i kept thinking of what you said :  that all good things died here ,  violently . 
you know why .   you saw it the other night at the piano .   you turned away from me . 
i can understand that .   everyone feels that way about someone . 
and what happened then ,  mrs .  rand ? 
ah  -  -  that &apos;s where reason took hold . 
two things had happened ,  mrs .  rand .  one was that your daughter - in - law had been taken ill with a fever .  the other thing  -  -  completely disconnected  -  -  was that you had wished her ill ,  because she had hurt your sons . 
all that you say comes down to the same thing .   you are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife . 
investigation of what ? 
are you going to lie for him ,  mother ? 
that isn &apos;t true .   you never understood her . 
well ,  it &apos;s the funniest thing .  i &apos;ve been talking to some investors  -  -  a little outside venture ,  you understand ,  between you and me  -  -  about a scheme to manufacture a new styrofoam packaging .  little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping .  miraculous .  anyway ,  it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor ,  jim williams .  how about that ! 
i &apos;ve been thinking ,  ben ,  about wendy .  i was going to ask if she &apos;d come with me sometime to meet dr .  woolens . 
i did ,  but  -  -  somebody should probably see her ,  talk to her .  .  .  you think she &apos;s ok ? 
the halfords have invited us again this year . 
what do you think ? 
i .  .  .  i think i am .  .  . 
whatever that means elena  -  -  and you complain about me not communicating .  .  .  i thought it was  -  - 
you &apos;re not going to  -  - 
i &apos;ll drive you  -  - 
anyone special ?  you know .  .  . 
it &apos;s like farming .  i am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks ,  and george clair has obviously ,  in the mere two years since he joined the firm ,  he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro ,  and i assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course .  and the guy talks  -  incessantly  -  -  throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes  -  on topics that are the supposed domain of my department  -  - 
you have a point there .  that &apos;s a very good point .  we &apos;re having an affair .  right .  an explicitly sexual relationship .  your needs .  my needs .  you &apos;re absolutely right . 
what you been up to ? 
 .  .  .  while children in africa and asia are napalmed and  -  - 
what the hell are you kids doing down here ? 
i was actually trying to see about getting a little advice ,  you know  -  - 
oh .  elena wanted to know when we could expect you on thanksgiving .  it &apos;s just going to be you this year . 
and to think  -  -  they met at a key party of all things . 
hi mom . 
we &apos;re going to the halford &apos;s .  the number &apos;s on the calendar in the kitchen .  we should be home around 11 . 
i don &apos;t like coffee . 
forget what ? 
you weren &apos;t .  you actually ,  for some reason ,  you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself . 
waste not master hood  -  -  that was $20 for the bag . 
paul ,  cancel your mental appointments ,  baby .  what are you ,  like still stoned from last night ? 
flame on ,  asshole . 
huh ? 
awesome sleet and rain . 
um ,  ten - o - five .  why ?  where are you ? 
and ? 
right . 
well ,  you can .  .  . 
it feels warm . 
have you ever had a nocturnal emission ? 
who &apos;s that ? 
i could say the same thing about you . 
she your only sibling ? 
no .   but i covered it up .   i lied . 
what happened at that signing ? 
one word to i . a .  and he walks . 
no way . 
i &apos;m thinking i could get off with probation .   keep half my pension .   that &apos;s all i want . 
thought i smelled something . 
she kept saying she was gonna get out of here .   leave us all behind .   that he< / i> was going to take her ! 
my arm ! 
she used some stupid code name . 
no game . 
i &apos;m sorry ? 
no . 
expensive dresses .   a heart necklace . 
wild card . 
i understand .  i saw you in the theatre ,  your suffering ,  your sympathy for that girl .  i saw you with the boy .  you die when you kill ,  you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing .  but does that make you evil ?  or ,  since you comprehend what you call goodness ,  does it not make you good ? 
and perhaps this is the only real evil left .  .  . 
i &apos;m not innocent .  but i &apos;m afraid .  she feels she &apos;s in danger from the others . 
but why ? 
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year . 
not you my dear . 
what plans ? 
why does he call you that ? 
we &apos;re immortal .  you &apos;ve always known that . 
you .  .  .  fed on me ? 
he belongs with those reptiles ,  louis .  he deserved to die . 
hush ,  claudia ,  hush now my dear  - 
you want me to be your daughter forever ,  don &apos;t you ? 
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you . 
don &apos;t make me ,  claudia !  i cannot do it ! 
diane !  !  !  ! 
i wish i were .  but if i were ,  what would i want with you ? 
you really want to be with them ? 
dear god ,  what have i done ? 
lestat  -  finish this  - 
my god .  .  .  to think you .  .  .  are all i have to learn from .  .  . 
lestat ! 
so you want me to tell you the story of my life .  .  . 
you said the slave had a crucifix .  .  . 
did he die in the fire ? 
but you talk about passion ,  about longing ,  about things i &apos;ll never know in my life !  it &apos;s still inside you ,  in every syllable you speak !  and then you tell me it ends like that ?  just empty ? 
look at the gaslight .  don &apos;t tke your eyes off it .  you will be drained to the point of death ,  but you must stay alive .  do you hear me ? 
what can i do for you ? 
get lost ,  you scared me . 
titus ,  you &apos;re so stoned ,  you &apos;d end up in spain . 
i thought you were out of town ! 
there &apos;s nothing between will and me . 
you get any sleep at all ? 
it &apos;s okay .  .  . he doesn &apos;t believe me .  that &apos;s his right .  i &apos;m starting to think i &apos;m crazy ,  too . 
i know i don &apos;t want to stay in here . 
i &apos;m your best friend .  .  . you could have told me the truth about what happened .  i would &apos;ve understood . 
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good - friend thing first . 
and it &apos;s been blue skies all day .  it might be perfect all weekend . 
what do you mean ,  julie ? 
there was a body !  i swear it ! 
come on .  we &apos;re gonna be okay . 
why are you doing this to me ? 
i trusted you . 
worse comes to worse ,  you can stand there and watch me . 
ain &apos;t nothin &apos; free in this world .  everybody says it ,  and it &apos;s true .   i wanted you all to have a good trip . 
guess the capital of brazil  -  - 
you sure you didn &apos;t pick up my hair tie ? 
why ?  he can &apos;t help us . 
cool . 
you stumbled into my hiding place .

there &apos;s ten people on this whole island and they &apos;re all gonna end up in this jacuzzi with us . 
where is everybody ? 
take this . 
the porter .  .  . what &apos;s his name ?  old asbestos  -  - 
he is exhausted . 
i &apos;ll go up and take a look at the general  -  perhaps sit with him . 
i hope mr .  jacks gets to bed in one piece . 
tell me about them ,  thea .  they have great wings end long teeth  -  -

you told me what ? 
if it works ,  if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off ,  it &apos;ll shock the hell out of it .   we &apos;ll need a slave switch to set it off .  pull the dry cell out of the radio .

i thought we weren &apos;t suppose to yell . 
paul ! 
eric ! 
is it a rex ?

good luck with the fund raising . 
i &apos;d better get going . 
you &apos;re alan grant ,  aren &apos;t you ?   i read both of your books . 
the first one .  before you where on the island .  you liked dinosaurs back then . 
when ingen cleared out ,  they left a lot of stuff behind . 
is that all it &apos;s been ?  i thought it was longer . 
know what this is ? 
what do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs ? 
that &apos;s a very nice offer ,  mr .  kirby ,  but i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m much to busy .  if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified .  .  . 
whatever you do ,  don &apos;t call the u . s .  embassy .  they won &apos;t do a god damn thing . 
how do you mean ? 
make a blind here ?   wait for the buck to return ? 
why didn &apos;t you tell us about these guys ,  ian ?  ! 
the empty shells are crushed and trampled .   the young stay in the birth environment ,  that &apos;s conclusive ! 
and let &apos;s forget about the high hide .  we can &apos;t do this kind of work up in a tower ,  we need to be out in the field ,  as close to the animals as possible . 
very hurtful .   your mother tell you to say that ? 
are you all right ?  !   anything broken ? 
killing lessons ?   heartwarming . 
you signed a non - disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw .   you violated that agreement . 
their what ? 
then this is our chance . 
how many rounds did you find for that weapon ? 
that must be interesting .   what drew you there ? 
hey ,  i wouldn &apos;t want to spook the woolly mammoths . 
how many lines of code are there ? 
what ?   no menthol ? 
that &apos;s up to your guy on the boat .   seven o &apos;clock tomorrow night ,  at the east dock .  make sure he got it right . 
there you are .   out you come . 
but with this place ,  i  -   -  i wanted to give  them something real ,  something that wasn &apos;t an illusion ,  something they could see and  touch .   an aim devoid of  merit . 
once we have control again we  -   - 
the taphonomy sure looks that way . 
alright ,  the one on the airplane had an accident ,  but usually babies don &apos;t smell . 
ellie ,  they &apos;re absolutely  -   -  they &apos;re moving in herds .  they do move in herds ! 
oh ,  shit . 
oh ellie .   it &apos;s so beautiful .   it &apos;s the most beautiful thing i ever saw . 
 -   -  a gizzard  -   - 
are you sure ? 
they show extreme intelligence ,  even problem solving .  especially the big one .   we bred eight originally ,  but when she came in ,  she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others .   that one  -   - when she looks at you ,  you can see she &apos;s thinking  working things out .   she &apos;s the reason we have to feed  &apos;em like this .  she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . 
what about the lysine contingency ?   we could put that into effect ! 
come on ,  let &apos;s go . 
oh my god .   aw ,  god . 
no .  we can &apos;t . 
and scary . 
and his book was a lot fatter than yours . 
i threw up . 
you &apos;ll probably be safe enough  on your own  -  - 
i must &apos;ve touched something .   this happens all the time .  it must be my fault .   machines hate me . 
yeah ,  they hate me . 
their radio &apos;s out too .   gennaro said to stay put . 
i didn &apos;t say you were scared . 
that thing &apos;s got a what ,  twenty - five ,  twenty - seven foot neck ? 
it &apos;s safe ? 
all night ? 
it &apos;s am easy catch ,  you let  -   -  go  -   -  you do the counting ,  you count it ,  tim .   one ,  two ,  three  -  -  you do all the counting ,  okay ? 
don &apos;t do that ! 
alright donald ,  alright ,  but just let him talk .   i want to hear all viewpoints .   i truly do .   i truly am . 
i think perhaps i &apos;ll just sit down .   i don &apos;t suppose you think all that much of me now ,  do you ? 
that will teach you to trust grandpa . 
we miss you . 
i &apos;m sorry  -   -  i &apos;m sorry  -   - 
why are we hurrying if there &apos;s nothing wrong ? 
this is janet davenport  -  -  i &apos;m the realtor . 
i don &apos;t know .  .  . 
two . 
who ? 
a house ? 
so .  .  .  why can &apos;t jason get a fair trial ? 
what do you want  -  -  a tidy psychological profile ?  you want to hear that i was falsely accused of a crime i didn &apos;t commit .  .  .  and that &apos;s driven me to defend others ?  or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings .  .  .  talk about my childhood .  .  . 
if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder .  .  .  and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition .  .  . 
how do we prove it ? 
there &apos;s nothing to see here .  he sleeps .  .  .  we record it .  that &apos;s all that happens . 
it &apos;s as though there were two people in that room .  .  .  both of them asleep .  .  .  both of them dreaming . 
you &apos;re not going to be there ? 
krueger &apos;s in the real world .  .  .  maybe he &apos;s mortal ,  like us . 
what &apos;s that ? 
so you think it might counteract krueger &apos;s ability to make us hallucinate ? 
what happened ?  where &apos;s jason ? 
you work in the cemetery . 
 -  -  you appreciate my writing . 
when i deliver a message the very act of delivering it ,  you might say ,  gives it an official stamp ,  and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all . 
you wanted to see me ,  sir . 
the orlac< / u> claim . 
when i have no reason to doubt . 
yes  -  -  which is why  &quot; quiet ,  dependable people &quot;  have to take charge of their own lives . 
they &apos;re not obliged to tell . 
of course it could  -  -  burgel &apos;s been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember .   he< / u> could &apos;ve killed eduard . 
gabriela !   -  -  you did get away . 
this is the result of their elixir of youth .   they were to come and check on it during the night .   i contrived to miss the appointment . 
i think you &apos;ve just escaped for the moment .   just as i did .   as eduard did .   as they let us do .  but only for the moment . 
i know better than you what people will say when they have to .   when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day . 
did you go anywhere afterwards  -  -  to have a drink perhaps ? 
grown men don &apos;t normally fall into the river ,  do they ? 
he might have had a drink or two ,  despite what you think . 
but that &apos;s just my point  -  -  she was more than upset ,  she was livid .  she slammed every door on her way downstairs  -  -  except that one .   i was just behind her and i didn &apos;t even hear that one shut< / u>  -  -  not at all . 
 -  -  i was just trying to finish some work ! 
 -  -  if an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident  -  -  and should he tragically die in spite of the district medical officer &apos;s strenuous efforts to save him  -  -  the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible  .  .  .  efficiency . 
and i suppose dr .  murnau didn &apos;t die in a cave - in .   you killed him to free the position of orlac medical officer for your own ends . 
they keep switching us from department to department .   he doesn &apos;t mind because he can &apos;t sit still . 
father it &apos;s somewhere south - west of here  -  we need to inform the museum  .  .  .   organize an expedition  - 
ann  .  .  .  ann ! 
they &apos;re stoking the boilers .  as soon as we &apos;ve got some steam ,  we &apos;re outta here . 
tell me mr ginting  -  are there any parts of your country where people still wear  .  .  .  native costume ? 
haven &apos;t seen her  -  not since we got back . 
are you nervous jack ? 
mm . 
 -  -  may i ?  it &apos;s so  -  - 
the truth is i hate them :  they must hate me .  all right ,  the money .   all right ,  not the money .  a kind of put - on .  it gets things back together .   well let &apos;s say i &apos;d go to one of these cattle - calls ,  a tryout .  i mean before  -  -  before i got this job  -  -  and they &apos;d always say thank you very much and i &apos;d feel ,  you know ,  brought down .  they didn &apos;t want me . 
a few more days .  we know who did this . 
is that what he set me up for ?  everything he &apos;s told me from the beginning ?   -  -  don &apos;t worry ,  don &apos;t  -  - 
 -  -  we can talk  -  - 
no ,  you &apos;re frightened ,  you &apos;re pretending .  well  -  -  klute knows about me then .  does everybody know ,  can you tell me ? 
you said that . 
who ? 
gee . 
why ? 
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper  -  -  frank sent me on it . 
oh golly ,  oh just what i &apos;ve always dreamed of ,  dirty phone calls .   how come ? 
is there anything more i could  -  - 
oh  -  -  wait  -  -  oh i get it .  you said that just to keep me scared .  so i &apos;d tell you everything i  -  -  oh clever; oh you smart ,  tricky hick . 
i am scared .  the things i do .  the things i could do to you . 
well suppose i hadn &apos;t come downstairs .  would you just have folded up and sneaked away ? 
all right ,  suppose it wasn &apos;t tom grunemann; where does that get you ? 
i &apos;ve been up country ,  you know my summer place ,  my camp .  i don &apos;t even have a telephone there .  this morning they sent a messenger out ,  that you &apos;d been trying to call me . 
you said trask was arranging laboratory work .  police laboratory .  anything from that ? 
you must be discouraged . 
i can &apos;t follow you . 
well  -  - 
it &apos;s a beautiful day in tuscarora  -  i don &apos;t envy you that humidity in the city . 
all right .  all right  -  -   john ,  just sit tight will you ?  i &apos;ll read your report ,  i &apos;ll discuss it with the others .  i &apos;ll be back next thursday ,  we &apos;ll talk the whole thing over then .  nothing til thursday ,  all right ? 
ok ,  a family matter .  between the girls .  i had two other cows  -  -    -  -  two other girls besides bree . 
klute knew tom .  he has a great many ideas about the case  -  - 
he hits me on the planet kriptarium ,  when i steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory . 
sure .   too much birthday cake ,  right ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
all it is is onions and gravy . 
i &apos;m sorry .  .  . 
daddy ? 
now go to sleep .   it &apos;s very late . 
ohhh .  .  . ohhhh .  .  . ohhhhh .  .  . 
wow ! 
billy ,  sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced ,  there &apos;s a discussion about who the child should live with ,  the mother or the father .   now there is a man who is very wise .   he &apos;s called a judge .   and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with . 
bigger than a principal .   the judge sits in robes in a big chair .  .  the judge has thought a lot about us ,  about you and me and your mom ,  and he has decided .  .  .    .  .  . he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom joanna in her apartment .   and i &apos;m very lucky .   because even though you &apos;ll live with your mom joanna i &apos;ll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month . 
i &apos;ll send your toys there and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll get some new ones . 
now then ,  mr .  o &apos;connor ,  how long did ted kramer work for you ? 
and did you have a close personal relationship ? 
and how did you find his work ? 
now then ,  mrs .  kramer ,  you said you were married seven years .  is that correct ? 
did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way ? 
is that .  .  . permanent ? 
were you ? 
here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning .   they &apos;ll be ready on saturday . 
how &apos;s the new job ? 
look at us ,  joanna .   just like any old married couple having dinner .   who would believe it . 
please ,  ted .   i never would have brought it up if i thought -  - 
ted ,  will you take it easy ?  revlon &apos;s not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this ,  without making us sweat .   now just relax ,  okay ?  everything &apos;s gonna be fine . 
so ,  naturally ,  you assume that since joanna left ,  that would be a compelling point against her ,  right ? 
now in haskins vs .  haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother ,  thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby . 
and ? 
what ? 
oh ,  no .  . 
ted ?   they &apos;ve set the court date .  i just heard today .  .  . it &apos;s .  .  .   january sixth . 
what ?  !   she wants what ?  ! 
your boy is very lucky ,  mr .  kramer .   one inch over and it would have caught the eye . 
now ,  i &apos;d advise you to wait outside .   it &apos;ll be eas -  - 
yeah ,  she said it wasn &apos;t any use talking anymore . 
look ,  this is nothing personal ,  but i don &apos;t think you can do it . 
wait a minute !   wait a minute ! 
how many onions does it say to use ? 
california ? 
where will you keep them ? 
i will buy them for you . 
why is it necessary for the chinese to keep so many soldiers in lhasa ? 
then ,  we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland . 
do you have plans to return soon ,  dalai lama ? 
did you receive the letter ? 
so ,  we must face china and all her might alone . 
your prime ministers ,  support the proposal that you return to lhasa .  on the opposite hand ,  some officials urge you not to return .  they believe you should leave now ,  for india . 
may i listen to the news with you ,  holiness ? 
will we be in this war ? 
in the pacific ocean . 
tell me . 
india is a newly independent nation .  they are struggling .  india is in no position to help us . 
what is the size of our army ,  now ? 
has anyone died ? 
the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war . 
did you ever doubt it ? 
the pursuit of non - violence .  very difficult . 
i have news .  the regent has resigned his post . 
it is a story ,  you decide . 
this is tibet .  and this is china . 
the people want you made dalai lama . 
don &apos;t eat all those sweets .  you &apos;ll get sick . 
this is not a fight to put bread just in one &apos;s own mouth .  this is a fight for tibet . 
taktra rinpoche ,  i understand there was an attempt on your life . 
hmm . 
around here .   yeah . 
we are here on official business . 
what are you< / u> doing ?  ! 
again ,  i don &apos;t mean to be annoying with my questions .   but if it is< / u> a crocodile which i don &apos;t think it is .   and if they do< / u> charge these baby hatchling sounds .  .  .   why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time ?   with you it makes sense . 
is this a trick ? 
just spit him back out .   some shall live ,  some shall die ,  arbitrarily ,  sound like any higher power we know ? 
you probably do< / u> want to be killed by it ,  that was you trying to meet your maker . 
forget< / u> it< / u> . 
you take care . 
if he &apos;s here ,  i &apos;ll find him .   did she tell you we had sex together ? 
you should< / u> take a flax pole . 
two years married ,  divorced ,  used to be a lawyer ,  quit ,  i &apos;m still waiting on his sperm count . 
i &apos;m an empty man ,  kelly ,  wealth has robbed me of the dream in life ,  i sit here broken ,  a hollow sack -  - 
how big do the bears get ? 
if this is who i think< / u> it is .   it is< / u> . 
no .   u . s .  wildlife is on their way . 
when you get scared ,  the brain releases a chemical ,  same chemical it releases when somebody &apos;s .  .  .   in high school ,  the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie . 
i &apos;m saying between the moonlight ,  a beautiful lake and< / u> a monster that bites heads off .  .  .  you look good . 
sorry . 
who taught you be be a nurse ? 
i &apos;m not mushing it . 
it can &apos;t work . 
he &apos;s through fighting .   look at him . 
that was .  .  .  y &apos;know if the guy asks me can she kiss ,  now i &apos;ll be able to tell him if you can . 
what &apos;s that ? 
have you ever seen a dead body before ,  ms .  scott ? 
this is a little different . 
not yet . 
what< / u> is< / u> that< / u> ? 
what is with this lake ?   it looks black and .  .  .  there are no waves or anything . 
i told you .   two days ,  we &apos;d have to camp . 
what ? 
they &apos;re coming right in . 
hi .   listen .   could i steal you a second ? 
yeah ,  that part .   there &apos;s .  .  .  somebody who &apos;s um .  .  . 
are you on drugs ? 
you< / u> ? 
i &apos;m not upset ,  myra ,  okay .   i just never thought of you as a y &apos;know .  .  . 
what &apos;d i do ? 
phone call ,  clarice .  it &apos;s god . 
no .  he won &apos;t come after me . 
clarice  -  you did the best anybody could have for catherine martin .  you stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried .  it &apos;s not your fault it ended this way . 
some fishermen in west virginia found an unidentified girl &apos;s body .  it &apos;s a buffalo bill - type situation .  been in the water about a week ,  and jack needs somebody that can print a floater .  think you can handle it ? 
fbi ,  catherine ,  you &apos;re safe . 
i &apos;ll get you out !  just be quiet so i can hear .  shut that dog up .   is there a ladder ?  is there a rope ? 
dr .  chilton  -  if lecter feels you &apos;re his enemy  -  as you &apos;ve said  -  then maybe i &apos;ll have more luck by myself .  what do you think ? 
you &apos;re playing a piano ,  miss starling ? 
you see ,  the one we want most refuses to cooperate .  i want you to go after him again today ,  in the asylum . 
miggs has been murdered . 
the orderly heard lecter whispering to him ,  all afternoon ,  and miggs crying .  they found him at bed check .  he &apos;d swallowed his own tongue .  .  .  chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit ,  and he &apos;s trying to blame it on you .  i told the little prick your conduct was flawless .   starling .  .  .  ? 
talk about him ,  starling .  tell me what you see . 
are you finished ? 
when we get back ,  i want you to run that bug by the smithsonian ,  see if they can identify it .  maybe it &apos;s got some limited range ,  or it only breeds at certain times of year .  .  .  you found it ,  starling ,  you deserve the credit . 
but for catherine martin ,  it all comes down to you and lecter .  you &apos;re the one he talks to . 
what would it take ? 
are you in trouble over this ,  mr .  crawford ?  can senator martin do something to you ? 
lecter is still the key ,  i know he is .  whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before . 
this gumb &apos;s a real beauty .  slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve ,  and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric .  where ,  starling ,  he took vocational rehab ,  and learned a useful trade .  .  . 
oh sure ,  me &apos;n pam malavesi used to help her do alterations for old mrs .  lippman .  lots of people worked for her ,  she had the business from all these retail stores ?  but she was like ,  totally old ,  it was more &apos;n she could handle . 
you get to travel around and stuff ?  i mean ,  better places then this ? 
now then .  what did miggs say to you ?    &quot; multiple miggs ,  &quot;  in the next cell .  he hissed at you .  what did he say ? 
oh ,  officer starling .  .  .  do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool ? 
reasonably so .  yes . 
his real name is benjamin raspail .  a former patient of mine ,  whose romantic attachments ran to ,  shall we say ,  the exotic .  .  .  ?  i didn &apos;t kill him ,  merely tucked him away .  very much as i found him ,  in that ridiculous car ,  in his own garage ,  after he &apos;s missed three appointments .  you &apos;d have him under  &quot; missing person &quot;   -  which ,  in poor raspail &apos;s case ,  could hardly be more true . 
who can say .  .  .  ?  best thing for him ,  really .  his therapy was going nowhere . 
and have them clomping about in my life ?  oh dear ,  no .  .  .  at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own .   how did you feel when you saw him ,  clarice ?  may i call you clarice ? 
do you have something you use ,  when you need to get up your courage ?  memories ,  tableaux .  .  .  scenes from your early life ? 
jack crawford is helping your career ,  isn &apos;t he ?  apparently he likes you .  and you like him ,  too . 
 &quot; plum island animal disease research center .  &quot;  sounds charming . 
no .  .  .  !  quid pro quo ,  doctor . 
on what basis would they reject him ? 
then tell me how . 
no .  precisely .  we begin by coveting what we see every day .  don &apos;t you feel eyes moving over your body ,  clarice ?  i hardly see how you couldn &apos;t .  and don &apos;t your eyes move over the things you want ? 
not  &quot; just ,  &quot;  clarice .  what set you off ?  you started what time ? 
i didn &apos;t get more than a few miles before the sheriff &apos;s car found me .  the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman .  i never saw the ranch again .  .  . 
starling . 
senator martin .  .  .  !  you can &apos;t trust jack crawford or clarice starling .  it &apos;s such a game with these people .  they &apos;re determined to get the arrest for themselves .  the  &quot; collar ,  &quot;  i think they say . 
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake ,  build fires and provide every comfort you desire ,  alice .  .  . 
the ottawa are gone . 
i do not remember them .  i was one or two . 
what are you looking at ,  mr .  poe ? 
they &apos;re going to hang you .   why didn &apos;t you leave when you had the chance ? 
are we safe ? 
and my compliments to you .  .  . 
where will we go ? 
the man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room ,  in my presence .  he is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal ,  regardless of what he did for my children . 
you still have an aversion to the water ? 
dear duncan ,  my affection is as towards a closest friend .  alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely .  .  .  i wish they did ,  but my feelings don &apos;t go beyond that .  do you see ? 
beyond the periphery of men ,  staring at him . 
miss cora munro .  he never set eyes on her before today . 
fort edward ,  then ? 
help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores . 
many men here ,  their homes are in the path . 
that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms & families .  .  .  major heyward was at john cameron &apos;s .  he saw what it was .

i can &apos;t tell you much about it ,  except that none of you show any symptoms .

personal effects .  .  . 
what happened ? 
no way ,  mister beck !   no< / u> fucking way< / u> !   we just did a full shift ,  you can &apos;t call shack duty on top of a full shift .   it &apos;s a contract violation ! 
i say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here ! 
bad as he is there &apos;s no way we can make our quota with -  out his sad self out there .  you just can &apos;t do it . 
it &apos;s sixpack ! 
bigger than dejesus ?   how ? 
what is it ? 
no .  .  . he &apos;s really sick .   i heard him last night .   the company will take that into consideration .  .  . 
what is it ? 
soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour .  he is proud of his job ,  and even more proud that it &apos;s legal . 
let me tell you about hatchet harry .  once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry .  it was rumoured that he was on the take .  harry invited smithy round for an explanation .  smithy didn &apos;t do a very good job .  within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand ,  which happened to be a fifteen - inch black rubber cock .  he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go  .   .   .  hence ,  hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe .

between your book sales and this tv thing ,  there &apos;s going to be no living with you .   and let me guess ,  you boiled god down to a conceit . 
no matter ,  my son ,  he believes in you . 
you lied to me my whole life .  everything you said ,  everything you did . 
you raised me ,  like a son . 
so ,  if christ won ,  that means ,  what does that mean ,  father ?   that satan .  .  . 
may i help you ? 
a narcissist doesn &apos;t admit it .   it &apos;s the extreme of self - denial . 
well ,  by saying that ,  you &apos;re acknowledging the existence of a higher power .   which ,  to a narcissist ,  is impossible . 
trick him . 
you should think about getting professional help . 
peter ,  your blood - type is ab negative .  there &apos;s no way your birth father can be o positive .   you father is not who you think he is . 
when townsend tried to kill me ,  he said something strange like .  .  .    &quot; the time of transformation is near .  .  .  &quot; 
hang on ,  get it up ,  go on ,  higher . 
there &apos;s nothing else here .

after five years . 
and now i &apos;m paying for it ,  right ?   that what this is about ?    &quot; i told you so ?  &quot; 
yeah . 
don ,  you got hit by lightning that time in tahoe ,  you went on vacation ,  i don &apos;t think braces is a good idea  -  - 
you ok ? 
hi ,  hello ,  great .   this is seduce and destroy ? 
well i don &apos;t want to order anything ,  you see .  i have a situation ,  a situation just come up that &apos;s really pretty serious and i &apos;m not sure who i should talk to or what i should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if i explain myself ? 
well ,  ok .   lemme see how i explain this without it seeming kinda crazy ,  but here go :   i &apos;m ,  my name is phil parma and i work for a man named earl partridge  -  -  mr .  earl partidge .  i &apos;m his nurse .   he &apos;s a very sick man .  he &apos;s a dying man and he &apos;s sick and he &apos;s asked me to help him ,  to help him find his son  -  -  hello ?   are you there ,  hello ? 
why don &apos;t they have the same last name ?  they don &apos;t have the same last name . 
what kind of cancer ? 
oh ,  she &apos;s fine . 
 .  .  . what the fuck is this .  .  .  ? 
fuck you .   fuck you ,  you get out . 
yeah ,  but i don &apos;t know  -  - 
yeah . 
got some coffee brewing ,  huh ? 
yeah . 
i &apos;m gonna run to the bathroom real quick . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  claudia . 
i don &apos;t know .   i haven &apos;t thought about it  -  -  you know what  -  -  that &apos;s not true  -  -  i have thought about it .   i &apos;ve thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door . 
yeah . 
it &apos;s my favorite place  -  - 
 -  -  no ,  no ,  it &apos;s fine .  fine . 
it &apos;s fine . 
i &apos;m fine .  yes .  i &apos;m fine . 
where &apos;s richard and julia ? 
can you hold it ? 
give us your money ,  kid . 
dad  -  - 
you wanna take my statement ,  i &apos;ll perform for you ,  gotta get paid though ,  gotta get paid . 
have you ever been to juvenille hall ? 
what ?   what does that mean ? 
picky ,  picky . 
brad ,  i know you don &apos;t love me now  -  - 
i paid you back . 
what is that ? 
i &apos;ve been a good worker  -  - 
 -  -  he &apos;s fucking dying ,  he &apos;s dying as we &apos;re sitting here and there isn &apos;t a fucking thing  -  -  jesus ,  how can you tell me to calm down ? 
 -  -  you don &apos;t understand :  it &apos;s more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren &apos;t working ,  he &apos;s  -  -  past two days it &apos;s like he can &apos;t really swallow them and i don &apos;t know if they &apos;re going down  -  -  i can &apos;t see inside his mouth anymore  -  -  i &apos;m up all night staring at him and i don &apos;t think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts  -  - 
this is the number for hospice .  ok .  now .  as far as the morphine pills go ,  there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in ,  there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine .  .  .  . it &apos;s a little bottle ,  with an eye dropper and it &apos;s easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back ,  i mean ,  it will certainly cure his pain ,  but he will float in and out of consciousness ,  even worse than he is now ,  linda .   i mean ,  any sign of the recognizable earl will pretty much go away  -  - 
 .  .  . ah .  .  . maybe .  .  . yeah .  .  . she &apos;s a good one .  .  . 
 &quot; yeah .  &quot;   the fuck do you know ? 
 .  .  . cocksucker .  .  .  . 
i &apos;m gonna start rolling  -  -

i would just want to clear some things up : 
we talked earlier about your mother .  and we talked about your father and his death .  and i don &apos;t want to be challenging or defeatist here ,  but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something  -  -  something that i understand  -  - 
do you remember a miss simms ? 
she does .   from when you were a boy . 
she lived in tarzana . 
yeah . 
where are you from originally ? 
the valley ? 
does you mother still work ?

you &apos;re my handsome man . 
no .   no . 
how many times .  .  .  . it &apos;s ok .  .  . just say .  .  .  just say .  .  . 
two years .  .  . three years .  .  . 
it &apos;s over becuase .  .  . for all the the right reasons i hope ,  what i said . 
i love you so much . 
you deserve to die alone for what you &apos;ve done . 
no ,  i &apos;m just a friend .   what are you doing here ,  i mean .  .  . you know claudia ? 
i can &apos;t . 
what would you like ? 
did you piss your fuckin &apos; pants ,  stanley ? 
why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day ? 
i got an audition ,  i won &apos;t make it here  &apos;till two ,  c &apos;mon ,  i &apos;ll see you later .  love you . 
 .  .  . oh jesus ,  what the fuck .  .  .  ? 
 .  . sorry .  .  . 
what is that ? 
 .  .  .  . what the fuck ,  what the fuck .  .  .  . 
god smiled upon us . 
oh god i  -  -  forgive me .  .  . 
there were two .   not one .   but two . 
what is it ,  mother ? 
why would you ask now ?   you never asked before ! 
louis ,  please  -  -   ! 
what had you to do with this ,  mother ? 
d &apos;artagnan ,  arrest them all ! 
it can .   i know the way . 
what are they doing ? 
porthos sleeps ,  and you plot .   don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time you told me what it is you are plotting ? 
then you are a fool  -  -  a fool who has never lost a son .   what gives you the right to judge me ,  to play god with the lives of others ?   is it because you are so much holier than everyone else ?  ! 
switch ?  !   that is your plan ?   it is ludicrous ! 
and people close to him ,  who  -  - 
poor phillippe ! 
a simple theological discussion . 
look at us .   we are old men now .   but once we were young .   and when we saw injustice ,  we fought it . 
pull them back ! 
i just said you &apos;re praying !   are you deaf too ?   i know you &apos;re blind ,  because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here ,  you &apos;d have tears in your eyes . 
i observe your forgiveness isn &apos;t sweeter than a plump nipple . 
aramis .  .  .  is this the way to hell ? 
but why ? 
d &apos;artagnan .   perhaps you should accept his offer ,  for we are dead anyway . 
d &apos;artagnan ,  unready ? 
what choice is there ?   if phillippe is in the bastille ,  then to the bastille we will go . 
but  -  -  are you sure ? 
fromberge .  .  .  ?  !   at the front ?  !   no . 
what hope is there ?   a wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king ,  and what chance is there of that ?   fromberge is on the battle line ,  and raoul  -  - 
i will also speak with the king ,  for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused . 
raoul is hurrying to the front ,  so i must hurry too . 
where are you going ? 
recent hours have been a shock . 
phillippe .  .  .  ? 
all this time .  .  .  i was a lost secret .   but you were hiding all your loyalty ,  all your love .   you were the man in the iron mask . 
the old man and woman called me .  .  .  phillippe . 
betrothed ?   i think not . 
continue . 
who was athos seeking ?   tell me !  did he try to enter the palace ? 
riots ?   my people live in the world &apos;s most beautiful city ,  their king has the grandest palaces on earth .   why should they feel anything but pride and contentment ? 
majesty .  .  .  we have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week .   if we distributed some of that ,  we would have time to gather more before  -  - 
from raoul .   he urges you to guard your honor  -  -  as if it could be in any danger .  .  .  from your king . 
our agency monitors all threats very carefully ,  and there &apos;s good reason to believe jim trudell has the training ,  the connections ,  and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large . 
i &apos;m sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth . 
it &apos;s marvosa  - 
yeah ? 
you can cut the shit ,  asshole -  - 
what did the six - toes have to say ? 
so ?  girls left bars with ted bundy too .  it doesn &apos;t rule out foul play . 
find out for me . 
if you can trail him to a remote area do it .  we all want a piece of him but let &apos;s keep our heads and stay within the law  -  we got people everywhere out here . 
so you must have known fleming .  .  .  and stanton  - 
alright ,  where is she ? 
anyhow .  .  .  you wake up and she &apos;s gone .  but -  -    -  - this is my favorite part -  -   she leaves you the keys to a brand new beemer . 
are you alright ? 
i was just having a little fun  - 
yeah ? 
and where the hell is marvosa ? 
why did you set me up ? 
i had it all on tape .  .  . 
oh ,  shit ,  shit ,  shit  -  i don &apos;t know about all this !  you sure ?  ! 
you gotta turn yourself in .  before it &apos;s too late  - 
shit ,  you know what happens to me if i &apos;m harboring a fugitive ?   i already think they &apos;re on to me !  i thought you were the phone police for chrissake ! 
i don &apos;t ,  but i &apos;m pretty sure .  it &apos;s a long story but i cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe .   if they start a trace it will be to a pic &apos;n &apos;save on pico . 
that was her  -  the girl .  .  .  we have to go . 
where did you learn to fight like that ?  jim  i read a book . 
ditched you ? 
what ? 
because i &apos;m professionally concerned about him .  and he &apos;d pick up on that .  he &apos;s fast .  he hates being prodded and poked .   so do i .   what do you want ? 
aniline dyes in the inks in felt - tip pens  -  -  which is what lecktor has  -  -  are transparent to infrared .  the tooth fairy &apos;s ballpoint isn &apos;t .  .  . 
where ? 
whatever i say ,  you &apos;ll take him away ,  won &apos;t you ? 
eighty - six so far .  all cranks .  he smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces .   none of them knew that;
that &apos;s not entirely true ,  will .  it &apos;s the way you think . 
he is good .  bur not as good as price . 
how &apos;d you know  &apos;broken mirrors ?  &apos; bribe a cop ?   tell it to the u . s .  attorney ,  lounds ! 
it &apos;s getting late and .  .  . 
parking permits .  .  . 
will .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;ll cover the back . 
how did you come to gateway ? 
good morning .  .  .   if you show me where things are ,  i &apos;ll make us some coffee .  .  . 
they &apos;ll make you be a piece of shit again .  they &apos;ll make you be a harelip again .  you better give me what i want ! 
do you see ? 
are you a man ? 
come in . 
yes ? 
put it down on my desk blotter and don &apos;t touch it again .  has anyone else handled it except you ? 
okay . 
he &apos;s white and six feet tall .  you haven &apos;t told me anything yet . 
the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr .  lecktor three years ago .   he killed nine people ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
no . 
it &apos;s me .  i &apos;ll call you tomorrow ,  sweetheart .  go back to sleep .   i love you .  .  . 
hello ,  hotshot ! 
to do what ? 
have you ever omitted telling me .  things before ? 
today &apos;s wednesday .  by friday i ought to .  .  . 
they don &apos;t want me up there .  every time they look at me i remind them .  .  .  if they thought about it ,  they &apos;d want you .  bur all they really want &apos;s the boy .  and they &apos;ll take you .   but they don &apos;t want to see me .  .  . 
maybe we should give it some time .  .  . 
yes .  is molly there ? 
thanks for the lift . 
yes .  who are you ? 
emotional problems ,  i hear .  he was a very promising young officer .  do you ever have any problems ,  will ?

we were just trying to push the envelope  -  - 
b - but .  .  .  we saw .  .  .  your neck .  .  .

my father said i should &apos;ve gotten a lawyer  -  -  !

it &apos;s so dirty . 
 &quot;  .  .  .  has been rushed to a nearby hospital ,  where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis .   his parents are at his bedside .   fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television &apos;s taxi &quot;  .  .  . 
i ,  i was asked to do this material  -   - 
i was very original ! 
well ,  call sag .   it &apos;d be cool to get one on the show .   i want the evening to build and build .   it &apos;s gonna have the most incredible ending :  singers ,  dancers ,  the  &quot; hallelujah chorus &quot;   -  -  then the sky opens ,  and santa claus comes flying down !

yes .   you see ,  the truth is ,  trinity ,  that we humans have a place in the future .   but it &apos;s not here .  it &apos;s in the matrix . 
goddamn you ,  cypher ! 
is that .  .  .  ? 
hello ? 
no way ,  no way ,  this is crazy . 
ironically ,  this is not far from the truth .   but i &apos;m getting ahead of myself .   can you tell me ,  neo ,  why are you here ? 
morpheus ,  what &apos;s happened to me ?  what is this place ? 
what ?   are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets ? 
and she &apos;s never wrong .

operator . 
operator . 
we went down to chinatown but they don &apos;t have any .

 &apos;my kingdom is not of this world .  if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that i might not be delivered to the jews .  but ,  as it is my kingdom is not from here .  &apos;

 &apos;joe .  .  .  &apos;

i &apos;m feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me .

i was a world - class loser and she was a happy ,  little rich girl  -  -  and for some reason she took me in . 
because there &apos;s nothing we don &apos;t know about each other and it &apos;s okay .  i mean the deeper ,  darkest secrets  -  -  they don &apos;t matter . 
do you think i should wait to tell him  &apos;till after the party ? 
no ,  joe ,  i &apos;m swimming here .   then i &apos;m going home . 
i have to go ,  i &apos;m sorry to say  -  -

there &apos;s one to every rule . 
would you like to sit down ,  joe ? 
 .  .  . i &apos;d like to be alone for a while . 
joe ,  could i ask you to take a walk ?  buy a tie or something .   i know i &apos;ll be seeing you . 
why ,  at this juncture ,  are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters ? 
hello ,  bill . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  bill  -  - 
what  &apos;okay &apos; is ,  it &apos;s  &apos;okay &apos; it &apos;s over .   we &apos;ve got bigger fish to fry ,  don &apos;t we ,  joe ? 
yes ,  i saw you see me . 
i &apos;ll be the judge of that . 
 &apos;spooning &apos; ? 
thanks . 
i love her ,  bill .   she is all that i ever wanted ,  and i &apos;ve never wanted for anything because i &apos;ve never wanted anything before ,  if you can understand . 
so that &apos;s what love is ? 
i told you to shut up . 
the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou .  they were convinced that bontecou ,  on past deals ,  had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus -  picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for .   the irs wanted to go after him ,  and this deal offered them the opportunity .   i agreed to cooperate . 
that &apos;s me . 
when i introduce you ,  if i say who you are ,  i don &apos;t think anyone will stay for dinner . 
about what ? 
what the hell are you talking about ? 
 .  .  . i read you all the way on the bontecou thing ,  and i know where you &apos;re coming from .   and i &apos;m with you a hundred and one percent . 
joe knew the whole story .   i told him .   it was his idea that i come clean .   i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls ,  you know what i mean ? 
not my birthday again ? 
 .  .  . there &apos;s a start for a meeting . 
do you love drew ? 
oh yes ,  i am .   not an ounce of excitement ,  not a whisper of a thrill ,  this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice . 
well ,  it worries me .   i want you to get swept away .   i want you to levitate .   i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish . 
well ,  go get  &apos;em ,  pops . 
it &apos;ll come back ,  daddy . 
that was wonderful . 
do you mind if i raise a little caution flag ? 
i won &apos;t say you may be getting onto shaken ground  -  - 
where &apos;s joe ? 
but what ? 
daddy  -  - 
good morning ,  i was talking kind of loud there ,  sorry . 
how &apos;d you know ? 
yes ,  i could .   i have an office in the hospital . 
not at all . 
i &apos;ve got to go  -  - 
sure ,  i &apos;ll give you the name of a doctor .    .  .  . and i don &apos;t want to examine you . 
 .  .  . we know so little about each other . 
39 . 
30 . 
hiya . 
you said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them .  don &apos;t you remember ? 
so you &apos;re holding my calls ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  i think i &apos;m checked in here ,  but i &apos;ve misplaced my key . 
leonard ,  it &apos;s burt from the front desk . 
yeah ,  but there &apos;s a call for you from this guy .  he &apos;s a cop . 
what ? 
i haven &apos;t made a strong enough impression . 
have i told you what this man did ?     *
calm down .  you &apos;re not into anything .  it was my problem ,  you offered no help .  it &apos;s got nothing to do with your investigation . 
you decided to help me .  trust yourself .  trust your own judgment .  you can question everything ,  you can never know anything for sure . 
such as ? 
what do the police think ? 
he didn &apos;t believe me .  he said that if i don &apos;t get him the money tomorrow he &apos;s gonna kill me .  then he started hitting me . 
i &apos;m not . 
my name &apos;s leonard .         *
yeah ,  but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next  - 
why ? 
you &apos;re living . 
discount inn .  don &apos;t know what room; haven &apos;t got my key . 
prove it . 
why &apos;s that ? 
what do you mean  &quot; bad news &quot;  ? 
guys who &apos;ll come after her .  guys who &apos;ll want to know what happened to her boyfriend .  they &apos;ll want to make somebody pay .  maybe she &apos;ll try and make it you . 
she couldn &apos;t . 
she has no idea who i am . 
happy now ? 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
he might have fallen down the stairs ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ,  i &apos;m confused .  i have this memory thing  -  do i know you ? 
this is a drug deal ?  ! 
i dunno .  .  .  your wife surviving the assault .  .  .  her not believing about your condition .  .  .  the doubt tearing her up inside .  .  ,  the insulin  - 
my wife wasn &apos;t diabetic . 
what cop ? 
she &apos;s sending a message .   meth lab .  trailer park .   anything with interesting antenna arrays .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . eliminated one .   swat &apos;s on the next two .  .  . 
where &apos;s the new drop point .  .  .  ? 
what do you think ? 
we &apos;re not certain .  .  . 
all i want to know is the where and the when .   spare me mini moves ,  progress reports and bullshit . 
how many ? 
we want it back . 
where &apos;s that ? 
the keys ? 
 .  .  .  &apos;cause we have no future .  .  . are of today and not tomorrow . 
like .  .  .  ? 
and why should continuing excellence cost more ? 
the range should be between fifteen and seventeen - point - five percent of the p . o . e .  .  .  . to even consider it . 
everybody needs it .   ask prudential .   or allstate . 
you afraid of violence ? 
he didn &apos;t .   interrogation &apos;s not in our skill set .   so c &apos;mon ,  what suspicions have you master - minded off these associations ? 
yeah ? 
proof of life .   how do i know mrs .  rico &apos;s alive ? 
white gangs .  .  .  ?   it doesn &apos;t track .

just what ? 
the prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the high court in ankara reviewed it . 
best way is get your ass out .  .  .  any .  .  .  way .  .  .  you can .  .  . 
yeah ,   for the criminally insane .   i was there once for two weeks and it ain &apos;t an illusion .  it &apos;s awful .  namidou runs it like a death camp ,  that &apos;s where he spends most of his time .  .  .

not just any carbohydrates ,  mind you .  it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex .   we should get a strobe on this thing .  maybe even a siren . 
go left .   go left again till you hit the fork .  .  .  then right again .  you got that ? 
for chrissakes ,  what &apos;s the problem ?  you need a memo every time you fart ? 
a mistake . 
what are you doing down here ? 
what &apos;s manny doing ?  i can &apos;t see him anymore . 
but the power .  .  . 
it would take a minute or so .   you won &apos;t last that long out there . 
he didn &apos;t do it ! 
just inner chambers .  .  . 
he &apos;s out there .  i heard him .  how can he be ?  this things .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t protect him ,  lady .  he trusted me .  and i didn &apos;t protect him .  .  .  his father .  .  . i lost his father to the streets and now ,  chuy .  .  . 
do you think we did the right thing ? 
i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids . 
oh ,  no ,  you were - 
 .  .  . as long as they &apos;re ready for the opening i don &apos;t care ,  just tell them that . 
it bit you . 
excuse me ,  that &apos;s not exactly the kind of information i was after .  you see ,  he &apos;s been missing for quite some time now ,  and .  .  . 
your legs just sing grand opera when you move ,  don &apos;t they ?   it &apos;s not going to hurt forever ,  paul ,  i promise you . 
what are you doing on the floor ?   it &apos;s my fault .  if i &apos;d had a proper hospital bed ,  this never would have happened .  here ,  let me help you back in .   i know this hurts ,  but it &apos;ll only take a few seconds .  there you go .  comfy ? 
but this time i thought clearly .  i asked god about you and god said  &quot; i delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way .  &quot; 
you want me to burn my book ? 
yes .  it will be a book in my honor .  for saving your life and nursing you back to health .  i &apos;ll be the first one to read it .   oh ,  paul ,  you &apos;re going to make me the envy of the whole world .  .  . 
here ,  in case you think of any ideas . 
 &quot; he didn &apos;t get out of the cockadoodie car !  &quot; 
what &apos;s the matter ,  paul ?  you haven &apos;t written a word . 
don &apos;t be silly .  of course you can . 
you can -  - you have the  &quot; gotta &quot;  -  - 
i hope you like it . 
the book is almost finished .  your legs are getting better .  soon you &apos;ll be able to walk .  you &apos;ll be wanting to leave . 
now don &apos;t fuss ,  paul . 
oh ,  paul .  it &apos;s beautiful . 
the stranger staying at the inn ,  is he someone from misery &apos;s past ? 
yes ,  paul . 
no ,  no ,  of course not .  it &apos;s just that his daughter hasn &apos;t heard from him ,  and when he &apos;s got a book coming out ,  he usually keeps in touch .  so when there was no word from him .  .  . 
hey ,  pete . 
answer me a couple things ? 
you wouldn &apos;t happen to remember if miz wilkes bought one ,  would you ? 
the word i &apos;m getting is the times review is gonna be a love letter . 
you &apos;re not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair - splitting nuance ,  are you ? 
where is it ? 
i said you &apos;re beautiful ,  nyah . 
sean ,  there &apos;s something i &apos;ve been meaning to talk to you about .  .  .  isn &apos;t going to be easy for me to say . 
a change of plans ? 
oh ,  no ,  not at all .   maybe just a bit . 
fight a bit of a cold .  . 
i would &apos;ve thought the hardest part was exercising restraint .   curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off .   you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 ,  you never figured out where the virus really was . 
what was the top bid ? 
 -  -  now here &apos;s the way it &apos;s going to work .  . wallis ,  the shares outstanding are .  . 
ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar .  big bloke ,  ginger hair .  they &apos;re into something . 
i &apos;m missing something here ,  aside from a 500 , 000 pound necklace .   even after i botched the job ,  i could &apos;ve walked out of there with the bloody thing . 
i need your help and i thin you can use mine . 
that &apos;s lot of people out there .  . how many of them ,  i wonder ,  are capable of something like that ? 
but i don &apos;t have a conscience .   i &apos;m a bloody thief . 
and that &apos;s the only reason ? 
how &apos;s it going ?   everything okay ? 
where do i meet you ? 
no . 
when i couldn &apos;t find you ,  i had to replace you .   sean ambrose was the obvious choice .  he double you ,  what ?   two ,  three times ? 
what did you think of him ? 
so there &apos;s one thing we know ambrose doesn &apos;t . 
sean feels he hasn &apos;t done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground . 
 &apos;terrorists ?  &apos;
 -  good .   then if you manage to get hold of ambrose ,  and obtain what he &apos;s got ,  you &apos;ve got  -    -  8 hours 57 minutes and twenty - three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of chimera on earth . 
sorry ,  ethan .   i don &apos;t quite know where to begin .   any suggestions ? 
why not ?   you &apos;ve done just about everything else on this operation . 
of course it was .   anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do ,  is bound to get a little flak here and there .   you try flogging the stories on cnn i &apos;ve had to come up with about what &apos;s been going on around here the last few days .   at any rate ,  it &apos;s been most instructive  -  -  what they &apos;ll swallow ,  or what they &apos;ll broadcast with a straight face .   miss hall &apos;s blood ,  it appears ,  has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus .   not even antibodies . 
and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose . 
i do . 
i don &apos;t .   no exactly . 
they &apos;re ready and waiting .   you &apos;ll soon be with old friends . 
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules .   in the myth ,  bellerophon killed chimera ,  a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world .   i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon . 
luther .  . get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on bruny island last month ,  including photos of the victims . 
ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope ,  put it in his inner left jacket pocket .  .  . 
roger that . 
ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane ,  but he didn &apos;t get the chimera virus . 
thirty - second opening in the roof and a 250 - foot drop . 
you still don &apos;t get it ,  do you ?   you want to make an omelet ,  you break a few eggs  -  i needed to know just how bad the disease was< / i>  -  in the real world ,  not the lab .   and you never know til you try .   you thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas .   but i saw you creating a disease so terrible in chimera< / i> that the cure would be priceless . 
well ,  the thought had occurred to me .   i needed chimera in order to peddle bellerophon .   for hero to be appreciated ,  you need a monster .  now that &apos;s not so difficult to understand ,  is it ?   look ,  time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo !   not anymore !  .  . have you any idea the r&d money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that &apos;s barely effective against one strain of one bacterium ?   if i couldn &apos;t makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there ,  you &apos;d help me put one out there i can make on !  .  . there it is .   i &apos;ve confessed .   i ,  john c .  mccloy ,  am in business to make money .   lilly &apos;s making billions feeding prozac to depressed dogs .   pfizer doesn &apos;t even know where to put the money they &apos;re making on viagra ,  and let me tell you that shit didn &apos;t do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose ,  jesus ,  who do i have to screw to get a a break !  .  . now get me out of here ,  get me treated and let &apos;s go back to work !  .  . 
to friends . 
you and i know about this  -  -  and that &apos;s where it stops .   understand ?   it never happened . 
only four more cars . 
satisfied ? 
dont jim . 
sarah &apos;s reconsidering .   claire ,  transport in five minutes . 
ethan  -  -  ethan ,  it &apos;s okay .   it &apos;s claire .  ethan what &apos;s wrong with you ? 
shut up !   i saw you .   you were in the car . 
there was nobody on the bridge . 
the message is for job . 
two cars .   where are you ? 
claire .  .  . hey .  .  . 
are you damaged ? 
you seem hell bent on blaming yourself ,  ethan . 
since your father &apos;s death ,  your family &apos;s farm has been in sub - chapter s and now ,  suddenly ,  they &apos;re flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank .  dad &apos;s illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account  -  -  dying slowly in america after all ,  can be a very expensive proposition ethan .   so ,  why don &apos;t we go quietly out of here onto the plane .  .  . 
what are we downloading ? 
i &apos;m not letting this list get out in the open . 
really ?   and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you ? 
on what ? 
very good . 
ha ,  dear boy !   i do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private . 
wait !   hold it  -  it &apos;s on .  let &apos;s go . 
zero body count . 
would you remove your hat please ? 
then what am i doing here ? 
i &apos;m willing to take the chance . 
yeah ,  well ,  jim ,  fact is i &apos;ve got more than ninety days leave coming . 
ive got a shadow . 
hey ,  i showed  &apos;em to you ! 
jim .  .  .  ? 
arent you going to thank me jim .   ten million is better than six . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
try it again . 
very good ,  mr .  johnny . 
i forgot to bring the champagne ,  mr .  johnny . 
where you been ? 
okay . 
hi .   hi . 
he &apos;s flying to sicily .  his mother &apos;s dying . 
you &apos;ve got to come .  you &apos;ve got to give me away . 
the man understood me .  the woman wanted to be cheap ,  but the man saw that i was right . 
oh ,  cosmo ! 
i won &apos;t have to shoot those dogs .  they will kill each other . 
why didn &apos;t he call himself ? 
have you come from my brother ? 
i have no life . 
it &apos;s wood .  it &apos;s fake .  five years ago i was engaged to be married .  johnny came in here ,  he ordered bread from me .  i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn &apos;t paying attention .  the slicer chewed off my hand .  it &apos;s funny  &apos;cause  -  when my fianc saw that i was maimed ,  she left me for another man . 
that &apos;s it . 
i don &apos;t know . 
how many men since then ? 
i don &apos;t care about luck ,  you understand me ?  it ain &apos;t that . 
what are you doing ! 
to the bed . 
i can &apos;t believe what is happening . 
i &apos;ve got you . 
you &apos;re invited to the wedding !  it &apos;s in a few weeks .  why didn &apos;t you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo ? 
you don &apos;t get along with anybody ! 
i &apos;m telling you you can &apos;t . 
who painted that ? 
so .  where are we sitting ? 
this is where we &apos;re going ! 
let me go home . 
bye ,  aunt rita . 
it &apos;s the oily fish tonight .  not before the plane ride . 
will you marry me ? 
you know i was married and that my husband died .  but what you don &apos;t know is i think he and i had bad luck . 
yes ,  on the floor . 
what about the wedding ? 
i don &apos;t know .  but johnny ,  how did your mother recover ?  she was dying . 
johnny ,  i have something to tell you . 
in time ,  you will see that this is the best thing . 
what the hell happened to you ? 
your hair &apos;s different . 
hi . 
listen ,  i gotta go .  i &apos;ll take the deposit to the bank but i &apos;ll do the books tomorrow .  i gotta go . 
bless me ,  father ,  for i have sinned .  it &apos;s been two months since my last confession . 
twice i took the name of god in vain ,  once i slept with the brother of my fianc ,  and once i bounced a check at the liquor store  -  -  but that was really an accident . 
i know . 
don &apos;t fight . 
maybe i should go ? 
my mother &apos;s recovered . 
who was that ? 
have you come to make peace with me ? 
don &apos;t mind about me .  but could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her ,  and bring me a big glass of vodka ? 
sorry .  that was rude . 
yes . 
we could go to my apartment .  you could see how the other half lives . 
it &apos;s a house . 
look . 
i feel great i got no sleep but i feel like orlando furioso ! 
you got me . 
a witch ,   a witch ,   burn her ! 
i see .   yes ,  of course . 
what ?   ridden on a horse ? 
are you suggesting coconuts migrate ? 
there is much danger  .  .  .  for beyond the cave lies the gorge of eternal peril which no man has ever crossed . 
seek you the bridge of death  .  .  . 
dennis !  there &apos;s some lovely filth down here  .  .  .   oh !  how d &apos;you do ? 
please ,  please good people .   i am in haste .   what knight lives in that castle ? 
what is that ? 
i move for no man . 
i am king arthur and these are the knights of the round table .   whose castle is this ? 
what with ? 
who are they ? 
look ,  you &apos;re a busy man  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  must be approved at a bi - weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs . 
come and see the violence inherent in the system .  help ,  help ,  i &apos;m being repressed ! 
yes ,  lord . 
what is your name ? 
i think i &apos;ll be all right to come with you ,  sir . 
did you kill all those guards ? 
oh dear ,  i didn &apos;t really mean to .  .  . 
gosh  -  is he all right ? 
listen ,  lad ,  i built this kingdom up from nothing .   all i had when i started was swamp  .  .  .   other kings said i was daft to build a castle on a swamp ,  but i built it all the same  .  .  .  just to show  &apos;em .  it sank into the swamp .   so i built a another one  .  .  .  that sank into the swamp .   i built another one  .  .  .   that fell over and then sank into the swamp  .  .  .  .   so i built another  .  .  .  and that stayed up .   .  .  .  and that &apos;s what your gonna get ,  lad :  the most powerful kingdom in this island . 
how ? 
make sure the prince doesn &apos;t leave this room until i come and get him . 
where are you going ? 
no ,  i want you to stay here and make sure he doesn &apos;t leave the room until i get back . 
we are just not used to handsome knights  .  .  .   but you are wounded ! 
well ,   what seems to be the trouble ? 
no look ,  really ,  this isn &apos;t nescess  .  .  . 
oh ,  fair one ,  behold your humble servant ,  sir launcelot ,  from the court of camelot .   i have come to take you  .  .  .   away  .  .  .  i &apos;m terribly sorry  .  .  . 
it &apos;s only grief makes her like she is . 
and she sent no word down ? 
she &apos;ll get over it . 
aye ,  she may say that to you ,  but the woman can say what she wants . 
come on ,  man ,  i &apos;m telling you what you already know . 
it &apos;s what the maids are for . 
checked and locked ,  sir . 
if it is inconvenient to her majesty ,  then perhaps she might consider allowing the prince of wales to host -  - 
mr .  carter ,  the head butler ,  sits there . 
the order of seating at the upper servant &apos;s table is arranged personally by the queen herself . 
there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries .   no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household . 
if i find out that you had anything to do with this ,  i will have you sacked . 
this is a slur on her good name . 
still ,  someone must attend you .   your wife should not have let you out . 
but yourself ?   what about john brown ? 
so .  .  .  ? 
they don &apos;t see it . 
too busy looking after themselves . 
you are well ? 
your family sent cards .   it was much appreciated . 
those ,  over there ,  there . 
i am thinking of publishing my  &quot; highland journals .  &quot; 
i am told so . 
we took a nip of whiskey . 
what can we do ? 
then they may read about me . 
i see the prince of wales is here . 
what did he want ? 
he appears to be  .  .  .  standing by his horse . 
he thought ,  perhaps ,  your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government . 
no - one should think themselves wiser than me !   it is not for any of the queen &apos;s subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning .   it is the queen &apos;s sorrow that keeps her secluded !   it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility ,  work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely ! 
there is one other matter . 
then why are you not with him ? 
the next half of the game takes place in arcade &apos;s brain ,  the city of truth .  it &apos;s urban scenarios ,  lots of metal and concrete .  screamer comes faster here .   on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world .   gotta time it right though .

thanks .  .  .  . 
i don &apos;t need you to be telling me to .  .  . 
my parents had a brief ,  but intensely fulfilling relationship .  she &apos;s remained a woman of mystery to this day . 
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either . 
i never did understand that story ,  did someone find the needle or not ? 
it &apos;s the leather bindings ,  i love the fragrance of vintage books . 
get married ?

how about nick ?  did he take good care of you ? 
she lives here too ?

well i &apos;m sort of involved . 
lizt was my parents &apos; favorite ,  they were hungarian .

i &apos;m a licensed cosmetologist ,  i worked for two years ,  at the &quot;dino raphael&quot; salon ,  all my customers cried when i told them i was leaving . 
harry ?   i was just wondering ,  if there is anything wrong with vada . 
after my wife died ,  grammoo moved in here to help take care of vada .  they were very close ,  but lately as her mind &apos;s been wandering more and more ,  vada &apos;s been acting kinda crazy .  i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll snap out of it though . 
oh right ,  right ,   .  bader lorenzo died june 22 1972 devoted husband to nicolette .  cherished father of babritzio and heidi ,  in lieu of flowers ,  please send donations to the holy names society .

you better not either . 
blood oath . 
you think .  .  . 
what i mean ,  when i say annoyingly perfect ,  is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection .  it is vulnerable and endearing .  and that is annoying as shit . 
i don &apos;t know the meaning of the word guilt ! 
i am breaking her heart in the short run ,  but doing her a gigantic favor !  she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus ! 
two words . 
i &apos;m taking my next book to viking . 
needing . 
tell him you know this is the worst ,  dumbest ,  cruelest moment to do this to him .   but there it is ,  and he has to choose . 
my heart &apos;s in my throat ,  here .  right off ,  i have to ask this monstrous favor .  .  . 
the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty .  identical twin debutantes from nashville ,  who are basically vengeful sluts .   with amazing bodies ! 
so it &apos;s sweet of you to be protective .  .  . 
jesus ,  we &apos;re trapped ! 
it &apos;s not just clubs .   this guy always knows the best everything .  the best guitar store ,  the best beef ribs ,  the best horowitz record ,  was he always like the .  .  . 
gold dog collars ?  they don &apos;t have dogs . 
so .  .  .  one almost has to .  .  . 
in six months ,  he &apos;ll be happy ,  settled ,  successful .  .  . 
when are you gonna come clean with your folks ? 
if he gives you grief ,  i &apos;ll have him skillfully beaten ,  where the wounds won &apos;t show . 
they both have some growing up to do .   but they &apos;re good people ,  they &apos;re starting with love .  they &apos;ve got time . 
i think he &apos;s been fired . 
and you think he &apos;s kept this to himself . 
i &apos;ve been calling for days ! 
well ,  that &apos;s great .   you haven &apos;t really had anybody since dingbat jennylee .  .  . 
best everything ,  joe .   but i &apos;m going to dance with you . 
luckily .   the closer i watched ,  the more the fault came into focus .   each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability . 
how can you trust someone you can never mistrust ? 
you &apos;ve sort of been .  .  .  y &apos;know ,  the woman in my life . 
i wouldn &apos;t know .   i never had that many first thoughts .

what &apos;s going on ? 
do you mind me not saying  -  -  it &apos;s a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away . 
am i to take it that there isn &apos;t a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter ?   mister harding ,  you &apos;ve stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men .

there &apos;s this poem by rilke ,  i don &apos;t remember the whole thing ,  but it &apos;s about that .   about waiting for that person ,  and wondering if you &apos;ll ever find them .   and the last line of it goes ,   &quot; who knows ?   perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us ,  yesterday -  - 
oh ,  right .   dwayne .   you &apos;re engaged to dwayne ? 
you don &apos;t think this is just infatuation ,  do you ? 
i &apos;m engaged .   i &apos;m supposed to be married in two days . 
and ,  he &apos;s a friend of yours .   it &apos;s dwayne . 
a very large pig . 
yeah ,  but ,  what if he doesn &apos;t live here ?   like ,  what if he &apos;s a cannibal in new guinea or something ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  it &apos;s a long story ,  but i know who he is .   i know where to find him . 
smoking or non - smoking ? 
why are you asking me this ? 
it &apos;s in the south .   i &apos;ve still got my rental car .   i can get you there by morning .  .  . 
he &apos;s out by the pool right now . 
and she &apos;s a knock - out ,  too . 
hey -  - 
well ,  how about those old romantic movies with those great stars ,  huh ?  like audrey hepburn . 
yeah .   well ,  was the least i could do . 
promise me you won &apos;t leave without saying goodbye . 
is something the matter ? 
reptilian swine .   there &apos;s no such thing .   reptiles aren &apos;t swine . 
alright .   the truth is .  .  .  i thought we had something here . 
and i can &apos;t believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger ,  some phantom you &apos;ve never even met destroy it . 
aren &apos;t you going to tell me who you are ? 
so ,  you say you &apos;ve been to italy before ? 
metaphorically ,  i still don &apos;t have an amana freezer . 
what &apos;s he do ? 
he begged me to marry him .   i didn &apos;t even want to marry him . 
but one day you wake up and realize you &apos;ve been had .   of course life isn &apos;t like the movies .   that &apos;s why there are movies . 
kate ,  is something the matter ? 
would you stop saying that ?   i need you to do me a really big favor . 
this is a lifestyles hotel . 
just once more ,  so you &apos;ll be sure to know what to look for . 
a butterfinger wrapper . 
he went out and bought himself men &apos;s cologne the other day .   did i tell you that ? 
he &apos;s sitting in the fourth booth down ,  on the left hand side ,  with his back to us .   he &apos;s wearing a navy jacket .   if you turn around ,  you can see part of his right elbow . 
faith -  - 
hi - iii .  .  . 
it was a ouija board ,  remember ? 
maybe if i kiss him i &apos;ll feel it . 
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep . 
you are looking for a place to stay ,  no ,  kate ? 
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is .   can you tell us what she &apos;s saying ? 
oh . 
not only is it tacky ,  it &apos;s exploitation . 
i have to talk to her . 
and then i saw her .   and all i know is ,  when i looked in her eyes i saw something .  .  .  light .   and life and passion and yearning .   and something else i can &apos;t even put my finger on ,  something i &apos;d never seen before -  - 
and what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it ? 
you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty - five thousand ,  five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records ? 
well ,  where are they ? 
what gives with our boy tonight ,  charley ?  he ain &apos;t himself . 
it &apos;ll do . 
you said they was only going to talk to him . 
johnny does you favors ,  kid .  you got to do a little one for him once in a while . 
mmhmm . 
you don &apos;t mean you &apos;re thinking of testifying against 
i tell you ,  charley ,  i haven &apos;t made up my mind ! 
it wasn &apos;t him !   it was you ,  charley .  you and johnny .  like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says ,   &quot; kid ,  this ain &apos;t your night we &apos;re going for the price on wilson .  &quot;  it ain &apos;t my night .  i &apos;d of taken wilson apart that night !  i was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations .  so what happens this bum wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark !   and what do i get a couple of bucks and a one - way ticket to palookaville .   it was you ,  charley .  you was my brother .  you should of looked out for me .  instead of making me take them dives for the short - end money . 
it was you ,  charley .  .  .   . 
they &apos;re waiting for him to walk in . 
i think we &apos;re o . k . 
i want to be a teacher . 
what &apos;s that ? 
thanks anyway . 
he had a few birds .   i got up and fed  &apos;em this morning . 
were you really a prize fighter ? 
his racket ? 
you &apos;re not sore at me ? 
i &apos;ve been sittin &apos; in the church . 
my pigeons .  .  .   . 
who is he !  edie ,  you &apos;re so softhearted and soft - headed you wouldn &apos;t recognize the devil if he had you by the throat .  you know who this terry malloy is ?  the kid brother of charlie the gent ,  johnny friendly &apos;s right hand ,  a butcher in a camel hair coat . 
six - toed cats .  assyrians .  abyssinians .  it &apos;s the same difference .  well don &apos;t think this terry malloy is any six - toed cockeyed assyrian .  he &apos;s a bum .  charley and johnny friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action . 
you think we kept you out in tarrytown just to have you go walkin &apos; with a corner saloon hoodlum like terry malloy ?  now get back to tarrytown ,  before i put a strap to you . 
it started as a favor for my brother you know they &apos;d ask me things and it &apos;s hard to say no a favor who am i kiddin &apos; ?  they call it a favor but it &apos;s do it or else .  and this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off joey .  i just thought they &apos;d lean on him a little but last night with edie i wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat .  i guess i was scared of drivin &apos; her away and i love her ,  father .  she &apos;s the first thing i ever loved . 
your gun . 
give me that gun . 
 .  .  . walk ? 
you can ! 
now listen ,  if you know who the pistols are ,  if you see them on the dock every day ,  are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one ?   are you ?  are you ?  how about you ,  nolan ? 
what do you think ? 
never will be much too soon . 
be at the state house ,  courtroom nine ,  at ten o &apos;clock tomorrow . 
i guess it &apos;s pretty tough work at that . 
yeah .  johnny friendly and my brother had other ideas . 
give me a double . 
well i got to watch myself these days .  know what i mean ? 
hey ,  skins   -  - get away with that sheet metal all right ? 
count this . 
go on a little present from your uncle johnny .   and mac ,  tomorra mornin &apos; when you shape the men put terry in the loft .  number one .  every day .   nice easy work .  check in and goof off on the coffee bags .  o . k .  ? 
i i was just on my way up ,  johnny . 
nothing happened ,  he says .  some operator you got yourself there ,  charley .  one more like him and we &apos;ll all be wearing striped pajamas . 
oh ,  he did .  half an hour later a certain timothy j .  nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking . 
go on beat it .  don &apos;t push your luck . 
you know what i mean .  leave her alone . 
a dime ,  terry ,  a dime for a cup of coffee ? 
you think one bottle &apos;s enough for all them toasts ? 
the brother of charley the gent .  they &apos;ll help us get to the bottom of the river . 
you don &apos;t think he &apos;d be helpful ? 
but horror stories !   why all the time horror stories ? 
i &apos;m getting the jitters !  let &apos;s turn back ! 
something &apos;s making that music . 
can &apos;t we get out of here ? 
i &apos;m so frightened . 
the ropes are coming loose . 
my guess is if we don &apos;t take the chance pretty soon ,  we &apos;re not going to have much life left anyway . 
i love you bob .  i really do .  forgive me ? 
you love me then ? 
what kind of symbol ? 
she was ? 
oh ,  yes ,  a religion of sorts . 
there are others . 
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session . 
your pleasures of course ! 
you may take her now . 
you better hope there is . 
live ones where only the dead should be ? 
have we in some way made you angry ,  master ? 
hurt her ?   hell ,  it killed her ! 
what do you suppose for ? 
did you howl off - key at the moon again ? 
what happened to mandrake the magician ? 
listen ,  adele ,  the reason i called ,  that party is today instead of sunday .  about eight - thirty ,  like only a few hours from now .   so you &apos;ll have to get hold of buddy ,  whatever he might be doing .  .  . 
oh ,  is this adele ? 
lie face down on the floor . 
you were both< / i> in the trunk ?   together ? 
but you know what i &apos;m talking about ,  don &apos;t you ?   about glenn ,  don &apos;t you ,  and the second car ? 
why not ? 
but you spoke to him on the phone . 
he called the day he escaped . 
he said he wished the two of you could start over ,  live a normal life . 
adele ?   you in there ? 
you say you perform in the miami area ? 
wait in the hall !   i have to get dressed ! 
we may as well leave her ,  we &apos;re leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway ,  what &apos;s the difference where ? 
i &apos;m just saying she wasn &apos;t scared . 
you &apos;re just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you . 
i know exactly what you mean .   it &apos;s just a feeling .   you know ,  i could go for some wine tonight . 
they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want ,  nobody &apos;ll know you . 
think this old guy is her boyfriend ?  it &apos;s the only picture she carries . 
longer we hang around down here ,  jack ,  better chance there is either glenn &apos;s gonna fuck up the whole score ,  or we gonna get busted ,  or both . 
 &quot; fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying .  &quot;   seems this woman &apos;s live - in boyfriend ,  seventy years old ,  complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve - gauge .   police found noodles in the woman &apos;s hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him .   they &apos;d been together ten years . 
outside of that . 
you tell your sister about it ? 
you didn &apos;t tell your sister about ripley ,  did you ?    &apos;cause i don &apos;t wanna go through that again . 
now that &apos;s a really big house . 
let glenn deal with the snoop ,  while we &apos;re off livin &apos; the good life . 
so how &apos;s that work ,  a wanted felon socializing with a u . s .  marshal ? 
so what &apos;s that mean ?   that you &apos;re disappointed by what you found or you &apos;re sorry you robbed all those banks ? 
no ,  you dump the van ,  meet me at the airport .  i &apos;ll take one of ripley &apos;s cars . 
this fella holds you hostage ,  you talk about movies ? 
you say in the report glenn didn &apos;t have a gun ,  but you let him get away ,  too . 
we &apos;ll talk another time ,  karen .   all right ?   i &apos;d like to know why foley put you in that second car when he didn &apos;t need you any more . 
i &apos;m at adele delisi &apos;s . 
sure ,  daniel . 
yes or no ,  daniel .   if i get him ,  will you let me go after foley ? 
take the radio ,  stay down here in the lobby ,  watch the elevator . 
you excited ? 
you want ,  i tole you you can come .  you all right ,  foley .   i like you . 
you see what they doing ,  those posts out there ?   putting up another fence ,  five metres on the other side of the one that &apos;s there .   we wait until super bowl sunday ,  they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine ,  ten days .   so we going soon as it &apos;s dark .   you want  -  -  i mean it  -  -  you can still come . 
you know ,  i &apos;m not in homicide any more . 
who &apos;s sitting here ? 
the fuck you talking about ? 
look ,  what you worried about glenn for ?   what &apos;s he know ? 
how many was that ? 
you don &apos;t seem all that scared . 
that part in the movie where they get shot ?   warren beatty and .  .  .  i can &apos;t think of her name . 
yeah ,  i liked her in that movie about tv .  .  . 
you know who this is ? 
how &apos;d you get this number ? 
something i &apos;ve been wondering ,  what ever happened to your uncle cully ? 
oh ,  god .  .  . 
remember how talkative you were ?   in the trunk ?   adele said you do that when you &apos;re nervous . 
you kept touching me ,  feeling my thigh . 
i might &apos;ve smelled like a sewer ,  but you could tell i was a gentleman .  they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy . 
what were you gonna do with me ? 
you &apos;re not dumb . 
if you don &apos;t ,  one of those guys will . 
what happened to your shades ?   someone finally step on  &apos;em ? 
i hear six . 
you &apos;re smart ,  ripley ,  you &apos;ll tell this guy to fuck off . 
thanks for your help . 
you &apos;re the reason ,  jack ,  i don &apos;t keep all my money in banks . 
yeah ,  but who &apos;s gonna believe glenn ?  i mean ,  do you< / u> believe glenn ? 
i can &apos;t say that i &apos;ve paid that much attention to  &apos;em before . 
jesus christ ,  what the hell are you doing here ?   what &apos;s going on ?   who &apos;s upstairs ? 
what do you want from me ,  jack ?   name it .   you want money ? 
hejira ? < / i>  what kinda name is that ?

glenn ,  i know your life history ,  who your friends are ,  where you &apos;ve been and now ,  it looks like ,  where you &apos;re going .   put your hands on the wheel . 
but i thought the whole thing was your idea ? 
you there ? 
watch the road ,  boy .   i like this town car .   we can cruise the man &apos;s neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass . 
i don &apos;t know  -  -  the gym ,  the fights .  i know< / i> he don &apos;t miss the fights .   having some tomorrow night at the state theater .   he use to take me . 
he &apos;s about to . 
can we change the subject ? 
you were talking in your sleep . 
what are you thinking about ? 
he waved to you ? 
where &apos;s ripley &apos;s safe at ,  he keep his valuables in . 
a &apos;ight ,  this time we gotta get the motherfuckin &apos; trajectory right .  .  .   okay ,  on three :   one .  .  .  two .  .  . 
yeah ,  someone spotted two of  &apos;em in this hobo camp out by the airport ,  called the number -  - 
that bausch & lomb saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks . 
i think he must &apos;ve fell in . 
i found a rubber . 
 .  .  . the fuck is this .  .  . 
you good - lookin &apos; sumbitch .  .  . don &apos;t you ever die ! 
what is it with red ?   i &apos;ve never seen him this way . 
that was a nice little stunt you pulled ,  buzzing the base . 
what lizard ? 
shit ,  he &apos;s puking on my feet ! 
land of the free .  .  . 
didn &apos;t you say you told her not to come ? 
fun today .   like old times . 
what do you mean ?   i &apos;m just doing what we &apos;ve always done . 
that might not have been such a good idea .   they &apos;re making us fly out of a half - paved airfield .   the real punishment is that i won &apos;t be back to the barracks till it &apos;s too late for dinner or coffee .  so i guess it &apos;s goodbye for awhile . 
good luck over there mccawley .   i admire your decision . 
i heard what you did . 
what do you get for winning ? 
thank you ,   &apos;mam . 
hello ,  lieutenant .   good to see you .

it &apos;s all right .   danny always said i see things with my emotions instead of my eyes . 
what else can we do ? 
rafe  -  - 
it must of been a convincing letter . 
if ye &apos;d wanted a bloody cadillac ya should &apos;a stayed in the bloody states ! 
you have something to say ,  yamamoto ? 
what &apos;s peggy sue going to do at your lodge meeting ? 
i may be an old fool ,  but i think we can help you . 
but i want you and scott to understand .   do you think he loves janet ?  maybe he &apos;s smashed too many fortune cookies . 
i &apos;ll call you later . 
what happened ? 
come on peggy .  say what we rehearsed . 
i &apos;m still waiting for the mortgage check . 
you got a tab ? 
mmm .  this is nice .   i always loved the way you kiss .   i missed you . 
you know .  your love machine .  .  .  the throbbing thrill hammer .  .  .  your thing ! 
this is a mistake .  we better forget it . 
because nothing else matters .  that &apos;s the great thing about love .  every time we argue ,  every time something goes wrong ,  and i know that i &apos;m not perfect either ,  things just work out better in the end .  cause you &apos;re my baby and i love you . 
charlie .  i just had the strangest dream . 
i want to know what &apos;s going on .  dolores told me that you and that scuzzball michael fitzsimmons .  .  . 
but what has to be different ? 
what !  what about the group and my singing career ?  what about me ? 
stop being defensive .  i want to help you .  i wrote a song for you . 
not exactly ,  but with your great voice ,  it &apos;ll be a huge hit .  honest . 
don &apos;t be ridiculous !  they &apos;re just a bunch of harmless old men .  my grandfather was in there . 
let me got !  where are you taking me ? 
look .  i wanna tell you .  i forgive you for everything .  i know what you &apos;ve been going through .  you &apos;re just scared .  i was scared ,  too ,  but i &apos;m not anymore . 
come back to me . 
but happy .  very happy ,  peggy sue . 
hello ,  charlie . 
we think this party might cheer her up .  just make sure you know what &apos;s expected of you . 
are you for real ? 
maybe you &apos;re confusing his life with his work . 
why not ?  polygamy &apos;s legal in utah . 
young lady ,  you &apos;re drunk ! 
jack ,  take it easy .  she gave blood at school today .  maybe she &apos;s just a little lightheaded . 
i &apos;m excused . 
what happened to you ? 
isn &apos;t that awfully forward ? 
no ,  just a friend of mine .  i don &apos;t think he likes jello . 
you know mom ,  it &apos;s okay to have male friends .  besides ,  it &apos;s over with me and charlie . 
teenagers are weird .  and you &apos;re the weirdest . 
what &apos;s up ? 
that &apos;s my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito .  i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland . 
well ,  i think time is like a burrito .  sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other . 
you can till it with whatever you want .  from illusions to memory ,  from experience to innocence ,  from happiness to the entire universes
i &apos;d be very careful if i were you .  you don &apos; t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain . 
i &apos;m curious ,  but i don &apos;t want to know .  jeez ,  i hope you haven &apos;t been telling people what &apos;s going to happen to them . 
good .  you &apos;re discreet .  i like that in a partner . 
you don &apos;t have to use pig latin !  nobody could possibly know what we &apos;re talking about . 
the wave of the future !  i &apos;ve decided on our first fortune !  i &apos;ll see you later .  you just think high tech . 
jogging .  i was running ,  now i &apos;m jogging . 
hey !  do you have any idea how much those beakers cost ?  i usually charge for hypnosis . 
i came to say goodbye . 
 .  .  . the pathologist .  .  .  he said that you had reported a similar incident .  .  .  with a cat .  .  . 
you want some advice ,  friend ?  you get in your car ,  you pick up your family .  .  .  and you get the hell out of that town . 
believe what you saw ,  matthews .  the dog was dead . 
i hear you moved into town . 
i hear you &apos;ve got marjorie hargrove working for you now . 
what ? 
i &apos;m real excited about working for you mr .  matthews .  .  . 
i hope he doesn &apos;t have rabies . 
what ? 
i think so . 
damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him .  i swear that dog &apos;s an idiot . 
what &apos;s his name ? 
i gotta go back and do my chores .  .  . 
how did it go with your father last night ? 
yes ! 
allright .  calm down . 
thanks ,  walter . 
perhaps .  .  .  you &apos;re right .  i &apos;ve certainly been busy .  with the kronos complaint ,  a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time .  .  . 
drew ! 
you got that right ,  mikey .  .  .   you still believe that ,  don &apos;t you ? 
we &apos;re not skipping this treatment . 
i &apos;m not going to close the -  - 
maybe i should start making plans ,  is that what you think ?  start planning my memorial service ?   &quot; begin to prepare for the inevitable .  &quot; 
i &apos;m not going to die . 
whatever . 
i know that ,  charles . 
take it easy ,  walter . 
i hoped the challenge would improve your performance .  you could say it was a carrot . 
you can save it for the jury ,  charles .  i want to hear you say ,  under oath ,  in front of a judge and a jury ,  i &apos;m a bad lawyer .   gentlemen .   counselor . 
this is my partner .  we keep records of hospital visits .  nothing personal . 
whoa - oh !   sorry ,  i .  .  . 
my lover and i . 
there is no relevant precedent . 
one more thing ,  your honor .  .  . 
you think i &apos;m uncomfortable .  .  . 
i &apos;ve considered that . 
i know a good probate lawyer . 
what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean ? 
but you were< / u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 ? 
do you need a break ? 
you &apos;ve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with ,  correct ? 
no .  i can &apos;t really see it . 
where &apos;s dad ? 
apparently ,  mr .  wheeler felt they were too .  .  .   &quot; ethnic &quot;  is the word she used .  she said he would like it if i wore something smaller ,  less garish ,  and .  .  .  more  &quot; american .  &quot; 
objection ! 
objection ! 
we object ,  your honor .  it would unfairly influence the jury . 
it doesn &apos;t travel through the air ,  by breathing ,  or touching ,  right ? 
but ,  andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit . 
according to the deposition ,  you said you were  &quot; thrilled ,  impressed ,  overwhelmed &quot;  by the quality of andrew beckett &apos;s work .  do you remember saying that ? 
and i hate to rush you out of here ,  but .  .  . 
great . 
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  .  .  do you think .  .  .   ?  you think i &apos;m< / u> .  .  .    .  .  .  gay ? 
since when ? 
and the way they work out ,  pumping up ,  so they can be macho and faggot at the same time .  .  .  i can &apos;t stand< / u> that shit .  now i &apos;m being totally honest with you . 
whoa ,  whoa .  .  .   what do you expect them to say ,  you &apos;re alan dershowitz ? 
yeah .  but we took care of him . 
she< / u> didn &apos;t try to conceal it . 
i &apos;ve seen your television commercials .   &quot; if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others .  .  .  it should say ,   &quot; through the negligence< / u> of others .  &quot; 
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to ?   what is it ,  bob ?  ! 
i &apos;ve discovered something interesting ,  charles . 
audrey ?  oh ,  audrey .  .  .  . 
three full bottles .  but almost time to refill . 
what whispers ? 
power cells . 
strange ,  not doin &apos; a run - up on the main drive yet .   strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape . 
riddick .  .  . was thinkin &apos; we should make some kind of deal .  just in case ,  you know ,  this actually  -  - 
back to the ship ,  huh ? 
you barely know them . 
this is it ?  booze ?  that &apos;s< / u> what you have to drink ? 
i don &apos;t need his life story .  is he really that dangerous ? 
no ,  no ,  i wanted to get away . 
nobody else is going down but me ,  okay ? 
wait for what ?  until it &apos;s so dark we can &apos;t even find our way back to  -  - 
okay ,  maybe that &apos;s a good< / u> thing .  maybe i can use him to help with  -  - 
you have a little caffeine in the morning ,  i have a little morphine .  so what ? 
owens was already dead .  his brain just hadn &apos;t caught on to that fact . 
so you noticed too ? 
it &apos;s the atmosphere .  too much pressure ,  not enough oxygen .  might take a few days to  -  - 
imam .  we should leave soon .  before nightfall but while it &apos;s cooler . 
frightening thought . 
hasan ? 
oh ,  no .  no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  . 
we got you .  .  . it &apos;s okay ,  it &apos;s okay .  .  . we got you now .  .  .  . 
we crossed our own tracks . 
want you to remember this moment ,  riddick .  the way it coulda gone and didn &apos;t . 
what ,  you don &apos;t really think they left with their clothes on the lines ?  photos on the walls ? 
you were tryin &apos; to kill him too . 
oh .  ,  no .  ,  sir .  i was just assembling my notes . 
i apologize . 
no sir ,  i haven &apos;t forgotten . 
they can &apos;t convict us of that .  you proved our innocence .  besides .  .  .    .  .  .  his culture is our culture . 
the blood transfusion . 
now ,  just a minute  -  - 
how did it go ? 
nothing will grow here  .  .  .  .  there &apos;s just a trace of hydrocarbons ,  and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates . 
well ,  at least they haven &apos;t tried to bite us . 
which one was wearing the strange clothes ? 
will he live ? 
this place is dirty ,  doctor . 
yes ,  sir .  the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal ,  malicious mischief and scientific heresy . 
tell the court ,  bright eyes  -  -  what is the second article of faith ? 
get me a collar and leash .  i &apos;m taking him to the infirmary . 
apart from that ,  you look pretty chipper for a man who &apos;s two thousand and thirty one years old .   i read the clocks .  they bear out hasslein &apos;s hypothesis .  we &apos;ve been away from earth for two thousand years ,  give or take a decade .   still can &apos;t accept it ,  huh ? 
sorry ,  lucius .  you &apos;ll have to stay here and guard the horses . 
all right ,  all right .  will you do me a favor ?  no orders . 
they think you &apos;re behaving foolishly .  i must say i agree .  where will you go ? 
that &apos;s the boy .  keep  &apos;em flying . 
who put them up ? 
dr .  zira  -  -  tell bright eyes to sit down . 
how so ? 
no . 
if you are protecting others of your kind ,  it will cost you your identity . 
what is your proposal ? 
what evidence ?  no weapons were found in the cave . 
listen - 
actually ,  you &apos;re a different breed .  this creature will never evolve . 
you want her that much ? 
what &apos;s the diagnosis ,  doctor ?  a touch of the sun ? 
then tell them dr .  zaius won &apos;t leave here alive . 
how sad .  stuffed and mounted ,  eh ?  dead men ,  like sunken ships ,  can tell no stories .  and his other companion ?

and baaaaaaa !  back on you . 
tennessee someplace .  hill country .

nice room .  balcony and everything .  lovely view too . 
no thanks ? 
the brush - off ,  huh ? 
don &apos;t i even get my face slapped ? 
betty ,  this is margo west .  she wants to meet you .  miss mayfield . 
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing more tonight ,  miss .  unless you charter a plane . 
they might think i was running away from something . 
good morning .  can i do something for you ? 
merely for our records ,  miss mayfield .  it &apos;s usual for the guests who come here for the first time . 
brandon .  clark brandon .  fellow about my age .  lot of money .  .  .  that he didn &apos;t make .  former american .  now naturalized in canada .  social standing indeterminate .  manners not quite perfect .  scotch superb . 
no .  .  not very well .  and i like his friends even less .  but .  .   if you really want a good dry martini .  . 
and do you amuse the guests ? 
neatly said .  .  . but to the wrong man .  the trouble with pretty girls is that they can &apos;t imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls .  i get tired of it . 
dance ? 
want a spike in it ? 
he could hardly help suspecting you . 
that &apos;s the second round i &apos;ve lost tonight .   that fellow hurt me . 
funny ,  i never thought of you that way .   you were so close too .   we were all pretty stupid about you . 
so could you .   but our records were a little against us . 
it buys things ,  just like any other kind . 
you &apos;ll never make it .   you &apos;ve out -  smarted yourself . 
mine ? 
beer or ale ,  miss ? 
your family coat of arms ,  mr .  killaine ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
good morning ,  mr .  killaine .  i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t give you the name of my bank -  - because i have no bank at the moment .   that was a crude trick . 
care for a stroll outside ?  beautiful morning .  the air is like wine ,  the sky is a deep blue . 
but not in the investigation of a major crime ,  i hope . 
i &apos;ll find out ,  you know .  perhaps not today -  - perhaps not tomorrow .  but in the end ,  i &apos;ll find out . 
you won &apos;t tell me who you are ?  you won &apos;t even give me a chance to help you ? 
this isn &apos;t a very good place to talk . 
palm trees against a sunset -  - waves breaking on a coral reef -  - the taj mahal by moonlight -  - roses in an english garden ,  just after a shower -  -   clichs ,  one and all -  - but good ones ,  with a lot of mileage left in them -  - there &apos;s one thing he does not see -  - murder -  - and murder was what he was sent to find .   pretty ridiculous ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
and there &apos;s a mr .  goble to see you .  says his business is personal . 
i &apos;d like a few words with you ,  in private . 
i &apos;m still asking .  what do you want ? 
what have you got on miss mayfield ? 
that &apos;s a nice hard knee you &apos;ve got ,  goble .  how &apos;d you like to trade it for a broken neck ? 
there &apos;s two hundred .  i &apos;ll meet you in an hour -  - where we met last night
i &apos;m sorry .  this thing has just knocked me silly .   how long do we have to wait for this police character ? 
what &apos;s this in favor of ? 
it goes with this .  .  .  cold houses and warm drinks .  .  . the effete englishman . 
the usual grind . 
would it have helped if i &apos;d knocked him down ? 
how are you two getting along ? 
the only answer i have for you . 
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair . 
what are you doing here ? 
what do you want ? 
you nasty ,  sardonic -  - 
so he did -  - but he hasn &apos;t told you what he saw .  i have . 
one of these days ,  you &apos;re going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you &apos;ve cut your throat . 
i needn &apos;t keep you any longer ,  mr .  clarendon . 
we &apos;ve done that .   he &apos;s a san francisco private eye .   name martin j .  goble ,  g - o - b - l - e .   had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it .   goble and greer is the firm name . 
mr .  brandon couldn &apos;t be here .   he might have left something for you .  what would it look like ? 
you &apos;ve got a dead man on your hands .  you killed jim -  - even if it wasn &apos;t murder .   what are you going to do about it ? 
you can find out . 
and she did give him the chance ,  the way it worked out . 
you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .   we don &apos;t make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison . 
killaine ,  this is mr .  mitchell ,  senior .   young mitchell &apos;s father .  he just flew in from toronto . 
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield ? 
it won &apos;t look pretty good on your record ,  killaine .   where &apos;s the girl now ? 
this girl is a murderess ,  killaine . 
ye have ,  have ye ? 
you &apos;re a young man .   you &apos;re romantic .   you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together .  you think a soft voice means a soft heart .   you &apos;ll grow out of that . 
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared .  i wasn &apos;t lucky . 
i told you she &apos;s just .  . 
i &apos;m sorry .  i forgot about calling for you . 
be nasty . 
i see .   are you a socialist ,  mr .  penfield ? 
to ann . 
the references are to hansard or to newspapers .   i haven &apos;t got the actual speeches now .   you &apos;ll have to chase them up . 
now first of all ,  tell us your name . 
working hard on that book i was telling you about .   coming to the meeting ? 
no .   that &apos;s terrible ,  charles .  what happened ? 
i &apos;ll have some of that . 
and you &apos;ll join me in a sambucca ? 
can i give you a lift ? 
mummy and i ,  we were more like lovers ,  really ,  or sisters .   then a couple of years after daddy died ,  and not long after i left oxford ,  she started seeing various men and i was furious .   i really was upset .  i stopped going home .   i never phoned .   i went round telling everyone how awful her books were .  and she hardly seemed to notice ,  and that made me angrier .   then i got a job i was interested in ,  and i started to see lots of men ,  and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand .   so i wrote her a long letter ,  almost seven pages ,  saying how sorry i was ,  and how i was worried that we were drifting apart .   and do you know ,  she wrote me a poem ,  a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters . 
damn .   they &apos;re early . 
i haven &apos;t seen much of you . 
to the airlift . 
c &apos;mon .   i don &apos;t want any jones about this . 
bastard . 
according to this ,  the daughter goes up to stay quiet often .   you &apos;ll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend . 
that &apos;s enough of that . 
delivering gossip and goodwill .  it seems we &apos;ll both be doing brighton .   perhaps you should come too . 
and you were obviously getting nowhere with her .   i was waiting for the right moment to tell you that . 
jeremy !   how fantastic . 
it was last year . 
what &apos;s their program ? 
i gotta be fucking crazy . 
football &apos;s a man - made game .   you keep score with numbers .   but in this ,  there &apos;s no field ,  no rules ,  no opponent .   just you and the wave . 
ever done this before ? 
it &apos;s a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer .   one last speedstar . 
one thousand feet .   pull the goddamn cord ! 
talk . 
we &apos;re wasting time . 
i can &apos;t do this . 
where &apos;s roach ? 
well is there anyone else here that might have seen him ? 
this is us .   bank robbery .   and you &apos;re in the bank - robbery capital of the world -  - 
you &apos;re a real blue - flame special ,  aren &apos;t you ,  utah ?   i don &apos;t know why they sent you to la .   must be an asshole shortage .

they found the drop car up on mulholland .   i want you two to go work it . 
look ,  harp .   don &apos;t turn him over to the uniforms like some punk .   let me ride him in . 
smart .   you burn time in the vault . 
you through ,  mr .  wizard ?   let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you &apos;re at it .   hell ,  it &apos;s only 7 : 30 .   the night &apos;s still young .  .  .  you can solve this case and start on another one . 
candle wax .   car wax .   mustache wax ?  could be anything .   guy &apos;s waxing his mustache at the beach .   gets sand in it .   wipes it off with a shoe .   shoe scuffs the counter . 
big zippo so far .   how about you ? 
this gonna take long ? 
meaning you were expendable . 
jesus christ ,  johnny  -  -  you &apos;ve been using me !   your jacket &apos;s on the floor in the bathroom  -  -  this goddamn thing &apos;s half out of the pocket .  .  .  oh god ,  it &apos;s all part of some case ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
i work bank robbery .   guys i &apos;m after are surfers .   i needed you ,  at first ,  but not -  - 
well ,  i saw you and -  - 
strange ,  major .  there was a firefight .  shooting in all directions . 
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something .  blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat .  beautiful . 
our rendezvous points and radio freqs .  are indicated and fixed .  awacs contact on four hour intervals . 
you &apos;re wastin &apos; your time . 
what are you talking about ?  we &apos;ll be out of here in ten minutes . 
take a position over there .  i &apos;ll work around towards you .  when i flush him ,  you nail him .  .  . 
any sign of the hostages ? 
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back .  we &apos;ll bury him in the morning . 
that &apos;s over the border ,  general . 
you lift off in three hours .   there &apos;s one other thing . 
how could anyone get through this ,  carry blain out ,  right under our noses without leavin &apos; a trace ? 
it &apos;s .  .  .  it &apos;s not like that . 
the real estate possibilities are endless .   most of the yard we &apos;ll just level .   i talked to a couple of developers ,  under the table ,  of course ,  and they said  -  - 
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal . 
hey sugar ,  you lookin &apos; for a date ? 
why don &apos;t you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ? 
nice car .   yours ? 
you like being a hooker ,  vivian ? 
so do day jobs . 
very good .   you ought to have that printed up on your business card . 
no ,  but it &apos;s getting there . 
what &apos;s your name ,  lover . 
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks . 
no ?   why &apos;s that ? 
the one i &apos;m buying this week will cost around 150 million . 
vivian  -  - 
assets are anything of value a company owns .   sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole .   by selling them off ,  i make a profit . 
where &apos;d you learn to do this ? 
what about dinner ? 
what id we run into someone i know ? 
edward ,  these women here ,  i don &apos;t think any of &apos;m like the guys they &apos;re with .   they &apos;re just into it for the money . 
i thought i was the pro .   these women make me feel like an amateur . 
i &apos;ve been with stinking old men who &apos;ve made me want to puke but i &apos;ve never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight . 
what was i supposed to do ?   i told the truth .   why should the truth upset you ?   it &apos;s not as if you &apos;re from a convent . 
vivian .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry .   i wasn &apos;t prepared for questions about us .  it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did .   i should have known that it would hurt you . 
what if someone tries to steal it ? 
to meet some friends .   rudolpho ,  a poet .  .  .  benoit ,  a landlord .  .  .  mimi ,  a flower maker .  .  . 
you mean ,  besides elvis ?   i &apos;m a human being .   sure .   once .  first time i ever ran away from home ,  i got as far as atlanta .  i met this boy .   he &apos;d been with his parents on their way to chicago .   they stopped at a gas station .   he went to the john .  when he came back they &apos;d split .  we sorta started looking out for each other .   aw ,  he was sweet .  and boy ,  was he good looking ,  y &apos;know ,  dark hair and eyes .  the chicken hawks were on him all the time .   he hated that .  sometimes we &apos;d find a safe place to crash nights and we &apos;d curl up together and we &apos;d talk about all these crazy things .   the two of us getting married someday .  having kids .   stupid stuff . 
if it &apos;s in italian ,  how will i know what they &apos;re saying ? 
if you &apos;d gone on about how much you liked it ,  i &apos;m not sure i &apos;d have believed you . 
what else ?   you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town ? 
vivian ,  life &apos;s not a fairy tale .

i &apos;m going to spend money< / u> . 
you don &apos;t believe me ? 
he is a sailor on the pirate ship  &quot; revenge .  &quot;  promise to return him to his ship . 
every ship but the four you sent . 
and what is that worth ,  the promise of a woman ?  you &apos;re very funny ,  highness . 
oh ,  westley ,  darling .   westley ,  why won &apos;t you hold me ? 
what ? 
i did that on purpose .  i don &apos;t have to miss . 
you were supposed to be this colossus .  you were this great ,  legendary thing .  and yet he gains . 
oh ,  you &apos;ve a great gift for rhyme . 
i don &apos;t think more than ten . 
inigo  -  -  there &apos;s more than thirty  -  - 
will this do ? 
don &apos;t pester him ,  he &apos;s had a hard day . 
inigo . 
he &apos;s getting away from me ,  fezzik .  please .  fezzik ! 
i brought you a special present . 
it was a very emotional time for buttercup  -  - 
westley didn &apos;t reach his destination .  his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts ,  who never left captives alive .  when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered  -  - 
they &apos;re kissing again ,  do we have to hear the kissing part ? 
skip on to the fire swamp  -  -  that sounded good . 
i &apos;m telling you you &apos;re messing up the story ,  now get it right ! 
yes . 
who kills prince humperdinck ?  at the end ,  somebody &apos;s got to do it .  is it inigo ?  who ? 
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow . 
form a brute squad then .  i want the thieves &apos; forest emptied before i wed . 
i could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off .   you returned this westley to his ship ? 
who are you ?   -  -  are we enemies ?  why am i on this wall ?   -  -  where &apos;s buttercup ?   -  - 
and it is guarded by sixty men . 
why ?  you can &apos;t even lift one . 
 -  -  yes  -  - 
 -  -  anything you want  -  - 
thank you for everything . 
you &apos;re amazing ! 
but if there can be no arrangement ,  then we are at an impasse . 
you &apos;re that smart ? 
a life expiring and you don &apos;t have the decency to say why you won &apos;t help  -  - 
bye - bye ,  boys . 
you are sick ,  that &apos;s why he &apos;s here . 
yes .   dopey show - girls in gooey gowns .   two - three - kick - turn !   turn -  turn - kick - turn !   it &apos;s enough to make you throw up !   at last a chance to do straight drama !   to deal with conflict ,  with inner truth .   roger de bris presents history .   of course ,  i think we should add a little music .   that whole third act has got to go .  they &apos;re losing the war .   it &apos;s too depressing .   we &apos;ll have to put something in there .   aaahghhh !   i see it !   a line of beautiful girls ,  dressed as storm troopers ,  black patent leather boots ,  all marching together .  .  .  two - three - kick - turn !   turn - turn -  kick - turn ! 
 &quot; by the light ,  by the light , 
yes sir . 
but that &apos;s cheating ! 
thank you ,  bloom .   i knew i could con you . 
what was i saying ? 
yes ,  it &apos;s quite possible . 
so what ?   what did it get me ?   i &apos;m wearing a cardboard belt . 
what scheme ? 
mr .  bialystock .   no .   wait .   please .  you &apos;re holding me too tight .   i &apos;m an honest man .   you don &apos;t understand . 
good .   good .   that &apos;s nice .   that &apos;s very nice .   i think i &apos;m coming out of it now .   yes .   yes .   i &apos;m definitely coming out of it .   thank you for smiling .   it helped a great deal . 
i got it ,  mr .  bialystock . 
where would you like to eat ? 
nonsense !   as far as whitehall and marks are concerned ,  you &apos;re working with bialystock ,  right ? 
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s happening .  we &apos;ve struck gold .   not fool &apos;s gold ,  but real gold .   the mother lode .   the mother lode .   the mother of them all . 
there it is .  .  .  in red and white !   &quot; springtime for hitler ,  &quot;  signed ,  sealed and delivered .   what &apos;s the matter with you ? 
how do you do .   have you gone mad ?   a receptionist that can &apos;t speak english .   what will people say ? 
but if something should .  .  .  god forbid .  .  .  go wrong ,  at least we could give them some of their money back .   it would look better in court . 
so much for nutsy fagin . 
maybe it &apos;s not true ! 
i never should have listened to you . 
here .   buy bullets .   kill .   kill them all ! 
well ,  i .  .  .  well ,  it &apos;s just that .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry i called you fat ,  fat ,  fat . 
finder &apos;s keepers . 
wait .   wait .   we can &apos;t play today .  i have too many appointments . 
rudolfo ,  you dirty pig !   pull over . 
like clockwork . 
of course ,  the check ,  i had it with me all the time . 
smasheroo .   smasheroo . 
i solemnly swear .  .  . 
nietzche .  .  . 
and last ,  but not least ,  adolph .  .  .  you know who . 
no ,  not at all sir ,  we &apos;re quite serious .   we want to produce your play .   i have the contracts right here . 
mr .  liebkind ,  mr .  liebkind . 
people can hear you . 
i didn &apos;t think the police went searching for people who weren &apos;t in trouble . 
now there &apos;s a couple even remarking about your sign ,  and see how easily you forgot them ? 
no . 
what ? 
of course not . 
let &apos;s all talk about mary . 
did you check in phoenix .  .  .  hospitals .  .  .  maybe she had an accident .  .  .  a hold - up .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know . 
casharoonie ! 
with a little checking ,  i could get to believe you . 
sick of the sight of it !   well ,  suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i &apos;ll have my mechanic give yours the once over and .  .  .  want some coffee ?  i was just about .  .  . 
you mean you don &apos;t want the usual day and a half to think it over ?   you are in a hurry !  somebody chasin &apos; you ? 
i &apos;ll be perfectly honest with you ,  ma &apos;am .  it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t trust you ,  but .  .  . 
isn &apos;t mr .  lowery back from lunch ? 
you better run out to the house .  she may be .  .  .  unable to answer the phone .  .  . 
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday .  and no trace until .  .  . 
he didn &apos;t mention the money .   what he said on the phone isn &apos;t important ,  is it ?   he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother ,  and he didn &apos;t !  that &apos;s what i want you to do something about ! 
i still feel .  .  . 
what thing could we be in together ? 
hundreds !  which one is your pet ? 
i feel better when you feel better . 
got the number of the motel out on the old highway ?  bates ,  i think .  
huh ? 
we should have asked for cabin one .  .  .  the one mary was in . 
sorry . 
call your boss and tell him you &apos;re taking the rest of the afternoon off .  it &apos;s friday anyway .  .  .  and hot . 
and besides ,  when you say i make tax -  deductible excuses you make me out a criminal . 
i can come down next week . 
yeah ,  but when you do .  .  .  you &apos;ll swing . 
dirty night . 
stuffy in here .   well .  .  .  the mattress is soft and there &apos;re hangers in the closet and .  .  .  stationary with  &quot; bates &apos; motel &quot;  printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious .  .  .  and .  .  .  the .  .  .  over there .  .  .  .  
you should .  .  .  mind it . 
except you . 
i &apos;ve suggested it myself .  but i hate to even think such a thing .   she needs me .  .  .  and it isn &apos;t .  .  .    .  .  . it isn &apos;t as if she were a maniac ,  a raving thing .  .  .  it &apos;s just that .  .  .  sometimes she goes a little mad .  we all go a little mad sometimes .  haven &apos;t you ? 
thank you ,  norman . 
no ,  m &apos;am . 
is there ? 
we have a problem . 
just coming up to ring for you . 
my mother is not dead ! 
buy a new one !  in a new town !  where you won &apos;t have to hide your mother ! 
you didn &apos;t find anything . 
just before she died she came to -  - 
then you knew of the inheritance ? 
i know i am .  why ,  i even heard a shot up there last night . 
 &#93 lot of] how many cats you have -  - what &apos;s the matter -  -  rats ? 
oh ,  him .  he has a cat of his own .  but his assistant -  - he &apos;s the cat - hatenest man i ever saw .  goofy ,  if ya ast me . ]
how do you do . 
you here again ? 
 &#93 something very important .  i have been threatened;] mrs .  maxwell ,  my assistant &apos;s wife ,  is crazy .   she thinks i mur -  dered her husband .   &#93 she wants to murder me . ] i want you to help me quiet her -  -  give her a shot from this hypo .   &#93 keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement -  -  there is a secret vault  &#93 there] .  we will put her there till we get your husband -  -  &#93 then turn her over to the authorities .  then we will both be free . ]
what is it ? 
what were you dreaming about ? 
the child ! 
the blood transfusion continues .  marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp ,  so that he can see nikolas in bright light ,  while he himself sits in the dark .  nikolas watches lone &apos;s face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death .  life slowly seems to return to her ,  and her breathing becomes more peaceful .  she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her ,  but she is much too enfeebled to speak ,  and closes her eyes again .  marc keeps a close watch on nikolas ,  who grows paler and paler .  his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again . 
i don &apos;t have any affairs .  what do you mean ? 
there &apos;s no hurry .  it &apos;s early . 
why didn &apos;t you eat last night ? 
you wouldn &apos;t get mixed up with that little rotter ,  would you ? 
i think so . 
why ,  certainly ,  sir .  my fiance .  charlotte ,  may i present mr .  igor . 
she thinks it &apos;s funny to talk the way she does ,  but -  - 
if you will forgive this poor ,  crippled stump ,  my dear ,  i am very happy to know you . 
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born .  before this terrible thing happened to me  .  .  .    .  .  .  i made a very beautiful statue .  even if i had not met with this disaster ,  i could never have hoped to do anything finer ,  probably nothing quite so fine .  and ,  my child ,  you are that figure come to life .  i wonder ,  some time ,  would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work ? 
we &apos;ll be coming to the opening . 
no  -  -  i  -  -  wanted to speak to ralph .  we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind . 
but it was really my fault . 
please ,  oh ,  please ,  i haven &apos;t done anything to hurt you . 
where did you get the news item ?   from a little bird ? 
i &apos;m through clowning .  you &apos;re all washed up .  get out ! 
you cannot .  i &apos;m still editor of this sheet . 
well ,  why so mysterious !  come on ,  spill it . 
no kiddin &apos; ? 
call the homicide squad ! 
don &apos;t they ?  he &apos;s down at the tombs right now . 
what do you mean police dog ? 
i told you he was a sore . 
fine ,  thanks . 
now look here .  it &apos;s not up to us to do our own detective work .  i &apos;ve had enough trouble over this matter .  i don &apos;t want anything more to do with it . 
 -  - and so determined to live that i &apos;m going to get out and take a taxi if you don &apos;t watch where you &apos;re going . 
oh ,  is that what caused it ? 
what is it ?  what happened ? 
you will have won the undying gratitude of us all .   is that not so ,  marie antoinette ? 
to lunch . 
but i have some friends waiting . 
i will only be gone about half an hour . 
have you got it ?  is it completed ? 
i &apos;d be glad to ,  mr .  igor .   i think i &apos;ll have somethin &apos; to tell you soon . 
i &apos;d know him anywhere . 
don &apos;t waste it pauly .   this is not an everyday talk .   just input the information and ask relevant questions .   one :  how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station ? 
two :  what if i didn &apos;t miss ? 
spare me your classical answer .  measurements in .   results taken .   what if i didn &apos;t miss ? 
i thought i &apos;d go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to .  as a child ,  i never had no room all to myself ,  we were awful poor .  buddy .  .  .  i have got a confession to make . 
aw ,  come on ,  rose ,  i want to see what the nipple on it is like . 
well ,  are you satisfied now ?  can we just lie and talk ,  huh ? 
all right ,  that &apos;s enough .   you &apos;re just a child and wouldn &apos;t understand it ,  but that type of thing can stir a girl up .  now lie back and we &apos;ll talk . 
you know ,  buddy ,  sometimes i can &apos;t figure you out at all .  you can be very nice ,  but like your mother said there &apos;s an evil streak in you . 
you better quit that . 
well ,  ill tell you this .  i have learned a lesson tonight .  i wasn &apos;t gonna run around ,  but when i start botherin &apos; your daddy and worse robbin &apos; a cradle ,  i gotta face the facts of life .   tomorrow mornin &apos; ,  i &apos;m gonna get myself up and go out . 
you don &apos;t know the bedside manner that man has got .  why ,  it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin &apos; in his bag like he &apos;s gonna cure me ,  which he did of course .  and even more important he loves me ,  like a patient i mean ,  the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin &apos; to my heart beat . 
yeah ,  he tried to hide it but i saw  &apos;em ,  and a little bit he says to me ,   &quot; you know ,  you are beautiful .  &quot;  now wasn &apos;t that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient ,  wasn &apos;t it ?  what could cheer a girl up more ? 
hi ,  buddy .   how &apos;s my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad ? 
did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits ? 
yep ,  we had  &apos;em in orange crates all over .  it was daddy &apos;s dream .  he was goin &apos; to get rich raisin &apos; rabbits .  it was what killed daddy .  he didn &apos;t drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid ,  but it was them rabbits what killed him . 
he thought he could sell  &apos;em ,  but nobody but country folks eat rabbits ,  buddy ,  and they ain &apos;t got no money .  we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves .  every dern one ,  and it took about four years to eat  &apos;em all up . 
you were up late last night ,  brother . 
i heard you talking .  hasn &apos;t rose come in ? 
i said ahhh - dam stuff . 
what &apos;d you say ,  brother ? 
yeah . 
this is my place and you can &apos;t have it . 
buddy ,  this is amazing ,  you wouldn &apos;t believe it . 
he kissed her . 
she &apos;s putting the titty back . 
it isn &apos;t that she hasn &apos;t got any sense ,  doll .  her basic intelligence is probably above average ,  maybe quite a bit above average . 
buddy .  .  .  does rose really .  .  .   &quot; do it &quot;  with all those boys and men ? 
how could that be ,  son ? 
what sad news ?  did her cancer come back ? 
all right ,  daddy .  we have our drink ,  we &apos;re out on the patio ,  you have prepared me for it .  rose &apos;s cancer has come back ,  hasn &apos;t it ? 
but .  .  .  but how ?  she was young !  rose wasn &apos;t old ! 
that &apos;s a hell of a thing to say .  why ,  rose ? 
go ahead ,  doctor ,  i think i am following you . 
of course . 
it isn &apos;t the fourth dimension .  to you it &apos;s the fourth dimension ,  maybe ,  to me it &apos;s simply the truth . 
um - hmm .  well ,  that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life .  you walk down the street like that and they &apos;ll put you in jail ,  rose . 
well ,  i admit that outfit isn &apos;t very modest .  but she doesn &apos;t mean any harm ,  she just wants to attract ,  attention . 
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children . 
boys ?  you say to me boys ? 
excuse me ,  sir ,  are you calling my wife a liar ? 
honey ,  dr .  martinson isn &apos;t a rascal ,  he &apos;s one of the finest physicians in glenville .  he studied at johns hopkins university . 
she hasn &apos;t actually done anything .  .  . 
her plan is obvious ,  plain as day .  she &apos;s going on a hunger strike .  the question is ,  how do we foil her ? 
ah ,  ha !  hold the phone !  no forwarding address ,  huh ?   in the shock of this brilliant move ,  i forgot something . 
it &apos;s twenty after one . 
why ,  that looks like dave wilkie , 
all right ,  all right .  now calm down ,  rose ,  the children will hear you .  calm down ,  let &apos;s talk .  .  .  about this thing ,  let &apos;s discuss it . 
rose ,  what are you doing up ? 
you &apos;re so sweet . 
you don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going ? 
well ,  rose ,  my sleep was a little disturbed last night ,  and so was mrs .  hillyer &apos;s ,  and so was the children &apos;s .  how about you ?  was your sleep disturbed ,  too ? 
i got an awful bad cold . 
well ,  it was a silly question . 
mr .  hillyer ,  i know it was bad and i hadn &apos;t ought to of done it .  but i &apos;m only a human girl and i .  .  .  i ain &apos;t always perfect .  i promise i won &apos;t let him in the house no more ,  i promise .  won &apos;t you and mrs .  hillyer forgive me ? 
well ,  rose ,  going out to look for a job today ? 
your baby ? 
yes ,  i am . 
afraid of the hospital ? 
we make our own lives ,  madam .  as for malignancy ,  i don &apos;t think so ,  it &apos;s very unlikely .  i probably shouldn &apos;t have even mentioned that possibility to her . 
what are you talking about ?  i don &apos;t understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces . 
when he was baby we called him  &quot; wa wa ,  &quot;  a baby name ,  you know .  you will find him a very good boy .  his brother can be bad and so can his sister ,  but waski is a very good boy .  and as you can see he &apos;s beautiful . 
oh ,  no ,  ma &apos;am . 
it must be wonderful to be so smart .  i don &apos;t see how you do it ,  reading all those books ,  learning all that stuff . 
rose ,  you &apos;re in an awful dither tonight .  what &apos;s the matter with you ,  honey ,  are you sick or something ? 
well ,  i think it &apos;s charming ,  rose .   but don &apos;t you think .  .  .  ah ,  the skirt is a little tight ? 
rose ,  that scruffy - looking man is out in the yard again . 
rose has learned her lesson ,  haven &apos;t you ,  rose ? 
you look very pretty in it ,  rose .  really ,  you do . 
come on ,  don &apos;t you screw with her ,  please !   you .  .  .  you got to want this :  armored car job .   caltrust bank .  they took two million in cash .  .  . 
we &apos;ll take the caltrust heist ,  but if it &apos;s no good ,  we will hunt you down ,  and billy - boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it . 
well ,  i &apos;m running out of trees ,  so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don &apos;t know !   convince me ! 
it &apos;s bone dry out there .   everybody &apos;s hurting .   the stuff floating around &apos;s been cut so many times it &apos;s like powdered sugar ,  but zimnermann &apos;s gonna fix it . 
how &apos;s your precious little school - marm today ? 
nothing ,  i guess .   just an observation .   she &apos;s really something special .   you &apos;re a lucky fella . 
i say ,  fuck  &apos;em .   let &apos;s go . 
we shoulda been there to back you up .  we shoulda ! 
the booze . 
happy independence day . 
you know ,  the more weight back there ,  the faster the car goes . 
don &apos;t talk like that .   there &apos;s plenty of women around for jerks like you . 
what about jack daniels ?   wasn &apos;t he a decorated general in the civil war ? 
hey now ,  look !   let &apos;s all get on the same page here .   this shipment is do or die for zimmermann &apos;s syndicate; all or nothing .   if we stop the drugs ,  we don &apos;t even have to catch him red - handed .   he &apos;s ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell .   on the other hand ,  if we fuck this up ,  it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn &apos;t have a single empty drawer .   more old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk - hungry needle - freaks ,  and all the while zimmermann &apos;s sitting back and laughing his head off . 
well .  .  .  seeing how you just suspended me ,  what &apos;s to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard ,  you old fart ? 
you fuckers .  .  .  damn you !   why ?  !   why me !  ?   why the obsession with me ? 
pardon me .  .  .  my mistake .   taking your thoughts in hand ,  huh .  .  .   ? 
why do you bother with that mumbo - jumbo crap ?   some fruitcake &apos;s writing it between bong hits ,  making it up as he goes ,  and you &apos;re actually taking the time to read it . 
i just think you should show some respect .   i mean ,  call me old fashioned ,  but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence ,  they did that so we could all share in the freedom .  .  . 
can &apos;t be worse than you . 
that &apos;s right ,  white bread .   give it up .   right now . 
what .  .  .   ?   not you too ? 
this much powder you don &apos;t throw in the trunk with a blanket over it .  it &apos;s got to be smuggled . 
you see that ? 
hmm .  to protect you both from the emperor ,  you were hidden from your father when you were born .  the emperor knew ,  as i did ,  if anakin were to have any offspring ,  they would be a threat to him .  that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous . 
why don &apos;t you leave that crate and come with us ? 
i thought she was with you . 
take the squad ahead .   we &apos;ll meet at the shield generator at 0300 . 
shall we try and go around ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
the main entrance to the control bunker &apos;s on the far side of that landing platform .  this isn &apos;t gonna be easy . 
i &apos;m sure luke wasn &apos;t on that thing when it blew . 
yes . 
chewie !  chewie ,  give me the gun .  don &apos;t move ,  lando . 
look .  i want you to take her .  i mean it .  take her .  you need all the help you can get .  she &apos;s the fastest ship in the fleet . 
in his belly ,  you will find a new definition of pain and suffering ,  as you are slowly digested over a thousand years . 
what &apos;s he saying ? 
oh !  oh ,  my .  uh ,  princess leia ! 
come with me . 
i was telling the truth . 
he might be .   i don &apos;t know . 
janet . 
oh ,  brad .   let &apos;s go back .   i &apos;m cold and i &apos;m frightened . 
yes ,  the rain has been very heavy . 
oh .  .  .  . say something . 
well i want to leave . 
then ask the butler  -  or someone . 
oh brad  -  mmmm  -  oh yes ,  my darling  -  what if .  .  . 
good god . 
well .     i don &apos;t like men with .  .  . er ,  with too many ,  muscles . 
dealing
oh ,  no no ,  no no . 
no no no no . 
the master is not yet married .   nor do i think he ever will be .   we are simply his servants . 
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister ,  soon we will return to the moon - drenched shores of our  &quot; androgenous &quot;  planet . 
but you never had a chance to prove yourself . 
what &apos;s funny ? 
 .  .  . guess . 
here &apos;s the guys i was tellin &apos; ya about  -  -  this is cuff an &apos; link . 
why ? 
y &apos;know how i said that stuff on television didn &apos;t bother me ?

rocky ,  do you realize everybody in this country knows your face ,  and after the fight everybody in the world is going to . 
 .  .  . i can &apos;t beat him . 
no .  .  .  i can &apos;t ! 
einstein flunked out of school .  .  .  twice . 
too old ,  dull fighter .   bobby judge is a good boy . 
no doctor ! 
yo &apos; bleedin &apos; inside ,  man  -  -  get that doctor . 
don &apos;t kill yourself ,  man  -  -  let the doctor stop the fight .

nope .   it &apos;s that cloverleaf outfit again . 
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective .   what were you looking for ,  mr .  valiant ? 
well ,  why not ?   i &apos;m feeling magnanimous tonight .   the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist .  i &apos;m retiring to take a new role in the private sector . 
don &apos;t you think anyone &apos;s gonna notice that toontown &apos;s gone ? 
you ? 
no ?   i guess we &apos;re not counting lying ,  stealing and murder . 
yeah ,  i &apos;ll bet you would .   you gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work . 
tell me you didn &apos;t do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit . 
what &apos;s with the dip ? 
maybe .   why ? 
well ,  everybody needs a hobby . 
look ,  pal ,  if you &apos;re still here when i finish this drink ,  i &apos;m callin &apos; the police . 
yeah .   i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind ,  your wife the sound body . 
the habeus corpus is thickening . 
well .  .  .  i still don &apos;t think he &apos;d turn me in . 
a laugh can be a powerful thing ,  eddie .  sometimes it &apos;s the only weapon we have in life . 
so what &apos;s our plan ,  our scenario ,  our modus operandi ? 
gee ,  i didn &apos;t recognize you .  .  .  i &apos;ve never seen you laugh before .   that your brother makin &apos; the rabbit ears ? 
yeah ,  a toon .   it was the guy who killed bambi &apos;s mother . 
yeah ,  everybody thought so .   but me and teddy got a kick out of toons .   all toons .   we couldn &apos;t see the bad in  &apos;em .  and when this guy was accused of knockin &apos; over the first national bank of toontown ,  we took his case .   but when we looked into it ,  we found out he did do it after all .   we went to his house to take him in .   but he was wise .  he got the drop on us .  .  .  literally . 
i tell you what ,  maybe i better come with you . 
you know ,  eddie ,  i &apos;m not as much of a chump ,  and a patsy ,  a yokel as you think . 
what the hell are you doin &apos; in there ? 
i think you oughta read it to her . 
quarrel sir !  no ,  sir . 
live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow . 
where the devil should this romeo be ?  came he not home to - night ? 
why then ,  o brawling love ,  o loving hate ,  o anything of nothing first create .  heavy lightness .  serious vanity .  misshapen chaos of well seeming forms . 
alas ,  that love ,  whose view is muffled still ,  should ,  without eyes ,  see pathways to his will !  where shall we dine ?  o me !  what fray was here ?  yet tell me not ,  for i have heard it all .  here &apos;s much to do with hate ,  but more with love .  why ,  then ,  o brawling love !  o loving hate !  o any thing ,  of nothing first create !  o heavy lightness !  serious vanity !  misshapen chaos of well - seeming forms !  feather of lead -  -   &#93 benvolio snickers] dost thou not laugh ? 
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ? 
this wind ,  you talk of ,  blows us from ourselves; supper is done ,  and we shall come too late . 
forbear this outrage ,  good mercutio . 
 &apos;tis he . 
uncle ,   &apos;tis a shame . 
it strains me past the compass of my wits . 
i do spy a kind of hope ,  which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent .  if ,  rather than to marry paris ,  thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself ,  then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death ,  to chide away this shame .  no warmth ,  no breath shall testify thou livest  .  each part ,  deprived of supple government ,  shall stiff and stark and cold appear ,  like death .  now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed ,  there art thou dead .  thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie .  in the meantime ,  against thou shalt awake ,  shall romeo by my letters know our drift ,  and hither shall he come .  and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua .  take thou this vial ,  being then in bed ,  and this distilling liquor drink thou off .  i &apos;ll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua . 
where is my lady &apos;s lord ? 
geth thee to be and rest ,  for thou has need . 
 &#93 within] juliet ! 
i would thou hadst my bones ,  and i thy news :  i pray thee ,  speak . 
faith ,  here it is .  i think it best you marry with this paris .  o ,  he &apos;s a lovely gentleman .  i think you are happy in this second match ,  for it excels your first; or if it did not ,  your first is dead -  - or  &apos;twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him . 
what ? 
if they do see thee ,  they will murder thee . 
do not swear :  although i joy in thee ,  i have no joy of this contract to - night :  it is too rash ,  too unadvised ,  too sudden; too like the lightning ,  which doth cease to be ere one can say  &apos;it lightens .  &apos; sweet ,  good night !  this bud of love ,  by summer &apos;s ripening breath ,  may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .  good night . 
what satisfaction canst thou have to - night ? 
it is ,  it is !  hie hence ,  be gone ,  away .   o ,  now be gone .  more light and light it grows . 
by my count ,  i was your mother much upon these years ,  you are now a maid .  thus then in brief :  the valiant paris seeks you for his love . 
go !  we follow thee .  juliet ,  blah ! 
i will follow you . 
ay ,  ay ,  a scratch ,  a scratch .  ay ,  a scratch ,  a scratch .  ha ha ha . 
a plague o &apos; both your houses . 
only the stupid ones .   cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets .   besides ,  i &apos;m not ira no more . 
it &apos;s good to see you &apos;ve all got such faith in our little undertaking . 
and you believed me ?   but it wasn &apos;t my people who did it . 
not to me ,  you know that . 
you better be careful ,  seamus ,  before something happens a plastic surgeon can &apos;t fix . 
you &apos;re thinking with your gun ,  seamus ,  and not your head .  .  . 
sam .   i &apos;m a weapons guy . 
hazard pay .  .  . 
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it :  no credit cards ,  no bank accounts are in place :  ten percent up front ,  the rest when the job is done .   you .   what do you do and what should we call you ? 
it &apos;s quite satifactory . 
go ahead ,  shoot .  .  .  shoot and kill the bitch ,  i don &apos;t care .   and yet you don &apos;t shoot .   interesting .  put down your weapon and walk away . 
do you have the material ? 
whoever hired us . 
bullshit ! 
gregor ,  is that you ? 
how so ? 
it gets done now or not at all .   another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i can &apos;t get them . 
he sees this differently ,  as you well know . 
you suffered through an agonizing pain last night ,  pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law . 
all in the stomach ,  though .   your man might live . 
you should watch what you eat . 
i &apos;m just worried about your health ,  larry .   you could stand to shed a few pounds . 
is that right ? 
cigarette ? 
what &apos;s the difference ? 
deirdre ?   smart ,  yeah ,  and seriously goddamned dangerous . 
you were once some kind of special forces .   airborne ranger ,  maybe a navy seal .   after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan ,  a real mercenary .   only now  -  -  now you &apos;re like the rest of us ,  it &apos;s a very competitive market since the end of the cold war .   there &apos;s a lot of hired guns out here ,  and not nearly enough work to go around . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
i hope you don &apos;t mind i took your pack .  it was on the table . 
you don &apos;t .   you just learn to live with it . 
he &apos;s going back . 
you see it your way ,  i &apos;ll see it mine .  you need a doctor . 
and what job is that ? 
you know him ? 
i never made that claim . 
how could you have done that ? 
gimme a goddamn cigarette !  !  !  ! 
time to quit . 
 &quot; your field dressing saved his life .  &quot;  that &apos;s three i owe you .

why &apos;s that ? 
you put everything on the line because you .  .  . 
how old is otis anyhow ,  thirty ? 
oh ,  you would have done great . 
call it in i guess .   why ? 
no .   we can &apos;t .

i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out  -  - 
you &apos;re thinking about killing him .  i can &apos;t do that .   no way .   i &apos;ve never killed a man .   never even shot at one . 
i could kill that no good son of a bitch ! 
he &apos;s probably made copies .   he &apos;s not going to give them up to us . 
well what are we supposed to do ? 
you &apos;re crazy . 
how long is it going to take ?  ! 
even if we have the tape ,  that wouldn &apos;t shut him up !

i understand your logic ,  booth ,  but i don &apos;t think .  .  . two thousand &apos;s going to raise any eyebrows ,  do you ? 
i don &apos;t like getting grilled by that dea bitch ,  i don &apos;t like taking that kind of heat ! 
you &apos;re only screwing yourselves over !   helllllp !   helllllp !   somebody !  !  ! 
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap ,  but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys .  the last we heard from him was two days ago . 
i have to go to the bank before it closes . 
ok . 
what happened to your cheek ?  sally oh i .  .  . nothing .  .  .

this party is for you and bob .   get your mind off the reporter .

you don &apos;t know who she was ,  annie  -  -

oh .

how goes it ? 
it &apos;s like charley vidal says  -  -  there &apos;s two kinds of slavery ,  wage slavery and domestic slavery .  the woman question ,  he calls it . 
are you sick ,  mama ? 
mama ,  can i put the candles  .  .  .

the junior shop stewards .  there &apos;s lots of ways we can help . 
ramn  -  -  listen my kids  .  .  .

did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off ? 
that &apos;s because he doesn &apos;t have one . 
that &apos;s him .   he &apos;s a lot prettier in person though . 
then why didn &apos;t you help the kid when you were there ? 
danny ,  it &apos;s really pains me to have to tell you this ,  but do you remember domingo ,  that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back ? 
turns out he &apos;s connected . 
we know what &apos;s going on . 
what &apos;s on the other end of this thing ?

just make sure you hit the floor when we come in .  it could get ugly in there . 
danny ,  listen up .   here &apos;s the deal  .  .  .  my wife &apos;s pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab .   they &apos;re getting a very special delivery a week from this friday . 
i just want to be straight on the details .   can i taste it ? 
jesus jimmy ,  you at the alpha team . 
sir ? 
a private ,  sir ? 
but ,  sir .  .  . i .  .  . i .  .  . 
that must be four thousand yards . 
did you see what he did ,  back there ?  he stepped right into the open ,  so i could get across . 
sorry ,  sir ,  fresh out of trucks ,  how  &apos;bout a  &apos;38 ford roadster ,  hard - top ,  red with black interior . 
upham ? 
there you go again ,  that &apos;s whining ,  that &apos;s not okay . 
captain ,  what about our deal ? 
no .   it comes and goes .   it stops when i look at it . 
how about .  .  .  ? 
what was the name of that kid at anzio ,  the one who got his face burned off ? 
she &apos;s the best poker player you ever saw .   my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt .   finally ,  my mother gave him an ultimatum ,  either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night .  he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down ,  she never lost .   she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands .   and he bluffs ?   he had sixteen levels of bullshit .   her eyes ,  the tone of her voice ,  her bets ,  her jokes ,  the way she sipped her coffee ,  she was a master .   she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game .  every saturday night ,  my father would lose two ,  three hundred bucks and she &apos;d win it all back and then some .  and i &apos;d stand there ,  glued to her shoulder ,  from the time i was five years old ,  watching every hand ,  every move ,  studying how she did it .   that &apos;s why i &apos;m such a good officer ,  i can look at a man &apos;s face and tell you exactly what he &apos;s holding ,  and if it &apos;s a shit hand ,  i know just what cards to deal him . 
don &apos;t let yourself get killed ,  if you do ,  they might make me give back the medal and then i won &apos;t be able to lip off to colonels anymore . 
sarge ,  see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable . 
reiben ,  how the hell do you know so much about lingerie ? 
strides through the chaos ,  avoiding the passing vehicles .   he sees his men and walks toward them .   reiben hurries up to miller ,  pleading . 
i should be on my way to caen ,  sir .  it &apos;s like beethoven ,  the guy &apos;s one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf .   go figure ,  i mean ,  who &apos;d he piss off ?   and here i am ,  the beethoven of ladies foundation garments ,  one step away from caen ,  the center of the known lingerie universe and instead ,  i &apos;m going to ramelle to save some fucking private who &apos;s probably already dead . 
sir ,  you know what ramelle is famous for ?   cheese .   the rest of the company is going to caen and we &apos;re going to the goddamned cheese capital of france .   there is no bright side . 
jesus christ ,  he &apos;s a natural ! 
sir ,  i &apos;ve got an idea ,  let &apos;s go around . 
scans the germans with his binoculars . 
leave him to me ,  captain ,  i &apos;ll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us . 
goddamn it ! 
private .   i &apos;m sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn &apos;t going to help . 
don &apos;t do that again . 
doesn &apos;t move .   he just stares at sarge &apos;s body . 
fires the eighty - eight . 
jackson was from west fork ,  tennessee ,  he was going to be a preacher ,  his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson . 
oh ,  christ ,  now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again . 
wade &apos;s right ,  it &apos;s some kind of scientific ,  magnetic thing ,  i can &apos;t explain it ,  but i &apos;ve seen it . 
who cares ? 
on guard ,  glancing back .   pissed off . 
demolition ,  right ? 
you think he really believed it ? 
what &apos;s the profile ?

did you sleep with her ? 
the world is full of guys .   be a man .   don &apos;t be a guy . 
i don &apos;t feel anything .

lloyd ,  why do you have to be like this ? 
i didn &apos;t think anyone would get it . 
ha ! 
tell me ,  is it bad news ? 
she &apos;s not the world &apos;s greatest flyer ,  let me tell you .   when she was eight years old ,  she .  .  . 
which they did .   let me finish .

lloyd ? 
it doesn &apos;t feel right to me .   i ,  i don &apos;t even have the right luggage yet . 
you &apos;re not listening to me . 
unbelievable .   this is a nightmare . 
dad ,  you and i have talked about this .   lloyd and i have talked about this .   believe me ,  this is well - covered territory . 
dad ,  in a million years ,  i would never give him a pen .   what &apos;s wrong with having some fun ?   i like him . 
if i pick it up ,  we &apos;ll only get back together . 
i swear to god .

she &apos;s amazing .   she &apos;s ninety - three ,  she &apos;s a writer ,  and i told her about you . 
you know how it &apos;ll come out and feel .  .  .  y &apos;know .  .  .  little more ,  little more .  .  .  yeah ,  yeah ,  that &apos;s right .   go round just at first ,  keep it in first ,  just feel it . 
little more gas .   ease it up .   hold on -  minor setback .   now you feel confident ,  right ? 
yeah . 
yeah you do . 
you told your dad ? 
then don &apos;t do it . 
okay . 
yeah ! 
no my brother ,  you have to go buy your own . 
the guy with the datsun ? 
okay ,  i &apos;ll give here the message . 
my car . 
lloyd . 
don &apos;t make this like a counsel ,  lloyd .  i got statistics i can show you ,  i got graphs i can show you .   that &apos;s all the stuff i can show you ,  it all says the same thing .   you have to decide on a career . 
oh boy . 
mike cameron ,  how you doing ? 
what &apos;s your name ? 
what ? 
he looks great ,  though ,  doesn &apos;t he ?  i have to know  -  where do you get a suit like that ?   what is that ,  silk ?   it &apos;s great . 
you held back stern .   you held back the one man most important to my business . 
you took my workers . 
when ? 
you want these people . 
what are you ,  moses ?   what is this ?  where &apos;s the money in this ?   what &apos;s the scam ? 
you &apos;re not telling me something . 
yeah ,  all right ,  don &apos;t tell me ,  i &apos;ll go along with it ,  it &apos;s just irritating to me i can &apos;t figure it out . 
where are the guards ? 
god bless you ,  sir . 
how many ? 
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate .   i &apos;d like the chance to defend myself .   i &apos;d like my wife to have that chance .   my civilian engineers .  my secretary . 
he &apos;s a friend of yours ,  you want to help him out .  tell me this ,  though  -  has he ever once shown you his appreciation ?   i &apos;ve yet to see it .  never a courtesy .   never a thank you note .   he forgets my wife at christmas time  - 
pots and pans . 
four hundred ,  four fifty  - 
i &apos;ll talk to you later . 
he &apos;s stealing from you ,  oskar . 
how &apos;s the name search going ? 
we &apos;re co - sponsoring the acid rain mixer at the sig ep .  house tonight . 
why do you always answer a question with a question ? 
hello ?  ted ? 
what do you want from me ,  cotton ? 
well ,  you know i &apos;m dear to the subject matter . 
already did .  he &apos;s the perfect suspect ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
what are you going to do ? 
my documentary is due on tuesday . 
it &apos;s okay .  i can peddle toilet paper . 
where have you been &apos; ?  you missed my shining moment .  i won the macaroni sundae binge . 
i had the four o &apos;clock shift .  you weren &apos;t there .  you had us worried .  is everything okay ? 
yeah ,  you look quizzical yet pensive . 
youre the one who got away . 
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings . 
yes ,  i do retain reading skills .  shock . 
a bloody knife .  a ghost mask .  something like that ? 
maybe not .  but think about the sex .  as frustrated as i am .  .  . 
hey ,  i got stuff to do .  but i &apos;ll find you later ,  okay . 
what do you want ? 
oh -  - a god complex
you &apos;re getting obvious . 
he tried to kill her first . 
knock yourself out . 
okay ,  you &apos;re sure about skipping calculas ? 
the young girl is slashed again . 
sid ,  i &apos;ll seeya tonight . 
it &apos;s all about sisterhood .  everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but .  .  . 
 .  . it &apos;s really about family and tradition .  .  . 
what do you care ?  let  &apos;em have their fun .  so ,  what &apos;s up ? 
showgirls .  absolutely frightening .  what &apos;s yours ?  wait ,  let me guess .  the house on sorority row ?  final exam .  graduation day ?  the dorm that dripped blood ?  splatter university ?  am i close ? 
do you want to die ? 
why doesn &apos;t she just hang up and call the police ?  stupid .  . 
what are you talking about ? 
i &apos;ll be right back . 
oh that &apos;s right .  those poor poor people .  god ben damon was such a hottie . 
asshole ,  can &apos;t talk . 
you almost sound like that guy from there &apos;s something about carrie .  ben .  ben damon . 
listen you sick fuck ,  is this your idea of a joke ? 
what kind of a game ? 
it &apos;s cici !  cici &apos;s the name of the character she plays in the movie ! 
where are you ? 
i know every face in here ,  respect for the unknown actor i suppose ,  myself included .  if you &apos;re looking for maureen prescott  -  - 
what are these movies ?   &apos;amazombies &apos; ,   &apos;space psychos &apos;  &apos;creatures from thesan andreas fault &apos; ? 
ok ,  look .   we all know that this has something to do with  &apos;stab 3 &apos; .   what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott . 
boys ,  boys ,  why don &apos;t we compare our gun calibers later ?   the issue is maureen prescott ! 
jesus gale what happened ? 
nice to finally meet you ,  sidney . 
what are you doing here ?  i told you to stay hidden !  it &apos;s not safe for you up here . 
alright sid ,  over there is the stab 3 production offices .  that &apos;s where sarah darling was murdered last night . 
yeah ? 
you mean our past as in me and sid .  this has nothing to do with you gale . 
what &apos;s wrong with just being gale weathers ?  i liked her ! 
what part of  &apos;off the record &apos; don &apos;t you understand ? 
i &apos;ve got an idea ,  i &apos;ll hook up with you guys later . 
god damn it you two !  run !  hurry !  he &apos;s dead ! 
geez . 
nobody said she was an actor . 
i don &apos;t think so !   just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood ? 
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month .  the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs ,  and how i faked the tire blow - out just so my insurance wouldn &apos;t sky rocket . 
um hmm .  .  .   umhmm great ,  so let &apos;s run the lines . 
page 22 ,  candy &apos;s big moment . 
it &apos;s sarah . 
what are you talking about ?  the murders were a completely isolated incident . 
you &apos;re dead ! 
don &apos;t you want to know how you can help ,  sidney ?   are you listening to me ,  huh ? 
duh .  .  .  that &apos;s quick . 
dude .  what are you doing here ? 
where ya going ?  it &apos;s not over yet .  we &apos;ve got one more surprise  -  -  stu ,  i believe it &apos;s your turn . 
nope . 
think about it .  on the off chance i get caught  -  -  a motive like that could divide a jury for years ,  don &apos;t you think ?  .  you took my mother ,  so i took yours .  big sympathy factor .  maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior .  it certainly fucked you up .  it made you have sex with a psychopath . 
this is the best part ,  sid .  billy &apos;s got it all figured out .  why do you think we kept your father alive so long ?  why did we save you for last ? 
what if your father snapped ?  your mom &apos;s anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree ,  killing everyone .  .  . 
and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head .  it &apos;s a perfect ending . 
she can &apos;t get both of us . 
i don &apos;t know billy but i &apos;m hurtin &apos; . 
my dad &apos;s in the other room . 
you know what my dad will do to you ? 
so .  .  . 
i think in some weird analytical ,  psychological bullshit way i &apos;m scared i &apos;m gonna turn out just like her ,  you know ?  like the bad seed or something .  .  . 
you heard me . 
no ,  sheriff burke called your dad .  i saw him . 
no !  don &apos;t believe him . 
why did you kill my mother ? 
hello ? 
hello . 
uh .  .  .  halloween .  you know ,  the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters .  what &apos;s yours ? 
nah ,  i don &apos;t think so .  .  . 
gotta go . 
no .  .  .  please . 
but you &apos;re doing so well . 
and why is that ?  has something happened ? 
evening ,  ma &apos;am . 
not much story here .  just a bunch of kids cutting loose . 
keeping an eye on things .  checking the place out . 
so is dewey your real name ? 
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism . 
i &apos;ll call for backup . 
hey .  .  .  dewey .  can we go now ? 
what did mama tell you ?  when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law . 
at the airport . 
billy was released .  his cellular bill was clean .  he didn &apos;t make those calls . 
i know .  we &apos;re checking every cellular account in the county .  any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross - referenced .  it &apos;s gonna take time but we &apos;ll find him . 
she &apos;s tough . 
dewey !  where the hell you been ,  boy ? 
jesus .  .  . 
jesus christ !  an innocent man on death row .  a killer still on the loose .  kenny ,  tell me i &apos;m dreaming . 
it &apos;s okay ,  tatum .  she &apos;s just doing her job .  right ,  gale ? 
he was drunk that night .  he left his coat at your house ,  after your mother seduced him .  .  . 
cut some slack .  she watched her mom get butchered . 
why would you call me from my front porch ? 
you coming tonight ? 
you &apos;re such a little lap dog .  he &apos;s got killer printed all over his forehead . 
which is you .  .  . 
his movie nut mind has snapped ,  sid .  he &apos;s gone psycho . 
remember ,  there &apos;s safety in numbers . 
guess ,  i won &apos;t be needing this anymore . 
or a man &apos;s mentality . 
uh - huh ,  it &apos;s just .  .  .  you know ,  the police and reporters .  .  .  it brings it all back . 
good ,   &apos;cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video .  i was thinkin &apos; tom cruise in all the right moves .  you know ,  if you pause it just right you can see his penis . 
it &apos;s okay .  she was supposed to pick me up . 
just another sleepover at the riley &apos;s . 
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth .  maybe he was having an affair with your mom . 
i didn &apos;t say that ,  sid .  but you know there were rumors .  your dad was always out of town on business .  maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman . 
there &apos;s that sense of humor .  i knew it still existed .  ohh ,  sid ,  let &apos;s have some fun tonight . 
because there &apos;s no way a girl could have killed them . 
i don &apos;t have anyone else to give this to ,  somerset ,  you know that .   and nobody &apos;s going to swap with you . 
how you feeling ? 
what &apos;s so exciting ? 
what time is it ? 
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ? 
innocent ?   is that supposed to be funny ?  look at the people i killed .   an obese man ,  a disgusting man who could barely stand up .  .  .  who if you saw him on the street ,  you &apos;d point so your friends could mock him along with you .   who if you saw him while you were eating ,  you wouldn &apos;t be able to finish  your meal .   after him i picked the lawyer .   and ,  you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one .   this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster .  .  .  to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets . 
you &apos;ve made a good life for yourself .  .  . 
here he comes . 
not here . 
who said this was murder ? 
when we found him ,  he was lying there with a knife in his back ,  so what else could it be but homicide ?   except ,  i finally figured out .  .  .  he held the knife behind him .  .  .  put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall .  .  .  then he shoved his body backwards .  .  . 
it could be nothing . 
all television does is teach children that it &apos;s really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day . 
the leather chair was soaked through with sweat . 
did you read them ? 
for now ,  let &apos;s just consider the books as the murderer &apos;s inspiration .  the books and sermons are about atonement for sin .   and ,  these murders have been like forced attrition . 
no witnesses of any kind ? 
i wish i still thought like you . 
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away ,  on the slim chance it &apos;s ever needed in a courtroom .   it &apos;s like collecting diamonds on a desert island .   you keep them just in case you ever get rescued ,  but it &apos;s a pretty big ocean out there . 
the fingerprints . 
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here .   no matter how hard it is ,  we have to stay focused on the details . 
sorry about that .  .  .  i just .  .  . 
victor &apos;s landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month .   he says ,  quote ,   &quot; i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three - o - one ,  and nobody ever complained about him .   he &apos;s the best tenant i &apos;ve ever had . 
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism . 
the writings of saint thomas aqu .  .  .  aquin .  .  . 
the irony is ,  after a day of the type of work he did ,  he &apos;d come home and read me these morbid crime stories .   murders in the rue morgue .   le fanu &apos;s green tea .   my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours . 
if john doe &apos;s head splits open and a u . f . o .  flies out ,  i want you to have expected it . 
put your gun down !  ! 
i &apos;m sorry about this ,  mrs .  gould .   i really am . 
i need you to look at each one carefully .  .  .  very carefully .   look for anything that seems strange or out of place .   anything at all . 
don &apos;t worry .   i don &apos;t wear it at the dinner table . 
i was close once .   it just didn &apos;t happen . 
i don &apos;t know why i asked you to come . 
yes .   look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here . 
but mose harper said .  .  .

you were not dead before .  when i thought you dead ,  i did not care about all the plays that will never come ,  only that i would never see your face .  i saw our end ,  and it will come . 
 &quot; thou need &apos;st not to be gone .  &quot; 
at sea ,  then -  - a voyage to a new world ? she lands upon a vast and empty shore .  she is brought to the dukeorsino .

about this guy ,  this hugo person . 
he made it clear . 
only on expenses . 
when are you going to let the police know ? 
no ,  not that . 
don &apos;t you worry about that . 
how much did you pay ? 
what ?  yes ,  that &apos;s fine . 
what for ?  what did you want ?  the money ?  was that it ? 
but they know . 
sex lines ?  is that it ?  triple x - rated interactive fantasy ?  old habits die hard . 
are you recording it ? 
it looks like he &apos;s writing everything down . 
i &apos;ve never seen any of these men before . 
when you get up in the morning ,  how do you decide what shade of black to wear ? 
did you know  -  - 
has he tried down the back of the fridge ?  i mean ,  that &apos;s where i normally find things . 
 -  -  instead of what he is  -  - 
 -  -  which is  -  - 
know and love ? 
i think you &apos;re lying . 
hugo . 
i will ask you once more ,  what sort of car  -  - 
hugo .  hugo .  sorry about this ,  but can you open the door ?  it &apos;s us ,  hugo ,  your flatmates and companions .  your new - found friends .  he &apos;s not in .  he &apos;s left and we &apos;ll probably never see him again . 
i wonder how he did it ? 
thats not a story ,  alex .  it &apos;s a corpse . 
cameron .  you remember cameron . 
will you calm down . 
aren &apos;t you going to answer it ? 
i refuse . 
it makes us feel a whole lot better . 
don &apos;t you ever stop ? 
good evening .  i &apos;m detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell .  i wonder if we could ask you some questions . 
it &apos;s about the burglary . 
we understood there were four people living here .  not always ,  of course ,  but now ,  four . 
are you all right ? 
two hundred pounds . 
so let &apos;s go .

anyway ,  you remember harold ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  i think .  .  . 
then what &apos;s the problem ? 
you suggested it ,  don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a good idea ? 
 -  -  yes ,  senator  -  -  just a minute ,  dear  -  - 
that girl &apos;s making an awful spectacle of herself . 
 -  -  is that right ? 
what &apos;re you looking for ? 
what ? 
she did ? 
i can see that . 
all i ever do is play .  i should be doing something to get my own shop open . 
what about ? 
is she all right ? 
no ,  i know . 
hi . 
sweetheart ,  it &apos;s a bore out there .  .  .  let &apos;s lock the door . 
how do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked ?  particularly in your business .  .  .  you deal with women every day .  .  . 
nothing ,  i guess .  .  .  have you ever made it with a guy ? 
well ,  are you ? 
i &apos;d like to do your hair sometime . 
right now ? 
i &apos;ve got the customers .  .  .  that &apos;s my point .  i &apos;m the one they want .  if i had my own shop ,  they &apos;d leave and come to me .  i have a lot of customers . 
you &apos;re late ,  we &apos;re all backed up and you &apos;re supposed to go to buffums . 
you promised you &apos;d do the show . 
you do it . 
 -  -  well no .  it never came up . 
if you screw me up for tonight ,  i &apos;ll kill you ,  i swear to god ,  i &apos;ll kill you .

do you know what that lillian bercovici just did ? 
oh yeah ? 
 -  -  white ladies ?

hi ,  george . 
nothing ,  i reconciled with ron ,  you know ,  the guy i divorced last summer .

gunshots ,  there were some gunshots . 
but in the same house ,  you know ,  one house . 
yeah ,  baby .  .  . 
hey ,  i &apos;m ,  you know  -  -

 -  -  well aren &apos;t you  -  - 
bullshit . 
that was him . 
what do you wanna know for ? 
 -  -  yes . 
stop it . 
yes ,  yes ,  i did . 
it &apos;s an unusual trade . 
well ,  george ,  i invest for a lot of people .  i make a lot of money for them .  more than they could do for themselves . 
tonight ? 
i wish my son knew what he wanted to do . 
 .  .  .  she &apos;s very upset .  .  . 
i know it ,  i know it . 
this really ought to be layered .  .  . 
i wanna hear it from you ! 
well maybe i can get you something . 
well ,  whatever i am ,  i think i can get you whatever you &apos;d like . 
who were you talking to ? 
you and your touchy investors . 
shut the door ,  shut the door ! 
george ,  glad you could make it ,  son .  hi ,  doll . 
who &apos;s the guy ,  george &apos;s boyfriend ? 
i am ?  i mean why ? 
you &apos;re really a love  -  -  you sure ? 
five times a day ? 
after four years ?  no i don &apos;t .  .  .  and i don &apos;t know too many girls who do . 
 -  -  yesss ? 
 .  .  .  my friend doesn &apos;t like it here either . 
what does he do ?  is he an actor ? 
good for you . 
well  -  -  as i see it we &apos;ve got two choices .  we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off ,  or we can go to my party . 
what did you say your name was ,  sweetheart ? 
you seem disappointed . 
look ,  is there somewhere else you &apos;d rather go ?  maybe we can change our location . 
how &apos;s it going ,  doc ? 
i can &apos;t .   i have too much to do . 
yes i do .   i love it .   don &apos;t you ? 
now this is where we keep all of out meat .   you got fifteen rib roasts  -  thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers .   you got twelve -  turkeys ,  two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb .   do you like lamb ,  doc ? 
it &apos;s like i go to sleep ,  and he shows me things but when i wake up ,  i can &apos;t remember everything . 
well ,  you know doc ,  when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind .  .  .  say like is someone burns toast . 
no i ain &apos;t . 
yeah ,  i guess so . 
we &apos;ll get something as soon as we get to the hotel ,  okay ? 
i won &apos;t make any noise . 
if jack won &apos;t come with us ,  we &apos;ll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves .   that &apos;s all there is to it . 
danny ? 
mommy .  .  . 
is tony one of your animals ? 
because he hides . 
won &apos;t keep you a moment ,  sir . 
delbert grady . 
good evening ,  mr .  halloran .   what can i do for you ? 
dick ,  if you &apos;re ready to do it now ,  i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs .  torrance the kitchen ,  while i continue on with jack . 
it &apos;s good to see you . 
no charge ? 
eleven thirty  -  jesus ! 
well ,  something &apos;ll come .   it &apos;s just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day . 
jack ! 
stay away from me !   please .  .  . 
wendy .  .  . 
give me the bat . 
five months of peace is just what i want . 
good .   glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen .   is your family having a look around ? 
oh .  .  . well this is our gold ballroom . 
holy - jumped - up - baldheaded - jesus - christ ! 
what &apos;s the money for ? 
mom was really mad at him this time ,  wasn &apos;t she ? 
there &apos;s a saying -  so - and - so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick .  you ever hear that one ? 
you gave me a heart attack ,  marty .  i &apos;m dying .  i hope you &apos;re happy ,  because you are looking at a dying man . 
it wasn &apos;t -  i &apos;ll bet you it wasn &apos;t .  because to get a prescription he &apos;d have to see a doctor . 
i think he &apos;s going to come for me .  not just because i know who he is ,  but because i hurt him .  only i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll try again as lowe . 
i can &apos;t wait until next sunday ,  when the choir performs again .   did you see the people walk right in from the street ?  that music ,  that heavenly music  -  -  it called to them . 
but how ? 
how come ?   sister ? 
come on  -  -  stay .   just a little .   we can talk ,  i &apos;ll get a pizza .   pizza in bed ,  we &apos;ll have fun .   and you still haven &apos;t told me what happened .   what did she say ? 
you are so damn sexy . 
how did i get so lucky ?   what is it now ,  five years we &apos;ve been together ?   who do i thank ? 
for the first time in i don &apos;t know how long .   i wanted everything done right .  open and above board .   i told father antonelli i was in love .   i told him it was a special love ,  for all the ages . 
what ?  
you bastard ! 
isn &apos;t it a glorious morning ?   good morning ,  mary clarence .   sleep well ? 
what is it ,  mary ? 
yeah ,  for one second .   that was the blend  -  -  you &apos;ve got to listen to each other .   be a group . 
it &apos;ll be hell . 
van cartier . 
hey  -  -  you re supposed to be the cheerful one .   why do i suddenly feel like snow white ? 
three years .   a rookie . 
i can &apos;t wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences .   i &apos;ve learned so much . 
mary clarence ! 
oh my lord ! 
what was all that ?   who was that man ?  why would he shoot at us ? 
we &apos;re the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit ,  now do your part
wait ,  this isn &apos;t the way .   who are you ? 
i was downhearted
christy .   christy van cartier . 
sit down . 
miss van cartier . 
surely you are familiar with this practice ,  mary clarence .   only when our lips are silent ,  can our prayers truly be heard . 
a fast .   to remind us of the poor ,  of those who must endure without enough to eat . 
this shall be your cell ,  mary clarence . 
you were right the first time .   is this like ,  solitary ?   the cooler ?   where &apos;s the furniture ? 
wait .   no .   you &apos;re kidding .   lights out ?  at nine ?   my day &apos;s just starting . 
yeah ? 
a balloon and a banana !   tell me ,  mary clarence ,  what were you thinking ? 
isn &apos;t that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals ? 
hey  -  -  your prayers have been answered .  i &apos;m leaving .   in just a couple of days . 
what ? 
reverend mother  -  -  thank - you . 
from vince ?   what a guy .   doo - lang ,  doo -  lang . 
when are you gonna get off my case ?  have you got a search warrant ?   what do you want  -  -  cheap thrills ? 
okay ,  here &apos;s what i want .   i know about this stuff .   a five - star hotel .   with room service . 
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ? 
you &apos;re not .  .  .  seeing anybody ? 
i have ? 
don &apos;t you have a concert to go to ? 
hey ,  girls . 
i &apos;m sorry  -  -  i don &apos;t know what gets into him . 
but you didn &apos;t tell me ! 
and if she runs ? 
it &apos;s done ? 
get her ! 
so that guy in the bar was right ?   she &apos;s like .  .  .  some kind of nun ? 
you didn &apos;t shoot ! 
it should be here any minute . 
we sound terrible   we need mary clarence . 
she shouldn &apos;t have come back .   she knew she was in danger . 
peace on earth . 
is this like your old convent ? 
mary clarence ,  don &apos;t be silly .   you &apos;re an example to us all .   you &apos;ve taught us so much .   we &apos;re singing for the cardinals ,  and then  -  -  who knows ?   maybe the choir can travel  -  -  to schools ,  and nursing homes . 
calm down .   think clearly .   mary robert ,  do you have any idea who those men were ? 
we &apos;re a small convent ,  bishop .   surely there are .  .  .  more appropriate shelters . 
um .  .  .  i .  .  .  i did not .  .  .  no .   why ? 
we haven &apos;t heard your name yet ,  friend . 
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side . 
stains of blood . 
only if i repeat them outside this room .   and ,  i will if i must .  .  .   out there ,  for all to hear .   or .  .  .  you may speak ,  as planned .   but ,  you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures . 
may i see them ,  master hardenbrook ? 
damn .  .  .  damn .  .  .  damn .  .  . 
without disrespect ,  look around you .   we overflow .   as do our courts . 
why would he flee this direction ,  with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover ? 
i manage fine alone . 
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies .   to the tree of the dead .   maybe we passed it by . 
all i saw was their lantern . 
only the heirs were killed .   proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment . 
there are no other doors .   this is as far as she could have gone . 
what books ? 
he has proposed to me twice . 
he only appears to be inside the cage .   the point being .  .  . 
thank you .   no .   here .  .  . 
very well .   but ,  it will only sit gathering dust . 
you promised justice . 
what are you on about ? 
she is not your birth mother ,  is she ? 
van ripper .   can you show where the body lay ? 
all right then ,  i &apos;ll see y &apos;all later .  karl you done a good day &apos;s work .  they right about you .  scooter ,  he &apos;s gonna knock you out of a job if you &apos;re not careful .  i &apos;ll see you tomorrow . 
hey jerry ,  how it &apos;s goin &apos; .  good to see you .  been a long time . 
that old man of his still livin &apos; over there on clark street i believe . 
we run outta somethin &apos; to drink .  goin &apos; to the county line .  you want to race ? 
he &apos;s just mentally retarded ,  i guess . 
he &apos;ll be here in a little while ,  he &apos;s takin &apos; me to get an ice cream . 
you &apos;re not stayin &apos; here tonight .  go get sober before you come back .  i &apos;m tired of my child seein &apos; this .  now you get yourself straight or i &apos;ll lock your ass out of my life for good . 
leave . 
sure ,  i guess . 
you like that vaughan ? 
i wanted for you to meet karl ,  too .  he &apos;s my new friend .  but i feel like i &apos;ve always known him .  i thought you should meet him . 
he &apos;s gonna be around a lot and i hope you are too ,  so .  .  . 
how come you &apos;re carryin &apos; them around with you . 
they let you out ? 
how did your mama die ? 
i like the way you talk . 
it &apos;s name &apos;s a christmas carol . 
you want to go with me ? 
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they &apos;re home .  reckon why they don &apos;t like me ? 
what do you mean ? 
bible says the same thing about killin &apos; others ,  too . 
she said she &apos;d see me later .  that &apos;s kinda good ,  right ? 
i know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing  &apos;em over to me . 
i care for you ,  too .  but you &apos;ll be around ,  don &apos;t say that . 
ever &apos;thing &apos;s okay ,  boy .  i kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then i &apos;m gonna go on and leave here . 
hey ,  mama .  hey ,  vaughan . 
oh ,  that &apos;s karl .  i met him at the laundrymat .  karl ,  this is my mama .  and vaughan ,  vaughan &apos;s the manager .  he lets mama off any time she feels like it  &apos;cause they &apos;re best friends . 
i promise we &apos;re gonna get away from him .  the time has to be right ,  that &apos;s all .  i &apos;d rather him get tired of me and leave me .  then he wouldn &apos;t want to hurt me .  he wouldn &apos;t care then .  we &apos;ll be fine .  i promise .  you go to bed now .   i love you . 
well ,  at least he &apos;s tryin &apos; .  but who knows for how long . 
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin &apos; .  how far did you want to go ? 
i reckon i &apos;m gonna have to get used to them lookin &apos; at me ,  too . 
karl ,  what in the world are you doing here ? 
listen ,  karl ,  the truth is i don &apos;t know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do .  if it was up to me ,  i &apos;d let you stay here if that &apos;s what you wanted .  i &apos;m just doin &apos; my job .   you follow me ?   listen ,  i know an old boy that runs a fix - it shop deal down in millsburg .  he used to go to church with me .  you &apos;re good workin &apos; on small engines and things .  if i put my neck out for you with him ,  will you work at it if he &apos;ll hire you ? 
two fellers was on a bridge a takin &apos; a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water .  one of  &apos;em came from arkansas ,  i believe . 
mustard &apos;s good on  &apos;em to me . 
where are you goin &apos; ,  karl ?  didn &apos;t you want some chicken and things ? 
yeah . 
i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually .  you should see all the books he has .  he must read constantly . 
frank ,  don &apos;t talk that way .  who &apos;s that strange lookin &apos; man behind you ?  did he follow you in here ? 
i think there must have been a little mix up .  i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is ,  there couldn &apos;t be any pictures .  it &apos;s s &apos;posed to be just a little story or article or something ,  isn &apos;t that right ? 
but ,  here &apos;s the thing .  he &apos;ll only talk to you .  he doesn &apos;t want you to ask him anything .  and you shouldn &apos;t stare at him . 
yes . 
and how many people will be attending this birthday party ? 
your dissertation ?  what subject do you study ? 
i finished my story .  i thought you might want to take a look at it . 
do you think i could buy some before you leave ? 
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it . 
so what did he say when he called ? 
you usually get two . 
i &apos;m all ears . 
it was a good deed ,  auggie .  it was a nice thing you did for her . 
i know what it means .  that still don &apos;t make it a good name . 
so you &apos;re just going to give up and go home ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
there &apos;s just one thing i want to know . 
shit .  you should have been married to someone by now .  you know ,  settled down somewhere with a kid or two ,  a nice steady job . 
sounds like another one of your stories to me . 
i &apos;ve got to get moving .  terry will bust my chops if i &apos;m late .  see you in september ,  auggie . 
i &apos;ll be back in about an hour .  watch the register while i &apos;m gone ,  okay ? 
what do you care where it comes from ?  it &apos;s yours . 
come on ,  come on ,  you yellow belly .  the whole thing .  first name and last name . 
that &apos;s how it is with sidewalks .  people come ,  people go ,  and they all drop shit on the ground .  as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next ,  the first spot is dirty again . 
sure ,  auggie ,  i got it .   the store &apos;s closed .   and when do i tell them it &apos;s open ? 
they don &apos;t come cheap ,  son .  these little honeys are works of art .  rolled by hand in a tropical climate ,  most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on .  little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage .  the smooth ,  delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another .  .  . 
seventy - eight dollars .  the girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties . 
it &apos;ll keep them fresh .  if they get too dry ,  they &apos;ll break .  and you don &apos;t want that to happen ,  do you ?   tobacco is a plant ,  and it needs the same loving care you &apos;d give an orchid . 
i &apos;m looking for my nephew ,   thomas . 
i always knew that boy had an imagination ,  but now he &apos;s gone and made up a whole new life for himself .   do you mind if i sit down ?   he &apos;s been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby .  and we don &apos;t live in manhattan .  we live in boerum hill .  in the projects . 
well ,  one thing i suppose ,  but i don &apos;t think it has anything to do with this .   a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she &apos;d spotted thomas &apos;s father working at some gas station outside of peekskill . 
and nothing .  thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said ,   &quot; i don &apos;t have a father .  as far as i &apos;m concerned ,  that son - of - a - bitch is dead .  &quot; 
no ,  i don &apos;t suppose it has .  he was broken up like nobody &apos;s business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead . 
why don &apos;t you pick some other spot ?  it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning . 
let me give you some useful information ,  son .  there &apos;s two dollars and fifty - seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you &apos;ve put in casing the joint so far ,  you won &apos;t make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains .  however you slice it ,  that &apos;s a losing proposition . 
i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll be working on a strictly freelance basis . 
you still have that watch auggie gave you ? 
well ,  if you put it that way .  .  . 
that &apos;s all right .  if i think of something ,  i &apos;ll send my butler over to tell you . 
people don &apos;t do that kind of thing .  not in new york . 
i used to have one ,  but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it .   i &apos;d just as soon not have one anyway .  i hate those damn things . 
my father did .  believe it or not ,  that little baby is me . 
it &apos;s strange ,  though ,  isn &apos;t it ?  looking at yourself before you knew who you were . 
jesus ,  do you make a lot of noise .  can &apos;t you see i &apos;m trying to work ? 
where did you get that thing ? 
cut it out ,  will you ?  just cut it out and come back here . 
you &apos;re joking ,  right ?  i mean ,  that &apos;s your way of trying to be funny ,  right ? 
if i tell you ,  i might not be able to finish it . 
celebrate ?  what for ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
and started to run . 
do you have real iced coffee ,  or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes ? 
fries ? 
none . 
with no bone or scalp or hair present .   would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man &apos;s skull .  .  . 
just three questions .   the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500 ? 
it is . 
so the fishing gaff method wouldn &apos;t make sense ? 
compressed air horn ,  most likely .  hope to god some man hears you in that fog . 
you thought the deceased might .  .  .  break his promise ? 
we discussed that .   and decided not to . 
i can just feel my spirits soar . 
there can &apos;t be any wrong in this ,  ha .  .  . 
they &apos;re not his neighbor ,  like you are .   he is a husband ,  a father ,  he risked his life< / u> for their< / u> country .  the same as you . 
your father fought at belleau wood ,  it took him years to get over it .   nightmares ,  tears ,  b .  .  . 
so ,  no .  .  . immediate suspicion ,  no .  .  . general talk of enmity between the two . 
did you say more ? 
well ,  i was a doctor in the jap theater ,  in the war .   i saw those kendo wounds ,  many< / u> times .   looked exactly like this one . 
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork .   what is your expertise ,  sir ,  are you a detective of sorts ? 
and i wouldn &apos;t blame these good people if they were a mite resent -  ful .   at a tactic that insults their intelligence . 
and then your stroke came this summer .   and you put your property on the market ,  i believe you said september 7 .   which ,  remember ,  is eight< / u> days before carl heine died .  and who comes spetember 7 ,  wanting to buy ? 
it &apos;s on the twine ,  too .   but it &apos;s not r .  .  . 
miyamoto gave him the battery ,  and left .   carl &apos;s boat was running ,  he goes back to fishing .   but at some point ,  he thinks of the lantern .  .  . 
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there .   so he climbs up .   to cut it down . 
you always run with the well open ? 
you gaff with the hook< / u> end .  blood &apos;s on the butt .   where your hand goes . 
you think that is< / u> the truth . 
i think you testified all< / u> the lights were on .   cabin ,  mast ,  net lights ,  picking lights .  .  . 
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery .   a d - 6 is one inch wider than a d - 8 .   it would be too large for the deceased &apos;s well . 
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no< / u> spare battery ,  hmmn ? 
i believe so . 
one d - 6 and one d - 8 in the well .  and a dead d - 8 on the deck . 
is it possible ? 
is it fair to say that you do not know for certain< / u> which it was . 
can i say something ,  here ? 
you &apos;re welcome . 
he even got charlie &apos;s last toothpick  -  the one from the garage  -  and had it gold - plated . 
say ,  joe  -  tonight &apos;s the night ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
i mean ,  we get paid tonight ,  don &apos;t we ? 
because i lost a filling in my back tooth .  i gotta go to the dentist tomorrow . 
first thing tomorrow we &apos;re going to pay everybody a little something on account . 
you mean it &apos;s a girls &apos; band ? 
i feel so naked .   like everybody &apos;s looking at me . 
when i was a kid ,  i used to have a dream  -  i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight  -  with all kinds of goodies around  -  jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts  - 
not there  -  that &apos;s the emergency brake . 
done what ? 
i changed it .   it used to be sugar kowalczyk . 
good night ,  daphne . 
tell him you get seasick on a yacht .  play miniature golf with him . 
we &apos;ll take a rain check .

good night ,  sugar .

come on ,  sugar  -  time to change for dinner . 
oh ,  please do come .   don &apos;t disappoint us .  it &apos;ll be such fun .   and bring your yacht . 
well ,  i &apos;ll be  -   !    how about that guy ? 
thirty - four . 
it &apos;s about the florida job .

i &apos;m not interested at all . 
yeah .   real hot . 
so do i .   as a matter of fact ,  i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music . 
they do indeed .   daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent ,  but i don &apos;t care .  it was such a bore  -  coming - out parties ,  cotillions  - 
well ,  he &apos;s young and handsome and a bachelor  -  and he &apos;s a real gentleman  -  not one of these grabbers . 
three ? 
water polo  -  isn &apos;t that terribly dangerous ? 
what &apos;s on thursdays ? 
you mean we &apos;re alone on the boat ? 
it &apos;s not the icebergs .   but there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this . 
what thing ? 
have you tried ? 
not anymore .   i was in love once  -  but i &apos;d rather not talk about it .   how about a little cold pheasant ? 
ever since then  -   numb  -  no feelings .   like my heart was shot full of novocaine . 
my family did everything they could  -  hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids  -  got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston  -  imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails  -  what a waste of money ! 
would you do me a favor ? 
would you like a little more champagne ?   and maybe if we had some music  -    -  how do you dim these lights ? 
really ? 
i &apos;ll meet you on the pier again  -  right after the show . 
oh ,  of course .   i understand .   at least ,  i think i do . 
oh .   the navigator just came in  -  we &apos;re ready to cast off . 
what &apos;s the matter ,  sugar ? 
what &apos;ll it be ,  sir ? 
scotch coffee ,  canadian coffee ,  sour - mash coffee .  .  . 
i heard you opera - lovers were having a little rally  -  so i thought i better be around in case anybody decides to sing . 
because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats  -  they had blood on them . 
yeah .   you never know who &apos;s going to be next .   okay ,  spats .   report to the sergeant -  at - arms . 
hello ,  charlie .   long time no see .

my fellow americans .  i have led this fight in the war against profanity .  i have founded mothers against canada .   our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time . 
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers .   it &apos;s the only way to ensure that their smut can &apos;t reach american soil ! 
and bill ? 
terrance and phillip are two very untalented ,  unfunny actors from canada .  their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage .   now it appears they have a movie and i &apos;m positive it &apos;s not suitable for children !

look ,  kid ,  gimme a break .  i &apos;m an old man .   i &apos;m runnin &apos; on a delrin aorta .  i &apos;m finished  -  dead from my ankles up .

what did you do to buzz ? 
junior . 
we &apos;re having a party for you ,  boy .  cake and shish - k - bob ,  just like you love .  junior cringes away from the light .

i am not leaving without him .   do you hear me ?   we come down as a team ,  we leave as a team . 
norman ! 
they told me about sixty hours . 
fifty yards and closing . 
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface .   but we &apos;ve never used it underwater before . 
thirty yards . 
then why am i here ? 
maybe older  -  - 
he &apos;s missing .   he &apos;s gone .   he left . 
you can &apos;t just leave harry down here ,  sir . 
i &apos;m not paranoid .   i know beth .   she can be drastic . 
you don &apos;t think weapons are important ? 
damn it ,  edmunds ? 
what caused it ? 
norman ,  get out of there now !  norman ? 
right .   so you &apos;re saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch ? 
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere . 
man is man ,  all he knows is man ,  and all he can think of is what he knows .   the anthropomorphic problem .  good ,  norman . 
or it could contain some great benefit to us ,  some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind . 
are you enjoying yourself ,  harry ,  because i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re doing . 
not now ,  beth .   please .   i want to know who we &apos;re talking to before we start talking .   where &apos;s edmunds ? 
time travel .   i always thought it was one of those myths .  .  .  like santa &apos;s reindeer . 
it &apos;s not talking ,  it &apos;s mimicking . 
beth ,  look ,  can i trust you with a little secret ? 
you &apos;re next ,  norman . 
400 years ago ?   i &apos;m sure christopher columbus would &apos;ve loved these accomodations . 
i mean ,  i &apos;m not .  .  .  i wasn &apos;t absolutely sure if .  .  .  they  -  - 
nobody said .  .  .  norman .  .  .   what ?   why are you looking at me like that ? 
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .   i didn &apos;t mean .  .  . 
he &apos;s not just a navy captain  -  -  he works for the fucking pentagon . 
yeah ,  okay .   sure ,  norman . 
forget the sub . 
you should know how it works .   just in case . 
i don &apos;t trust harry to do it . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
still clear ? 
 .  .  .  what do you mean ?   i &apos;m in the ship . 
you get it straightened out ? 
that wasn &apos;t in there before . 
you think it &apos;s me ?   you think i &apos;m saying there was a conversation when there wasn &apos;t ? 
after the attack ,  a navy guy woke me up  -  -  i don &apos;t know  -  -  i thought he was an illusion .   but i checked the tape ,  and jerry said he manifested him . 
he acquired some sort of power .   a power to manifest things . 
it &apos;s his fear .   the squid .   he &apos;s manifesting his fears .   making them real . 
looks like some sort of code . 
riordan ? 
parasolutrine ? 
three to six hours . 
what ?   wait  -  -  isn &apos;t that dangerous ? 
what was that ?   i couldn &apos;t hear you . 
what &apos;s wrong ,  norman ? 
it &apos;s getting cold . 
what are they doing down here ?   in the bathroom ?   suddenly appearing . 
did you ? 
yes . 
that &apos;s bullshit . 
of course you &apos;re going to deny it .  you want to blame someone else .   you want to blame beth .   because you hate beth . 
you hear that ? 
how &apos;s that ? 
pry the thing open ?   what are we  -  -  neanderthals ? 
what ? 
they &apos;re going to want answers and they &apos;re going to keep asking until they get them . 
c &apos;mon ,  norman . 
our answer . 
not a clue . 
i can &apos;t believe that ,  harry . 
look  -  -  we &apos;re under a lot of pressure ,  we &apos;re tired ,  you &apos;re not thinking straight . 
what is that ?   that noise ? 
harry ,  can you tell me about the sphere ? 
what happens on page 87 ?   have you ever read page 87 ? 
getting anywhere with those ? 
wisconsin &apos;s your answer . 
what is it ? 
three fifty - six ,  three fifty - five ,  three  -  - 
her legs are in the way . 
what &apos;d you say to him ? 
alot like .   you know ,  i noticed it before ,  but i didn &apos;t .  .  . 
a spacecraft half a mile long  -  -  with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it ?   someone went to a lot of trouble .   try again . 
why would this ship carry instructions in english ? 
looks like a design ,  some writing ,  maybe .   maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message . 
well ,  if it &apos;s a discharge  -  - 
 .  .  .  i asked myself ,  why would the sphere be using a code ?   if you &apos;re trying to communicate ,  why use a code ? 
captain barnes wants to see you right away ,  sir . 
physicists ,  mathematicians ,  geologists ,  you name it . 
it &apos;s not some fucking substitution code ,  it &apos;s a direct visual representation . 
what was it ? 
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume . 
i think there are some things we should talk about . 
luke &apos;s got a point .  .  .   .  .  .  fear is their greatest defense .  .  .  i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust ,  and what there is is most likely directed toward large - scale assault . 
we &apos;re into the second perimeter .  they &apos;ll be coming out to blast us shortly .   i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in ? 
sorry ,  but that was the only way to get you down . 
they use the bogan force . 
what &apos;s wrong ?   what &apos;s happening ? 
what is it ? 
six hours ,  huh ?   well ,  that &apos;s your ship there .   you &apos;re blue five .   you stay glued to me .   i don &apos;t want any independent operations out there .  personally i think it &apos;s foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this .   this is no joy ride we &apos;re going on . 
should we alert the sith lords ? 
we don &apos;t get many visitors .   let &apos;s take a look at it . 
i &apos;d keep that thing close just in case ,  if i were you .  .  .  i &apos;ve been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion ,  but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side . 
watch it !   move back . 
enough !   i already know about the data you &apos;ve intercepted ,  but its &apos; too late .   whatever information you &apos;ve gathered will be destroyed .  .  .  you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide .  .  . 
the  &apos;death star &apos; has become operational .   there is no force in the universe that can stop us now . 
are there medical facilities on yavin ? 
there &apos;s a lot of carbon scoring here .  it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action .  .  . 
i think we &apos;re going to need them .  blast it ! 
let him have it .   you &apos;re winning anyway .   it doesn &apos;t make any difference . 
wait a minute ,  slow down !  .  .  .  that &apos;s better .   they &apos;re where ?   they what ?  they are ?   oh ,  no !  we &apos;re going to be mashed into conduit before this is over .  .  . 
holy maker ,  threepio .   i forgot .  .  . 
you got some guts for a rich kid .  i guess you and me could be buddies . 
whad &apos;ya talkin  about  ? 
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise  ? 
how do you make him do that  ? 
i &apos;ve been thinking about applying for federal service ,  too .  fleet ,  maybe . 
please continue ,  sergeant . 
are you alright  ? 
it &apos;s amazing ,  us running into each other like this .  maybe it &apos;s fate . 
in simulation ,  my supervisors could never keep up . 
oh ,  yes ,  sir .  vector  ? 
profile &apos;s wrong .  .  .  there . 
she got a command .  .  .  and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her .  she thinks we &apos;re good together . 
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet .  .  . 
johnny ,  wait .  .  . 
so  ? 
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers .  you &apos;d probably get a promotion out of it . 
i &apos;m not kidding .  marriage is  - 
zander ,  what are you doing  ? 
wait ,  i want to talk to mr .  rasczak . 
none at all .  .  .  we won . 
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa  !

on your feet ,  fella .   i &apos;ve got to get outside and see how my men are . 
you &apos;ve wasted enough of my time ,  fella . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  sir .   general schmuck is asleep and he isn &apos;t taking calls until eight - thirty . 
ceida pietraszkiewicz .  .  . p .  .  . i .  .  . e .  .  .  t .  .  . r .  .  . a .  .  . s .  .  . z .  .  . k .  .  . i .  .  . e .  .  . w .  .  .  i .  .  . c .  .  . z . 
colonel ,  you &apos;re not drunk ,  are you ,  man ? 
does the threat board show anything ? 
just a second ,  sir .   he &apos;s got films of the war room in that thing ! 
you see ,  you knew the answer all the time ,  general . 
yes ,  sir . 
are you hard of hearing ,  major ? 
what &apos;s the gun for ,  general ripper ? 
certainly ,  major mandrake .   you &apos;re a good officer ,  and you can ask me a question any time you want to . 
that about right ? 
well ,  general  -  -  i was wondering ,  why are you doing this ?   i mean why do you want to start the war ? 
but when they do ,  sir ,  won &apos;t they hit back with everything they &apos;ve got ? 
i don &apos;t know ,  sir .   but they &apos;re just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are .  war just doesn &apos;t make sense any more ,  for anybody . 
general ,  now that you &apos;ve done that ,  i beg you to recall the wing . 
well ,  sir ,  plan - r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack . 
i &apos;m not certain ,  mister president .   but i believe it was four . 
he says they &apos;ve only shot down three planes .

fusing for ten thousand air burst . 
let &apos;s have a rundown on the damage ,  lothar ? 
what happened ? 
where &apos;d they get you ? 
i mean pulling a stunt like that . 
wait a minute ,  major .    &quot; ope ,  &quot;  that &apos;s the recall code .   where would they get that ? 
our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders .   and therefore ,  to disregard anything that doesn &apos;t come on the crm - 114 . 
then that settles it ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
it would not be difficult .   nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely .  greenhouses could maintain plant life .  animals could be bred and slaughtered .  a quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country ,  but i shouldn &apos;t be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd .  every nation would undoubtedly follow suit . 
uh ,  yeah ,  she should be coming by .

hey ,  i &apos;m sooze .

i don &apos;t think i like that guy &apos;s attitude at all .  hey ,  you know what ?  take off the blades .  i mean it .  i &apos;m gonna break your fucking legs .  take  &apos;em off . 
oh ,  you were in the band ? 
your his publicist ? 
oh ,  my god ,  you found it .  thank you so much .   did you get your tape ? 
i &apos;ll tell you what .  when i get my engineering degree and i &apos;m swimming in my swimming pool ,  it will be very fucking okay .

what &apos;d you do ? 
no . 
no ?  well ,  i disagree .  i think they did .  i think they probably went home last night and ,  you know ,  kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner ,  you know ?  makes me sick . 
no . 
jeff ,  stay there . 
this has nothing to do with me !  she went up by herself .  yeah i tell them don &apos;t go on the roof !  they can &apos;t go on the roof !   how is she ? 
i stand for honesty !  i stand for some level of truth !

so what do you wanna do ? 
new ground ?

yeah . 
yes ,  that &apos;s right .  you know what ,  honey ?  you should go to new york .  you should go .  go show  &apos;em .  they need your unique point of view . 
tim &apos;s jealous ,  you know ?  he wants to have ideas too . 
buff is funny ,  okay ?  she likes buff ,  so why don &apos;t you whip shut the feminist hole . 
forget about new york ,  jeff .  i don &apos;t want to talk about new york anymore . 
could you give me a ride ? 
the fuck not ? 
oh my g - d ,  i read about this !   it &apos;s called a  &quot; pregnancy insanity .  &quot;   quick ,  she needs a sitz bath  -  -

hey ,  hey ,  hey .   c &apos;mon you guys .   obviously that &apos;s a little more than our budget will allow .   basically ,  we &apos;re looking for something around two - hundred dollars . 
oh please ,  we &apos;ve all got bright futures ahead of us  -  we &apos;re not going to tell anyone .   promise ! 
hannah ,  in order to get real answers from the netherworld ,  you &apos;ve gotta have a christian virgin run the board .   your kind is pure of heart  -  the devil won &apos;t dick with you . 
i &apos;m only allowed  &quot; g &quot;  movies . 
all of you ! 
i know  -  that &apos;s what i said too .  anyway ,  we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank .

salome  -  -  what a woman !  what a part !  the princess in love with a holy man .   she dances the dance of the seven veils .   he rejects her ,  so she demands his head on a golden tray ,  kissing his cold ,  dead lips . 
of course it is . 
what month ? 
you can &apos;t work in an apartment where you owe three months &apos; rent . 
it &apos;s all taken care of .   it &apos;s all paid for . 
what scene ? 
they don &apos;t ?   then why do they still write me fan letters every day .  why do they beg me for my photo -  graphs ?   because they want to see me ,  me ,  me !   norma desmond . 
they &apos;ve come for my car . 
you know ,  to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit . 
shouldn &apos;t we wait for the others ? 
hold me tighter . 
keep it . 
i hope you realize ,  norma ,  that scripts don &apos;t sell on astrologers &apos; charts . 
i can still see myself in the line :  bebe daniels ,  marie prevost ,  mabel normand  .  .  .  mabel was always stepping on my feet  .  .  . what &apos;s the matter with you ,  darling ?   why are you so glum ? 
you &apos;d better get to bed yourself . 
suppose you listen just for a minute  - 
some men are here .   they asked for you . 
why don &apos;t you ?  i &apos;m writing a script and i &apos;m dying to finish it ,  no matter what . 
relax ,  fans .   the car isn &apos;t here . 
i lent it to a friend of mine .  he took it up to palm springs . 
haven &apos;t got a thing . 
cameras ?   .  .  . what is it ,  max ? 
i &apos;ve discovered a new way into the phantom zone . 
is he your entertainment for tonight ? 
that little girl ?  ha .   now go on ,  get me some tools . 
western europe . 
maybe it was just an accident . 
like it ? 
great !  i &apos;ii build a house -  -  right over there ,  with a veranda looking out to sea .  and i &apos;ll plant a garden !  papayas ,  pineapples ,  bananas ,  mangoes -  -  -  anything &apos;ll grow here .  and i &apos;ii fish in the lagoon ,  and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe ,  and -  -  - 
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said . 
that makes it worse . 
and now ? 
why not ?  you &apos;re a good - looking girl .  and i &apos;m -  -  -  available . 
you &apos;ve had your fun ,  selena ,  the game is over . 
to us .  and to the seeds we &apos;ll plant together . 
yes ,  yes i saw the whole thing .  how could you be interested in that puny little girl ? 
no ! 
you &apos;ve been without water for a whole day .  let &apos;s see how thirsty you get in a week . 
they want me .  doesn &apos;t it make you proud ? 
yes . 
jimmy ,  would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die ? 
superman will return it . 
what are you making : 
there isn &apos;t any . 
i &apos;d rather not talk about it . 
you &apos;re wasting your breath . 
i &apos;m free .  i can never thank you enough . 
you look at them ?  how ? 
there is a way . 
you &apos;re going to take me back ? 
i heard my mother ask you once  &quot; how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty ?  &quot;  she was wrong ,  zaltar ,  you have a generous heart . 
yes ,  mustn &apos;t stop . 
yeah ?  what do you want ? 
mr .  roebush ? 
got vodka in it now .  gotta give it a new name .  hey ,  listen ,  you thought it up ,  we &apos;ll name it after you .  what &apos;s your name ? 
you &apos;re welcome .  .  .  ?  ? 
so .  .  . how much longer do you think you &apos;ll be in smallville  -  - 
the dog &apos;s always doing that .   and the car &apos;s always doing that . 
mr .  kent !  superman was here ! 
so ,  mr .  white ?  can i go ahead and make my travel arrangements ? 
gee ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  lois .  but i &apos;ve already got a lunch date .  with mr .  white &apos;s new secretary . 
it &apos;s practically an american ritual ,  mr .  white !  isn &apos;t that so ,  jimmy ? 
you &apos;ve been a naughty boy haven &apos;t you ?   c &apos;mon now ,  admit it ,  you were kinda naughty . 
say ,  fella ,  i understand .  i can  -  -  what do the kids say these days  -  -   &quot; dig where you &apos;re comin &apos; from .  &quot;   you want to be rich ,  right ? 
i invented it ,  man .  in my head .  it &apos;s a stone killer - diller get - down get - it - on and twice - on - sunday super mutha computer . 
stone mutha . 
you want to mess with superman ? 
who &apos;s the other woman ? 
you &apos;re amazing ,  olsen .  a boring banquet and you bring back 3 , 000 boring pictures .  then superman puts out a fire on third avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don &apos;t take one picture !  ! 
there &apos;s no rush . 
it &apos;s hard to believe .  .  .  a great looking girl like you all alone like this .  as she glances up at him ,  she is first flustered ,  then flattered ,  then .  .  . finally .  .  . just realistic : 
what terrific story ? 
lots of things .  .  . 
why stop at coffee !   a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning ,  but what keeps the world working ? 
i can &apos;t see anything . 
where &apos;s the light switch ? 
come on ,  will you ?   we &apos;ve got to get ready before he gets here . 
mr .  white ,  you be in this shot ,  handing them their plane tickets . 
i don &apos;t know who .  whom .  i can &apos;t trace it .   in the old days it was simple .  we kept books ,  we had ledgers ,  we could see what was going in and what was paid out .  if somebody wanted to rob you ,  he &apos;d come in with a gun and say  &apos;stick  &apos;em up .  &quot;   now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work ! 
you mean .  .  . you mean .  .  . vera !  vera !  the magnitude of this !  !  ! 
so ? 
come on ,  let &apos;s give it a dry run . 
i don &apos;t ? 
where were you ? 
lois ,  i don &apos;t have the vaguest idea  -  -  as usual  -  -  what you &apos;re  -  - 
you &apos;ve been under a lot of pressure lately  - 
because of what i &apos;m betting .   my life . 
i was right .  you are superman . 
i didn &apos;t think i wanted to . 
i &apos;m in love with you .  how do you feel ? 
you did it .  you gave it all up for me .  i  .   .   .  i don &apos;t know what to say . 
clark  .   .   .  it doesn &apos;t matter  .   .   .  we can move  .   .   . 
 .   .   .  superman ?  .   .   .   .   . 
lex .  .  . lex ,  how could you do that to otis ? 
you &apos;ll have to pack quickly . 
well done ,  miss teschmacher . 
why didn &apos;t you go before we left ? 
game plan !  it &apos;s fourth down and long yardage ,  the two - minute warning sounded and the ball &apos;s deep in our territory !  how brilliant do you have to be ?  ! 
and she  -  -  the one you have chosen  -  -  she feels as much for you ? 
the three proved  -  after exhaustive efforts  -  incapable of rehabilitation .  now as you know ,  we had no death penalty  - 
and so our scientists constructed ,  from an irreversible mathematical equation ,  the phantom zone .  in it we imprisoned these three arch - villains for all eternity . 
delete in cutting
why ? 
wait ,  wait ,  wait just a moment .  wait till you &apos;ve got to know better will you please .   wait ,   -  -  look ,  i can give you anything you want .  i can give you the brass ring ,  the  -  er  -  -  unlimited freedom to maim ,  cure ,  destroy ,  chew  -  plus lex luthor &apos;s savvy .  lex luthor &apos;s career guidance .  .  .  lex luthor &apos;s school of .  .  . 
it must be tough ,  having to be clark kent . 
wait !  don &apos;t go in !  it &apos;s a trap ! 
no drinks  .  no movie .  this is the last time i take a charter flight . 
there will be no attack ?  no attempt to overpower the terrorists ? 
yes ,  but will you honor it ? 
then we must go there too .   to rule .  finally  -  to rule !   and then you shall have what you want . 
i &apos;ve never been in a place like this before . 
hello ,  lacy .  can anybody break a twenty ?  the cabbie didn &apos;t have any change . 
shouldn &apos;t you pay the cabbie ? 
you don &apos;t have to be polite ,  clark .  i &apos;ve got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me . 
any more like you back home ,  clark ? 
no paris ? 
boys ,  old lex has a secret recipe in this dish  .   .   .  call it a genetic stew .  you help me place it on one of your missiles and i promise you  .   .   .  if superman throws it into the sun ,  he &apos;ll get the biggest surprise of his life .  i &apos;ll be able to introduce superman to his first nightmare  .   .   .  a nuclear man ! 
impossible ?  why ? 
would you mind taking a walk with me ? 
awesome ! 
no ,  daddy .  our business is journalism .  we can &apos;t continue to be so irresponsible  .   .   .  or else we &apos;ll just lead everyone into a disaster . 
is he for real ? 
i know i &apos;m not exactly a girl scout but  .   .   .  maybe if i show him i &apos;m trying  .   .   .  he &apos;ll like me . 
i hadn &apos;t counted on this but  .   .   .    .   .   .  of course  -  the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat .  i am a  .  .  . 
look closely at his cell structure .  see anything familiar ? 
you &apos;d risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains . 
i &apos;ll deal with you later . 
i know ,  but   -  - 
ah !  the guest of honor at last !  and about time ,  too ! 
me ? 
a hot story ,  huh ? 
she &apos;s in california .  that &apos;s wild enough ,  i guess . 
don &apos;t worry ,  mom .  i know . 
i &apos;d like to . 
your bookie ? 
i know .  he sends a check every week to his dear gray - haired old mother . 
it isn &apos;t worth getting a heart attack over ,  lois . 
thanks ,  clark ,  but i &apos;m booked for the night . 
it &apos;s not what you think .  darn it .  i &apos;m going out on a story .  the secretary of defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid &apos;s going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he &apos;d rather duck . 
it wasn &apos;t a trick ! 
you &apos;re just jealous . 
your father was a sick weirdo . 
this ?  ? 
again ?  ?  ? 
nuts .  he made it . 
mr .  romance .  .  . 
tune me in  ,  lady .  an explosion such as the one superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the krypton rock . 
about vesuvius .  about superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano .   ahh ,  the look on his face when he saw that kryptonite .  when will i see another ,  y &apos;know ?  y &apos;know ? 
ready ? 
don &apos;t let me down . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
oh .  why ?  does he live up here ? 
i mean the other one ! 
well  -  gotta change that tire if were gonna get home . 
lois ,  the kickback story .  .  . 
do as i say .  let go ! 
wha &apos; .  .  . what are you doing here ? 
can you really see through anything ? 
do you like pink ? 
i .  .  . uh .  .  . 
now then ,  otis .  did you get what i asked for ? 
i gave him steady employment  -  - 
is that real enough for you ? 
i still don &apos;t get it . 
what is this ?  ?  ! 
it wouldn &apos;t hurt .  you can &apos;t go on living in fantasies .  did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb ?  and drop it ?   why ,  our strategic defense boys would have   -  - 
still ,  foolishly ,  perhaps ,  i had a theory that eliminates the presidential push - button .   i was doing my homework .  .  . 
luthor   -  - 
now who &apos;s the dreamer ,  superman ?  even you can &apos;t fly that fast ! 
yes ,  we do know each other .   i &apos;m alison jones . 
so there were others ? 
alison . 
say hi to zoe . 
are you sure ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
well ,  it being so depressing and all .   but it &apos;s reality .   you can &apos;t just turn this off because you happen to think it &apos;s a bad idea . 
nicole &apos;s coming over to look after the kids tonight .   she &apos;ll be there around six . 
have you been waiting long ? 
yes . 
i have to . 
because i have to . 
is it true that you gave nicole one of lydia &apos;s dresses ?   that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ? 
why did you do that ,  billy ? 
dolores .   no one calls me  &apos;mrs .  driscoll &apos; . 
no ,  nothing like that .   the ottos are what i &apos;d call model citizens .  they &apos;re regular at town meetings .  they give their opinions  in a respectful way .   they always help out at various fund - raising bazaars in town  ,  though they aren &apos;t church goers . 
what do you mean ? 
excuse me ? 
i could wrap it up .   protect the other kids . 
he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein .   it wasn &apos;t .   i feel like his monster . 
what happened to summer ? 
and winter ? 
how was it ? 
is he coming over now ?   right away ? 
hey ,  billy !   what brings you out on a night like this ?   c &apos;mon in .   take a load off . 
nicole ? 
why ? 
it was snowing . 
you always think you &apos;re prepared for these things . 
i &apos;m in a car wash . 
the problem is i have no idea who i &apos;m talking to right now . 
yes ,  i &apos;ll accept the charges . 
dolores ? 
been drinking since high school .  fucked himself up .   used to be smart enough . 
how does the family survive ? 
yes . 
this is before the accident ,  nicole .  do you understand what i &apos;m asking ? 
why were you scared ? 
you could see the speedometer ? 
did you say anything to mrs .  driscoll ? 
there wasn &apos;t time ? 
what do you remember about the accident ? 
how do you like it ,  nicole ? 
you &apos;re going to need special care for a long time to come .   it &apos;s not going to be easy .   not for you ,  not for any of us .   because we love you so much .   and it &apos;s going to cost money .   more than we can imagine . 
will the police do anything to her ? 
where are we running ?   what am i missing here ? 
hello ,  sidney .   wanna table ? 
i could think of better places to meet her ,  instead of here .   he lives on the whole top floor . 
went over to philly yesterday an &apos; seen the folks .  .  . it &apos;s nice you send them the fifty a month .  .  . 
thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow . 
 .  .  . people catch on quick to such an item .   van cleve already called me  -  he &apos;s firing the quintet . 
i hate j . j .   -  -  but not that much at this moment .  .  . 
blessings on thee ,  the both .  .  . well .  .  .  gotta run now .   see you two kids later ! 
take it easy ,  susie .   he wouldn &apos;t be much of a man if he didn &apos;t understand my concern .   would you ,  son ? 
but my day with susie isn &apos;t over yet and -  - 
err .  .  . the supreme court story ,  i was telling you  -  justice black . 
there is some allusion here that escapes me .  .  . 
spahish .  .  . that must show he likes  &quot; spigs &quot;  ,  too . 
i &apos;m a schoolboy  -  teach me ,  teach me . 
correct me if i &apos;m wrong ,  but i don &apos;t think so .  .  . 
no ,  lemme finish .   i don &apos;t like this job !   that boy is dumb only on matinee days  -  otherwise he &apos;s got a head .   and susan ,  like you said ,  she &apos;s growing up .   two heads .  what i mean ,  we got a slippery ,  dangerous problem here ! 
well ,  what have i got ?   alimony to a pair of tramps ?   they &apos;re of no concern to me .   it &apos;s you who count ,  but don &apos;t get me wrong  -  i don &apos;t intend to let you break your neck again ! 
what does that mean  -  integrity ? 
full of beans ,  ain &apos;t you ?   but you know that you &apos;ll stand or fall by what you &apos;re doing now .  .  . 
sidney ,  i told you  - 
who put this item in about the comic ?    &quot; if there &apos;s a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace ,  you &apos;ll have to pardon us for not catching the name .   we were too busy screaming .  &quot;  does this temple have a press agent ? 
what &apos;s your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates ? 
he was writing a special sunday piece on .  .  .  ? 
pay the rent .   let the tailor wait . 
i wish i could help in some way ,  sidney . 
so what &apos;ll you do if i feel nervous ?  you &apos;ll open your meaty ,  sympathetic arms .  .  .  ? 
you ought to be used to me by now . 
where &apos;s those glossy prints you promised ?   tonight &apos;s the latest i can place them  - 
and it would cost a pretty penny ,  huh ? 
i hope that j . j .  really likes steve ,  that it isn &apos;t an act . 
listen ,  get a good night &apos;s sleep  -  tomorrow &apos;s another day .   feeling sorry for yourself won &apos;t help . 
jimmy !   this is a coincidence .   i am just going  - 
i just didn &apos;t think that i could antagonize him ,  steve  -  -  for our sake ,  i mean . 
do you know about the chip ? 
we should abort . 
do you have bandages ? 
look ,  whatever you want me to do ,  i &apos;ll do .   i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up ,  okay ? 
holy shit .  .  .  you &apos;re really real !   i mean .  .  .  whoah !   you &apos;re ,  uh .  .  .  like a machine underneath ,  right .  .  .  but sort of alive outside ? 
yeah ?   who sent you ? 
so this other guy ?   he &apos;s a terminator too ,  right ,  like you ? 
can i stop by my house ? 
you sure ? 
typically ,  the subject being copied is terminated . 
jesus .  .  .  you were gonna kill that guy ! 
now remember ,  you &apos;re not gonna kill anyone ,  right ? 
excellent . 
you will . 
 &quot; no fate .  &quot;   no fate but what we make .   my father told her this .  .  .  i mean i made him memorize it ,  up in the future ,  as a message to her  -  -  never mind .   okay ,  the whole thing goes  &quot; the future is not set .   there is no fate but what we make for ourselves .  &quot; 
i guess ,  yeah  -  -   oh shit !  ! 
drive for a minute . 
we don &apos;t have much time . 
no shit ? 
mom ?   you okay ? 
i know ! 
it has helped me a lot to have a goal ,  something to look forward to . 
because skynet knows the russian counter - strike will remove its enemies here . 
it &apos;s finally over . 
it &apos;s not just a dream .   it &apos;s real ,  you moron !  i know the date is happens !  ! 
and talking is talking !  well ,  i think we better get on . 
don &apos;t see me to my door ,  there &apos;s no need . 
where you from ,  david ? 
so what is it ? 
when you question him again ,  could you treat him with more respect ? 
so ,  major ,  tell me ,  have you questioned dr .  furtwngler ? 
yeah ,  yeah ,  art and politics ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  i heard all about that . 
this is what i &apos;m saying .  he must have had party contacts . 
and suddenly ,  steve ,  suddenly you notice that they like you .  they honour you ,  suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world ,  for example . 
major ,  major .  .  .  he &apos;s here  .  .  . 
what they do in austria doesn &apos;t interest me one little bit .  okay ?  i have your questionnaire here ,   gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwngler ,  born berlin ,  january 1886 .  orchestral conductor .  and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party . 
your guess is as good as mine . 
i &apos;ve got to hand it to the british ,  david .  you know what those guys are ?   decent .   tell me ,  herr dr .  furtwngler ,  do you know hans hinkel ? 
who ? 
what did goering say ? 
if it &apos;s too hot ,  open your tie . 
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about . 
you won &apos;t find it because no such telegram exists . 
have no idea what ordinary people thought . 
everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews .  but -  -   i have things here you said and wrote .  listen to this :   &apos;the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international .  &apos; and what about this :   &apos;jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music .  &apos;  &apos;jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples ,  lacking roots .  &apos; you deny you said these things ? 
was a member of .  .  .  ?   speak up ? 
furtwngler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday . 
one of your people told me . 
there &apos;s a rumour .  .  .  i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s true or not .  .  .  but ask him about von der null . 
and ask him about his private life . 
here you go .   you &apos;re a bob &apos;s girl now .   nancy will check you out . 
you can &apos;t to that .  .  . 
great . 
that bum .   so what if he has a porsche ,  he can &apos;t treat you like that .  .  . it &apos;s friday night for crissakes . 
i haven &apos;t seen you in here lately ,  mr .  miller . 
but outside ,  it &apos;s living human tissue .   flesh ,  skin ,  hair .  .  . blood .   grown for the cyborgs . 
so ,  it &apos;s from the future ,  is that right ? 
whatever .  .  . they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build el computer grande .  .  . skynet .  .  . for the government .   right ? 
is this enough ? 
he &apos;ll find us ,  won &apos;t he ? 
don &apos;t say that . 
i don &apos;t think i like this . 
so .   you &apos;re a soldier .  fighting for whom ? 
i can help you .  .  . 
sarah .   sarah ,  this is dr .  silber -  man .   i &apos;d like you to tell him everything reese said to you .   do you feel up to it ? 
why don &apos;t you just stretch out here and get some sleep .   it &apos;ll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands . 
you &apos;re talking tomorrow .   today is what counts . 
oh ,  god .  .  .   ! 
this can &apos;t be real .  .  . 
 &quot;  .  .  .  wait for help .  &quot;   wait for help .  i &apos;m not opening a door that specifically warns me not to . 
this is c . r . s . 
i think i would remember .   what makes you think it &apos;s me ? 
you can talk while i drive us to the police . 
then ,  what good are you ? 
what ? 
who is it ? 
it could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank . 
they won &apos;t .  .  . 
where &apos;d you get that .  .  .   ? 
what did you really see< / u> ?   this whole time .  .  .  special effects ,  squibs ,  like in the movies .   please ,  you &apos;ve got to believe me .  .  .   he &apos;s got a gun ,  with real bullets ! 
nicholas .  .  . 
no !   you take another step ,  i &apos;ll shoot !   they &apos;re trying to kill me .  .  . 
it is .   it &apos;s what you hired us for .  nobody touched your money .   nobody stole anything .   they &apos;re waiting on the other side of that door with champagne .  .  .  all your friends .  .  .  it &apos;s a celebration .  .  . 
i have to get to the airport .  .  . 
i redecorated .   what about you ? 
call that number . 
yeah ,  almost .  .  . 
slow down ,  take a breath .  .  . 
how do you know ? 
how did those .  .  .   ? 
no !   you &apos;re one of them .   of course ,  it makes perfect sense ! 
really ? 
where &apos;s christine ?   the waitress . 
yes . 
it &apos;s just a t . v .   he &apos;s just an actor . 
i don &apos;t write the questions .   i just review them . 
tailored specifically to each participant .   think of it as a great vacation ,  except you don &apos;t go to it ,  it comes to you . 
sorry to keep you waiting . 
one guarantee .   payment &apos;s entirely at your brother &apos;s discretion and ,  as a gift ,  dependent on your satisfaction . 
you did ?   how is he ? 
is everything alright ? 
what &apos;s the trouble ? 
what &apos;s this about ? 
invitations :  the museum gala . 
and this is my assistant ,  mary lambretta . 
so why did you need the addam &apos;s family mansion for a scientific test ? 
i didn &apos;t do it . 
nell ! 
no ,  malcolm !   individual performance is only part of it .   i know why baseball players choke for no reason ,  i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert ,  and need to ,  to give a great performance ,  but what i want to know is ,  how fear works in a group .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know . 
what is that tune ? 
why would we want to do that ,  nell ? 
what &apos;ll happen to us ,  nell ? 
he &apos;s wandering around the house ,  and nell heard him .   she thought it was ghosts .   let &apos;s go look for him again . 
what do you want ? 
it &apos;s a job .   i keep banker &apos;s hours .   i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six .   you can serve yourselves .   breakfast is ready at nine .   i don &apos;t wait on people .   i don &apos;t stay after dinner .   not after it begins to get dark .   i leave before dark comes .   we live in town .   nine miles .   so there won &apos;t be anyone around if you need help .   we couldn &apos;t even hear you ,  in the night . 
you &apos;ve been out of the world for a long time ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
well ,  it wasn &apos;t me .   mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he &apos;s in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and .  .  .   you said the good doctor was with you . 
then who is ?   come on ,  nell .   deep down ,  if you really thought it wasn &apos;t jim ,  why wouldn &apos;t you be leaving right this second ?   why wouldn &apos;t you be afraid ?   really afraid . 
is it possible that you &apos;re too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty ? 
i &apos;m so glad we &apos;re having this chat . 
i &apos;m not into finger foods .   too fussy . 
the freeway &apos;s faster ,  but lacks a certain majesty . 
we think someone is here . 
how they goin &apos; ,  kid ? 
how &apos;d you like to kill someone for me ? 
what . 
what kind ? 
as it happens .   i didn &apos;t make that part up . 
valentine .   what &apos;s he got to say for himself ? 
coulda happened to anyone ,  man .   i never knew her to be reckless .   i mean ,  sure ,  she would smoke a little grass ,  or something ,  have a few drinks .   but that &apos;s it ,  nothing more than that . 
she didn &apos;t know what to say .   i thought someone should say something .  to someone .   with me it was ,  i don &apos;t know  -  -  jenny liked me for some reason .   i felt like i owed her . 
i already told you ,  man .   corcoran .   know what that is ?   state prison . 
you &apos;re kiddin &apos; me ,  right ? 
he came in with jenny to the restaurant where i work .   that &apos;s not where they met . 
has he ? 
that was one of them ? 
bring the motor around .   bang out in front ,  right ? 
steady on . 
i &apos;ve been wondering something . 
do you have any friends ,  man ? 
not no more ,  they ain &apos;t .   i quit that acting shit ,  man . 
hey ,  elaine .   you even know what he &apos;s saying half the time ? 
perhaps it was the smoke . 
 .  .  .  no ,  i went in for more improving pastimes .   philosophy classes ,  language courses ,  european history ,  all that lark .  did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in people &apos;s houses than there were people in people &apos;s houses . 
here ,  are you always this sarky ? 
said it went on for donkey &apos;s years . 
ashamed . 
were you still married at the time  -  -  to jenny &apos;s mother ,  i mean ? 
what line is he in . 
i see . 
you fuckin &apos; guys and your dicks . 
on what .   what makes you so certain . 
you don &apos;t seem bothered . 
only in the movies . 
last time might as well &apos;ve been the first .   i remember all the times ,  don &apos;t i .   watching her grow up  -  -   in increments . 
well ,  she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn &apos;t in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago in a worldwide tour of othello . 
she used to tell me she &apos;d turn me in .   little kid .   ten year old .    &quot; if you &apos;re naughty ,  dad ,  i &apos;ll tell on ya .  &quot;   she didn &apos;t want me sent down again ,  see .  when i was planning some job .    &quot; i &apos;ll tell  &apos;em ,  dad ,  i promise i will .   here ,  look ,  i &apos;m calling the old bill right now &quot;   -  -  picking up the telephone .   i can see her ,  the phone in her hand .   became a sort of joke between us .   only it wasn &apos;t a joke . 
how far ? 
that &apos;s where valentine &apos;s scarpered . 
there &apos;s one thing i don &apos;t understand .   the thing i don &apos;t understand  .  .  .  is every motherfucking thing you &apos;re saying . 
of the deal ,  man . 
but if you &apos;re mad at him too and he &apos;s mad at you  .  .  .  that must make us pals . 
in which case i &apos;ll just do what i usually do . 
yeah ,  that &apos;s right . 
maybe she doesn &apos;t even know the english guy . 
there is ? 
what ? 
how we gonna get that lucky ? 
where &apos;s  .  .  .  what &apos;s - his - name  -  -  fred  -  - 
pleasure . 
emi in london .   i work with ian . 
hello ,  rachel . 
but more or less . 
it &apos;s called dry cleaning .  you heard me right ,  brother ,   &apos;dry cleaning &apos; -  -  wash without water ,  no suds ,  no tumble ,  no stress on the clothes .  it &apos;s all done with chemicals ,  friend ,  and your garments end up crisp and fresh .  and here &apos;s the capper :  no shrinkage . 
you got the dough ?  ! 
come in ,  come in ,  siddown over there .  coffee ? 
 .  .  . usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft .  but cash -  - that &apos;s fine -  - it &apos;s all the same in the end -  -  dough &apos;s dough ,  huh ? 
uh - huh . 
 .  .  . dave ? 
i &apos;d understand if you &apos;d walked in here .  socked me in the nose .  whatever .  i deserved it . 
rye . 
 .  .  . you &apos;ve gotta give me something to work with .  freddy riedenschneider is good ,  but he &apos;s not a magician .  he can &apos;t just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize .  look .  look at what the other side is gonna run at us .  they got the company books ,  prepared by you -  - *cooked* by you -  - that &apos;s motive .  they got a murder scene *you* had access to .  that &apos;s opportunity .  they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with -  - a *dame &apos;s* weapon -  - 
ok ,  how did you know ? 
will anyone say they saw you there ?  on your way there ?  in there ?  on your was back ? 
 .  .  . i gotta hand it to him ,  he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes .  he talked about how i &apos;d lost my place in the universe .  .  . 
 .  .  . how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d . a .  made me out to be ,  how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel ,  and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn &apos;t had a chance to trot out for doris .  .  . 
no thanks . 
 &apos;scuse me ,  just finished dinner .  um .  frankly ,  doris &apos;d be better off with the county defender . 
 .  .  . huh ? 
 .  .  . i &apos;m rachel abundas .  everyone calls me birdy . 
jesus .  .  . 
sportsmanship !  that &apos;s my point .  june fly ,  ed ?  mosquito ?  which of these ?  well ,  what fish do you seek ? 
this hair . 
 .  .  . how you today ,  ed ? 
you don &apos;t got a headache ? 
as soon as the doctor lets us ,  we gotta move you .  does he understand that ?  we &apos;re supposed to tell him .  are you conscious ? 
there &apos;s some kind of animal loose in the museum .   pendergast &apos;s alone .   he needs help .   i want volunteers to go with me . 
for chrissake ,  i &apos;ll do it .   what &apos;s the combination ?  ! 
in every exhibition room .   the museum &apos;s divided into five cells .  the reception and exhibit are in cell five .   we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four ,  then seal the perimeter with our fire doors . 
i think i should come with you . 
dear god .   where are we ,  lieutenant ? 
yes .   bit of a shock .   but as cuthbert so tactfully put it ,  the museum needs new blood .   and since i &apos;ve been here since the mesozoic era  -  - 
this isn &apos;t a death sentence .   greg has promised to teach me fly fishing .   i &apos;ll garden .   i &apos;ll write . 
that cuthbert .   what a piece of work .  someone &apos;s dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit . 
like the claw . 
are there any hidden rooms or staircases ?   places where someone could hide ? 
we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate . 
dr .  frock ,  i was wondering .   what happened to the rest of whittlesley &apos;s plants ? 
they were yellow ! 
argo !   hobbes ! 
what kind of egg is it ? 
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim &apos;s brains ! 
yes .   he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect .  it held that evolution wasn &apos;t always gradual or driven by natural selection .   the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a  &quot; monster species &quot;  .   it made no sense .  but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster ,  living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years . 
no .   i &apos;m all right .   i won &apos;t let this affect me anymore .   john wouldn &apos;t get help .   his ego endangered the lives of others .   his theory came first . 
where would we find it ? 
genetic damage ? 
is there another way around ? 
what happened ? 
i &apos;m sorry .   i don &apos;t have anything for at least a month . 
i understand he &apos;s hardly had a life of his own since he left the show .   how did you convince him -  - was it the opportunity to be close to truman again ? 
we &apos;ve become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions ,  bored with pyrotechnics and special effects .   while the world he inhabits is counterfeit ,  there &apos;s nothing fake about truman himself .   no scripts ,  no cue cards .   it &apos;s not always shakespeare but it &apos;s genuine .   that &apos;s how he can support an entire channel . 
we should remind viewers that truman ,  especially as a child ,  presented a challenge for the production . 
in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies  -  the casting of a show determined by an air date  -  he was the one who arrived on cue . 
yes ,  everything you see on the show is for sale  -  from the actors &apos; wardrobe ,  food products ,  to the very homes they live in -  - 
lauren ,  right ? 
it &apos;s okay .   i probably wouldn &apos;t talk to me either . 
it &apos;s beautiful !   what are you waiting for ? 
i figured ,  what &apos;s the point ?   i knew i &apos;d just be taking my problems with me .   once the kids came along ,  it made me look at seahaven with new eyes .   i realized ,  what the hell could be better than this ?   i &apos;m telling you .   what you really need is someone to carry on the  &quot; burbank &quot;  name . 
i &apos;m onto something ,  marlon  -  something big . 
there &apos;s no point in trying to explain it ,  but a lot of strange things have been happening  -  elevators that don &apos;t go anywhere ,  people talking about me on the radio ,  you know what i mean ? 
i went all over but i never found a place like this .   look at that sunset ,  truman .   it &apos;s perfect . 
stay where you are ! 
i don &apos;t know what to think ,  marlon .  maybe i &apos;m going out of my mind ,  but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow . 
 .  .  . personally i think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling .  .  . of course it &apos;s a 20 , 000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before ?  .  .  . naturally ,  i intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick .  .  . risks ? < / i> .  .  .    .  .  . sure i &apos;m aware of the risks -  - why else do you think i would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company .  .  .  ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
well ,  what do you think ? 
i was hoping we could have a special evening . 
every time you and marlon -  - 
and then what ,  truman ?   we &apos;d be back to where we were five years ago .   you &apos;re talking like a teenager . 
i know . 
what did you want ? 
where shall we go ?   where shall we go ?  spontaneity is what it &apos;s all about .  forget fiji .   we can &apos;t very well drive to fiji ,  can we ?   what about atlantic city ? 
that &apos;s right .   i do ,  don &apos;t i ? 
let me out ,  truman .   you &apos;re not right in the head .   you want to destroy yourself ,  you do it on your own ! 
truman ,  i took the  &quot; hypocrite &quot;  oath ! 
stop this now .   i &apos;ll do it .   i swear . 
how are you ,  mother ? 
it doesn &apos;t sound insane ,  truman .   i swear i see him ten times a week -  - in a hundred faces .   i almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last thursday . 
about time they started cleaning up the trash downtown .   we don &apos;t want to end up like the rest of the country . 
 -  - darling -  - 
special agent scully  -  - 
you &apos;ve been back to dallas ? 
i hope to .  we &apos;re working to develop this evidence  -  - 
do they know ? 
is this dr .  kurtzweil &apos;s residence ? 
you follow me out here for a reason ? 
he just let it explode . 
i &apos;ll know soon enough . 
a plague ? 
 -  -  you saw this experiment ? 
you didn &apos;t know my father  -  - 
no .  i haven &apos;t . 
alright .  .  .  what &apos;ll it be :  coke ,  pepsi ?  a saline iv ? 
 .  .  . thirteen fifty six .  .  . 
this isn &apos;t about you ,  scully .  they &apos;re doing this to me . 
i wake you ? 
and there &apos;s been no autopsy performed .  there &apos;s no y incision here; no internal exam . 
and you &apos;ve never seen anything like that ? 
what ? 
we &apos;re not chasing trucks ,  we &apos;re chasing evidence  -  - 
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off ,  to hide something :  bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself . 
yeah ,  well they may this one . 
been where ? 
cool in here .  temperature &apos;s being regulated . 
what are you doing ? 
you &apos;re on the verge ,  mulder  -  -  please don &apos;t do this to me  -  - 
i &apos;m contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers  -  - 
scully .  .  . 
cold .  .  . 
on whose orders ? 
i &apos;m quite prepared to tell you everything ,  though there isn &apos;t much you haven &apos;t guessed . 
let me out .  stop the car . 
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus .  its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we &apos;ve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years .   or it may not . 
don &apos;t bring it home in this . 
the first .  .  .  what ?   six or seven times i went in .    remember what happened ? 
i &apos;ll come by tomorrow after work .   with dinner . 
i still don &apos;t understand why i can &apos;t do this .  .  .  this isn &apos;t some  &quot; troubled kid &quot;  you &apos;re dealing with . 
this man is deeply disturbed ,  he .  .  . 
why &apos;d you bring him here ? 
this is stargher we &apos;re talking about ? 
remember ,  julia hickson is priority number one .   nothing else matters .   find out where she is . 
oh no .  .  .  no you don &apos;t . 
what about the legalities of this .  .  .  ? 
i have to ask you some things .  .  .  are you taking any prescription drugs ? 
i know your partner &apos;s here ,  but it &apos;s very important that you &apos;re honest . 
you &apos;re looking well . 
that &apos;s a secret . 
how &apos;s the patient . 
how is she ? 
we &apos;ll go back to his house ,  pete .  there &apos;s still a lot to do .   analyze the videos ,  track sales of the bleach ,  go through his records .   maybe he owns property somewhere . 
why jeopardize what we &apos;ve already done ?  we caught the sonofabitch .   carl stargher .   that &apos;s going to be like bundy ,  gacy ,  dahmer .   a case that makes careers .   but if we push our luck .   if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it . 
jesus christ ,  man ,  you look like hell . 
ich weiss nicht . 
thank you . 
you were awfully good . 
no . 
don &apos;t understand what harry saw in a fellow like that . 
who are you looking for now ? 
can i hear you ? 
when .  .  . what did you do ? 
oh ,  that was many years ago . 
seemed like a good idea . 
well ,  i didn &apos;t learn that from him . 
holly . 
i thought you were going to go away .  aren &apos;t the police after you ? 
 .  .  . is there ? 
nichts danke .  kein . 
 .  .  . parents . 
do you know this man ? 
did you ever hear of  &quot; the lone rider of santa fe ?  &quot; 
tactful too ,  aren &apos;t we ,  callaghan ? 
do you see what that means ? 
next ,  paine . 
this is where he vanished . 
didn &apos;t i ? 
calloway ,  can &apos;t you do something about anna ? 
be sensible ,  martins . 
shall i go over there ,  sir ? 
get me major callaghan on the phone . 
you do ! 
i was going to stay with him ,  but he died thursday . 
oh ,  mr .  martins ,  good evening . 
hello  -  mr .  martins ,  we tried to get you at your hotel .  we have arranged that lecture for tomorrow . 
unwise ,  holly .  .  . 
 .  .  . you . 
dr .  winkel ? 
martins . 
speak english ? 
 .  .  . give evidence . 
you don &apos;t know it was an accident .  you only saw a dead man and three men carry him . 
i thought there was something funny about the whole thing . 
that &apos;s all you meant ? 
passport ,  please . 
why not ?  thai girls best in the world .  thai food best in the world .  thai dope best in the world . 
the noise ?  don &apos;t worry .  you &apos;re on holiday . 
oh ,  that noise !  yes ,  he certainly did . 
it &apos;s arranged .  tomorrow morning .  eight hundred bath . 
yes ,  of course i can swim .  how far do you think it is ? 
richard  -  i saw a fin ! 
he tried to borrow money from us . 
you realize that in the eternity of space ,  there is a planet ,  just like this one ,  where you are photographing back towards us .  you &apos;re photographing yourself . 
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them . 
do you know the kentucky friend mouse story ?  &quot; 
they &apos;re racist ,  they &apos;re militaristic ,  they act like bullyboys in the territories .  .  .  . 
 .  .  . so she takes the pants in back  -  -  where they try them on ?  and i think fuck it .  .  .  . 
you write that ?   come work for me .  you &apos;ve got a lot to learn; i can teach it to you . 
the point is ,  the modern world is a jewish disease . 
which is what ? 
is he a nazi ? 
va - yomer adonai el avram :  lech lecha mayartzcha oo - mimohlad - tcha oo - m &apos;bayt avaycha el ha - ertez asher arecha .  .  . 
know your enemy .  .  .  .   &apos;cause it &apos;s a basic text of western culture .  i want to read it in the original .  okay ? 
they think it &apos;s the word of god ,  and it &apos;s holy ,  and the flesh isn &apos;t .  .  .  . 
what &apos;s it about ? 
you &apos;re learning the hebrew really fast . 
carla ?  .  .  .  it &apos;s me ,  danny .  .  . danny balint .  .  .  ?  we met at that .  .  .  &#93 meeting at your house . ]
i didn &apos;t notice his shoes .  .  .  .  did your mother know he was there ? 
why are you taking that ? 
yes ,  of course .  but that only plays in this room ,  with people who aren &apos;t embarrassed to call themselves nazis .  if you want a modern fascism ,  you don &apos;t mention jews . 
is it okay if i record this ? 
the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease .  could you elaborate on that ? 
what ?  excuse me ?  .  .  .   you &apos;re kidding ,  right ? 
you believe that ?  and you call yourself a reporter ? 
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally .  last week you went to a torah study group . 
without blood  -  -  a willingness to spill it  -  -  there &apos;s no real power ,  no authority . 
what about chicken ? 
he &apos;s going to die .   he won &apos;t take his medicine .  he eats dairy .  he probably still smokes when i &apos;m not around .   i asked him to come live with us .  alex offered to share his room ,  unsolicited .  .  .  .  but he didn &apos;t want to be any trouble . 
tell it to hitler . 
the polacks ?  from sacred heart ? 
which was his room ? 
i &apos;m in the rabbinic program at jts .  .  . 
where do you think you &apos;re going ? 
we redesigned the timing mechanism .  it can &apos;t possibly malfunction . 
 .  .  . may you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming .  .  .  . 
you &apos;re going to live here permanently ? 
this is good work .  .  .  unfortunately it &apos;s incomplete .   could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street . 
listen ,  i just found out we &apos;ve got real problems in sicily ! 
no ! 
i thought it was spanish that you spoke ? 
yes .   of course .   very wise . 
i tell you she &apos;s mine ! 
i might have known .   as i was telling you earlier ,  i &apos;m the world champion free diver . 
you forgot the hula ! 
and just where are you from ? 
how did it happen ? 
plenty of women everywhere right ? 
and .  .  .  does the voice come back ? 
well ,  if it isn &apos;t the little frenchman !   how is the little frenchman ? 
i remember .   hi roberto ! 
i don &apos;t have one . 
well ,  what are they ? 
it &apos;s okay . 
c &apos;mon ,  you two .  .  .  jacques ,  we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight .   we have a new world champion . 
no . 
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it ! 
tell me ,  why don &apos;t you go and get your medal ? 
hey !   will you slow down !   when did you learn how to drive ? 
good night . 
i give you this .   you &apos;re stubborn .  .  .  dumb ,  but stubborn . 
enzo ,  enzo !   congratulations ! 
you &apos;re going to be very busy these days aren &apos;t you ? 
uncle louis ! 
i changed the lock you son of a bitch ! 
how was your trip ? 
 .  .  .  and if we repaint the walls ,  we &apos;ll need new curtains ,  you put the painters on you visa and i &apos;ll do the curtains on american express .  .  .  for the couch there &apos;s bloomingdales .  .  .   or are you still over your limit ? 
what is it honey .  .  .  the frenchy ? 
alright mordechai ,  now that we &apos;re alone i just want to say that i &apos;m not happy about this .  i don &apos;t want a repeat of that incident in the west bank . 
you like my mordechai ,  yes ? 
hanukkah ,  shmanukkah .  it isn &apos;t even one of the high holidays .  what concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty ,  and has yet to settle down with a nice jewish girl .   i &apos;ll make you a deal .  i &apos;ll help you with your little hanukkah problem if you help me with my mordechai . 
what are we going to do ?  we &apos;re at least an hour from the front . 
so ,  now what ? 
mordechai ? 
listen cat ,  i &apos;ll have you know that i hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player . 
let me guess ,  you &apos;re the goy who stole hanukkah . 
what &apos;s going on ?  why &apos;d he stop ? 
this is for  &quot; mama and the kids .  &quot; 
oh ,  i &apos;m only exploring your theory .  let &apos;s take a step further .  you drink ,  don &apos;t you ,  charlie ? 
that cat ain &apos;t mean .  i feed him out of my own hand for six years .  why don &apos;t he kill me ?  at night in the truck ,  i let him out of the cage .  when i am falling asleep i hear him walking back and forth .  i go to sleep .  he don &apos;t hurt me . 
charlie wasn &apos;t drunk last night . 
i &apos;m sick . 
well  -  -  did he give you a lot of money ? 
cut . 
don &apos;t look at it ! 
pedro is waiting for me ,  too . 
show business ? 
but it doesn &apos;t eat what it kills . 
charlie and i were talking .  that &apos;s one reason i wanted to see you . 
it could be a man . 
yes ,  but what sort of a man ? 
come on ,  charlie .  let &apos;s go find another and better suspect . 
yes .  there have been men who kill for pleasure  -  -  strange pleasure .  there was blue beard in france  -  -  jack the ripper in london .  it &apos;s not uncommon . 
to the eye ?  like other men . 
jerry told me you were an expert with animals ,  mr .  galbraith .  couldn &apos;t you tell where it went ? 
that was unfortunate . 
wait 
i &apos;ve been trying to tell him ,  sheriff .  he won &apos;t listen to me . 
yes .  the lipstick . 
chief ,  don &apos;t you understand what this means ? 
makes no difference .  get him out ! 
you &apos;re too good to me . 
you &apos;re too good to me . 
well ,  does everybody love us now ?  you &apos;ve been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors ! 
i &apos;m glad you care about us ,  kicks .  sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket  -  - 
kiki  -  -  it wasn &apos;t the leopard . 
i  -  -  i bought some silver jewelry and stuff from eloise  -  - 
all right ,  i &apos;m not ashamed of it !  i split it two ways 
thats right . 
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard ,  eh ?   her brothers death . 
i found this at your brothers . 
your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place ,  mrs de moraes .  and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise .   you dont mess around with child procurers .  right now my guess is hes either on the run ,  held captive ,  or dead .   i understand your misgivings ,  mrs de moraes .  but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from .  if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man .  which leads me to why im here at such a late hour .  i need 20 , 000 ,  in cash ,  by 11 this morning . 
i will of course do my best to hang onto it . 
im impressed .  that information could have cost me 20 , 000 . 
just a moment .  .  .   go ahead . 
not yet .  the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address .  ill give it 24 hours .  he just might show up .   if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont .  paul lamont ,  all right ? 
mr lombard .  mrs de moraes .  .  . 
one just doesnt .  .  .  tell me ,  what does one speak about ,  huh ? 
what happened ?  adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice ? 
well ,  i hope you enjoyed yourself . 
do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother ? 
crow what ? 
is this some kind of sick stunt ?  let me guess .   you want money ,  right ? 
where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there ? 
you know where to look for your austrian ,  right ? 
thank you for the guided tour ,  but would you mind telling me what were doing here ? 
right .  .  .  well ,  ill get your money first thing in the morning ,  okay ?   okay .  goodnight then . 
hi .  .  . 
look at him ,  whitney .  come all the way from england to clean up california .  huh ! 
pups .  bitches .  from three to twelve months .   trained and untrained ones .  white and brown ones .  you understand ? 
so ,  what are you looking for ? 
whos the money man ? 
what company ? 
where is it ? 
hello again ,  neighbour .  i didnt intrude ,  did i ? 
ive got work tonight ,  jane . 
hello there .  hows the flat .  i cleaned .  .  . 
carlos de moraes ? 
i didnt mean to imply you did ,  mrs spitz . 
am i supposed to know him ? 
only feeding the disease ,  eh ,  martin ? 
trying to say something ,  martin ? 
your lady friend did . 
will you be alone ?   the merchandise .  is it just you or .  .  . 
this is private property .  the public footpath is back to the left of the bridge . 
no !  what do you want here ?  how do you know me ? 
what are you going to do now ?  call the police ?   take him away ?  i must warn you hes terrified of men ,  so .  .  . 
thats what he said .  i tried to dissuade him .  .  .  told him i couldnt take on another child ,  that hed get into trouble .  .  .  i mean ,  people who sell children .  .  .  but he wasnt listening .  .  .  i guess he finally found himself a crusade .  .  .  his family think hes back on drugs ,  eh ?   huh .  .  .  leon did drugs .  a lot of drugs .  went through his self - destruct phase ,  you know ?   things to come to terms with .  demons to fight .  .  .  some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated .  not leons .  he did beat the drug ,  though .  he did . 
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun .  if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did . 
fine .  .  . 
now ,  can you stand up ?   can you use your legs and stand up ? 
whats an hour of your time worth these days ,  nathalie ?   combien ,  nathalie ! 
moreau ?  cest moi .  alors .  .  . 
why ,  are you not ready to die for your king ? 
jean ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  it &apos;s not so easy .  .  . 
i would like some fresh straw . 
yes .   i didn &apos;t confess today . 
i shall also be needing a war horse  -  -  mine is too slow  -  -  and armor  -  -  and a good sword  -  -  and an artist to make me a banner . 
i thought you were an archer ? 
jeanne ,  stop it ! 
not so .  .  .  easily .   why aren &apos;t you .  .  .  fighting .  .  .  ?   go on .  .  .  we &apos;re almost there .  .  . 
the king said you &apos;re his finest archer .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;ll go . 
it &apos;s not time yet .   my mission is not over yet .   there is still more i must do before i can really  -  -  finally  -  -  go home . 
did you come back to marry me or to insult me ? 
i am ready now .  .  . 
one day you will . 
 .  .  .  and maybe the king will give you some money ,  and a little land ,  and a title even .  .  .    .  .  .  wouldn &apos;t that be a fine thing ?  you ,  a lady of title ! 
but that was her order ! 
is it true that you launched an attack on paris ? 
i can &apos;t read . 
which did you prefer ,  your banner or your sword ? 
and ? 
why ? 
yes ,  but .  .  . 
yes ,  maybe .  .  .  i don &apos;t remember .  .  . 
arrest them ! 
who &apos;s running this trial ,  you or her ?   i can &apos;t believe it !   this wretched girl  -  -  how dare she speak to us like that ? 
i understand your impatience ,  but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and .  .  . 
so .  .  .  here is the famous jeanne .  .  .  savior of orleans .  .  .  terror of the english ?   you look pretty ordinary to me .  .  . 
are you alright ?   did they hurt you ? 
jeanne ,  listen to me very carefully .  we are all men of faith ,  and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own .   we do so in the name of our holy mother church ,  who never closes her arms to those who would return to her .   but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority .   take heed of this charitable admonition ,  for if you persist in refusing our help ,  then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers ,  and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you .   so now .  .  .  will you please recite our lord &apos;s prayer ? 
what were you doing when the voice came ? 
i know ,  jeanne .  .  .  it was the only way to save you from the fire ! 
there &apos;s no need to be afraid ,  sire . 
what was my mission ?   to help my country ?   but how could i do that ?  i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war .  .  .  so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it . 
ah ,  jeanne .  .  .  come here .  .  .  !   this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco .  .  .  nothing is ready .  .  . 
why did you betray me ?   paris was ours for the taking !   all i needed was another few hundred men .  .  .  why did you take back the army you gave me ? 
supposing she &apos;s an assassin ? 
my captains have sworn their support . 
when you saw your king for the first time ,  was there an angel over his head ? 
does he have hair ? 
because .  .  .  because  -  -  i mean  -  -  the english have a broad sense of humor ,  but .  .  .  i mean ,  you don &apos;t understand .  .  .  to them you &apos;re a witch ,  working for the devil .   what makes you think they &apos;ll listen to you ? 
the dauphin  -  -  he &apos;s sending us food  -  -  and supplies  -  -  and an army  -  -  led by jeanne  -  -  the maiden from lorraine  -  -  isn &apos;t it wonderful ?  ! 
this is no good ! 
do you know how to count ? 
jeanne .  .  .  that is not ten thousand reinforcements  -  -  that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers . 
but will you also submit to the decision of the church ? 
take mine instead  -  -  here  -  -  smash mine first ! 
who .  .  .  who are you .  .  .  ? 
i .  .  .  i &apos;m leaving .  .  .  i can &apos;t take anymore .  .  . 
why were you yelling like that ?  ! 
no ,  no ,  you did fine .   i &apos;d even say well done .   besides ,  most of the ones you killed probably deserved it ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
 &quot; love your enemies &quot;  .  .  . 
yes i am . 
you know i &apos;m always happy to see you ,  jeanne ,  but to keep coming here twice ,  three times a day .  .  . 
but you already confessed this morning .  .  . 
and what about your other friends .  .  .  you don &apos;t like playing with them ? 
he says .  .  .  he says i must be good .  .  .  and help everyone .  .  .  and take care of myself .   do you think he &apos;s coming from the sky ? 
i don &apos;t want to wait for his call . 
a beauty .  who is she ? 
i &apos;ll get dr luczak ,  we can trust him . 
i &apos;ve been in hiding .  i need somewhere to stay . 
how long have you been married ? 
will i still be able to play ? 
get your things together ,  you have to leave ! 
what &apos;s happened ? 
wish i knew you better . 
but .  .  . they won &apos;t get all of us .  .  .  we &apos;ll .  .  . it &apos;s too small .  .  . there &apos;s four hundred thousand of us in warsaw ! 
that &apos;s better than yesterday . 
very appropriate . 
wladek ,  stop that .  it &apos;s over now .  just be proud it happened .  my god ,  did they put up a fight . 
ah ,  here .  today &apos;s news from the other side . 
i have to say you look terrible .  what &apos;s the trouble ? 
i &apos;m not ,  but majorek is . 
pig ! 
if i play like an angel ,  why don &apos;t you listen ? 
what &apos;s happening ? 
i &apos;ll play the piano again .  on polish radio . 
what would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano ? 
he is quite altered ,  as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him .  well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone . 
which mountains are those dear ? 
no ,  words .  you have never heard words ? 
you have to wash them . 
what did she say ? 
and when is the next lesson ? 
all right if i look around your lobby ? 
nobody .   i just know what kinda women he likes .   i &apos;m gonna check all the joyhouses till i find him . 
these guys have gotta be the quill ,  duky .   we can &apos;t afford to rank the joint . 
twist ,  you know this guy ? 
okay ,  twist ,  but you know if this blows up ,  i can &apos;t do ya no good downtown .   gondorff is federal . 
i &apos;m gettin &apos; too slow for this racket .   i done the best i &apos;m gonna do .   you hang on too long ,  you start embarrassin &apos; yourself . 
and tell cole i wanta see him when he gets in . 
hey ,  luther told me he was carrying a wad ,  but i didn &apos;t figure this much . 
doyle ,  can i see you a minute ? 
it &apos;s important .   we had a little trouble in chicago today .   one of our runners got hit for 12 grand . 
mottola . 
i don &apos;t care .   load me a deck .   set it up for threes and nines .   i &apos;ll cut it in on his deal . 
turn the goddamn thing off ,  will ya . 
luther didn &apos;t tell me you had a big mouth . 
how &apos;d ya do ? 
everything go all right ? 
you know ,  somebody tailin &apos; ya .   a torpedo or somethin &apos; . 
you beat him ,  kid . 
you wanta wait for your share ? 
the porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars .   $100 minimum ,  straight poker .   last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left new york . 
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza .   i got you one of each .   he likes to cold deck low ,  8 &apos;s or 9 &apos;s . 
yeh ,  that &apos;d be real nice of ya ,  mr .  lonneman . 
raise 1 , 000 . 
see and raise 1 , 000 . 
never get enough ,  huh pal ?   i &apos;d think you &apos;d get tired of losin &apos; ,  honnigan . 
i can &apos;t lay that off in time .   we lose a bet that big ,  it could break us . 
then i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll have to impound your money until we &apos;re sure that it &apos;s all good .   can i see your wallet and your ticket ,  please ? 
meat loaf ,  apple pie and a cup of coffee . 
you sure it &apos;ll be one of these two ? 
you sure you wanna start off that big ?   bet like that could put a real dent in us . 
he &apos;ll have to take a check .   i couldn &apos;t find my wallet . 
why me ?   shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from . 
you &apos;re dreamin &apos; ,  kid . 
and you were gonna pay me back ? 
well ,  what did i tell ya ? 
lucky ,  hell .   i could do it every day . 
 &apos;cause it &apos;s better to do it all at once .   we &apos;re puttin &apos; down 400 grand next week .   at 5 - 1 we make 2 million .  twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us . 
you stayin &apos; in or not ? 
tell your friend i &apos;ll have the money here by post - time tomorrow .  we &apos;ll take the first race where the odds are 4 - 1 or better .   and make sure i can get to that window this time . 
look ,  i got nothin &apos; against you ,  but you &apos;re in trouble here .   all you gotta do is tell us when gondorff &apos;s gonna play his chump .  we come in at the sting ,  make the pinch ,  and you walk out free as a bird .   no questions ,  no court appearance ,  nothing . 
i mean completely played .   until he &apos;s beat and the score is taken .  you come in before we beat him and i &apos;ll kill him .   you &apos;ll have a tough time explaining that ,  won &apos;t ya . 
can &apos;t do it .   there &apos;re telegraph inspectors all over the place .   i got 750 grand coming in from the coast ,  and i &apos;m not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees .   we &apos;ll get somebody else to do our betting . 
i &apos;ll need a room over there that faces this way .   how much a week ? 
what is this ?   i got work to do . 
do ya know him or don &apos;t ya ? 
cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin &apos; him .   if word gets around that feds are in on it too ,  gondorff &apos;ll fold up the whole thing . 
he &apos;s gonna set up gondorff for us . 
what &apos;s your next step ,  nick ? 
then just say he was sixty years old . 
what &apos;s the matter ,  darling  .  .  .  not sweet enough ? 
any luck ? 
she &apos;s got me worrying ,  too . 
how are you ? 
you took that money from julia &apos;s hand . 
you hand that over to the police . 
mother ! 
that &apos;s what i was going to ask you .   he &apos;s disappeared ! 
how do you do ?   i &apos;m sorry we have to rush . 
dead ? 
poor dad ,  does that still bother you ? 
not at all . 
shrapnel ! 
did they find any clues .  .  .   a gun or fingerprints or anything ? 
did you kill her ? 
i saw him too .  .  .  he was wearing a green suit with a white tie .  .  . 
yes .   i might not have been shot . 
nothing . 
man to man ,  mr .  charles ,  are you working on this case ? 
what about the suicide ? 
you &apos;ve been there ? 
fifty will get you a hundred that he didn &apos;t do it . 
what about jorgensen ? 
who &apos;re you calling ? 
get anything ? 
i guess that cinches it ,  eh ,  mr .  charles ?   he killed them both  -  julia wolf and nunheim . 
he said wynant tried to steal an invention . 
shut up . 
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it  &apos;til we came ? 
what kind of clothes was he wearing ? 
that &apos;s ridiculous . 
let me go !   let me bring her back .  i can &apos;t get along without her .  i &apos;ll bring her right back and i &apos;ll tell you anything you want to know .  let me go ! 
i know . 
and there she was lying dead .   the police said she &apos;d probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there . 
why ,  you said .  .  . 
who &apos;s that man ? 
i thought you &apos;d given up that sort of friend . 
i want that money right now ,  or i &apos;ll hand you over to the police . 
well ,  let me do that for you . 
thanks ,  and goodbye . 
but what if you need more money ? 
what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants ? 
it might . 
oh ,  i know he didn &apos;t ,  but i wish i could find him .  .  .   i have something very important to tell him .  macaulay won &apos;t help at all .   he thinks i just want money . 
but he has nothing to do with it ! 
nobody told me .   i did see him ! 
it isn &apos;t a story  -  it &apos;s true .   i did see wynant .   he &apos;s not dead . 
i &apos;m lot going to stay here to be insulted  -  
how is studsy ?   i didn &apos;t know he was out of stir . 
he &apos;s dragged me into every gin mill on the block . 
pretty girl . 
how many drinks have you had ? 
come on  -  -  relax  -  -   give them a drink . 
oh ,  it &apos;s a fire hydrant . 
what &apos;s the trouble ,  asta ?   your balloon busted ?   so &apos;s mine . 
well ,  don &apos;t they ? 
wynant dead ?   does dorothy know ? 
i wish you &apos;d tell me who . 
serve the nuts  -  i mean ,  serve the guests the nuts . 
is that true ? 
how did you get in here ? 
that &apos;s what mr .  wynant said to me .  if she re - married ,  all the money was to go to the children . 
was he a good detective ? 
bonds ,  sir ? 
home ? 
what are you doing . 
and they can &apos;t fly around out there forever . 
epps ! 
it &apos;ll be too dark to make our way back now .   let &apos;s bed down for the night and head out at first light . 
stop it ! 
says they were deserters ,  they were afraid to fight ,  don &apos;t believe in saddam anyway .   they flew the gunship up here to hide out .   when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them ,  so they shot first . 
then step aside . 
we been down this road .   i told you how it is .   unless you feel like there &apos;s something you want to do about it .  .  . 
thanks for taking care of this for me . 
they &apos;ll kill you .   you won &apos;t make it ten feet before they cut you down . 
give it to me ! 
i told you ,  i &apos;m shooting iraqis . 
you know what ?   i think you got schwarzkopf .   you did !   you got the general right in the ass .   now that &apos;s good shooting . 
you all want to lay off ?   god .   i hope the iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery . 
what !  ?   what !  ? 
don &apos;t even .   you &apos;re not going to show me that tired map . 
wellllll ,  if you read it it must be true .  was it in the star ,  or the enquirer ? 
you &apos;re such a pussy ,  you know that ?  how &apos;d you get in the army ? 
third .   what you &apos;re going to do with your third . 
invest it . 
take the binoculars . 
hey .  .  . hey !   slow up .   you don &apos;t have to go so fast . 
i &apos;m gonna .  .  . i &apos;m just gonna stop for a little water . 
why you got to move away to talk !  ? 
you &apos;re going to blow yourselves up . 
this .   whatever it is . 
you &apos;re not losing trust ,  are you ? 
x marks the spot . 
but the white dot in the middle; that &apos;s got to mean something . 
it &apos;s just a mongoose . 
we got to go back .   we got to go back for wes . 
we can &apos;t just leave him . 
epps ? 
i know what i did just now was crazy ,  but you got to understand how much i want that gold . 
what do you think our chances are ? 
that &apos;s if the war is even still going on .  way things were shaping up it &apos;s probably long over . 
 .  .  . wes .  .  .  ? 
well ? 
i &apos;d go to australia .   lot of land ,  not many people .   i think after this i &apos;d like to quit people for awhile .   and the girls go crazy for brothers down there . 
planning on going to war all by your lonesome ? 
ready for what ?   sight - seeing ? 
yes .   yes .   that &apos;s exactly it .   yes . 
it &apos;s a puzzle box .   if you can figure out how to open it there &apos;s supposed to be a treasure inside . 
jaeger ? 
you ever think about dying ? 
at - at - at - at - at . 
we .  .  . we could go home with something else . 
we &apos;re going to get court martialed ,  you know that . 
yeah !   gold !   how much ? 
if there &apos;s gold .   if ! 
this is too much .   you don &apos;t even have the money and you &apos;re wasting it . 
iraqis . 
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself . 
jesus !   what the hell did he do that for ?  they &apos;re iraqis .   why are iraqis killing iraqis ? 
maybe they &apos;re as scared of us as we are of them . 
i think he wants something to drink . 
i can &apos;t hear him . 
hummmm .  .  .  .  . 
now ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
what time is it ? 
i &apos;ll try . 
what are you doing here ?   is anything wrong ? 
i can &apos;t go on like this .   i can &apos;t .  .  .  .   i don &apos;t just sit around and watch people .   if i make a mistake ,  it &apos;s all over .   you see it every day .   do you want to see me taken away in pieces ? 
if you .  .  .  . if you go back on sedation ,  you won &apos;t feel the same way about me .   you &apos;ll report me for drug evasion . 
it &apos;s all right now ,  shhhh it &apos;s all right . 
they know .   they &apos;ve been watching us .   i can feel it . 
then why are they holding us here ?  why don &apos;t they destroy us right away ?   economically ,  it &apos;s not sound at all .   very much unlike .  .  .  . 
but we need a creative dissent .  our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus ,  but the differences are differences of emphasis ,  not of fundamentals .  now ,  the new alignment &apos;s greatest need is to communicate with all its elements ,  rather than march along in parallel line that never converge .   tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly ,  we will gain a new unity . 
we must escape .   we have plans .  we can leave .   we must wait until .  .  . 
i can &apos;t see him at all .   he &apos;s been destroyed . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
what are you doing here ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
would you like part of this ?   .  .  .  . it &apos;s not much . 
just look at all those people . 
yes . 
who the heck &apos;re you ? 
sorry about that .   that &apos;s an inch of the stuff ,  imagine what the whole thing &apos;d do . 
what ? 
treat .  we treat devices . 
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith ,  bill jones .  i &apos;d see them up ahead in the hall ,  call their name ,  but they wouldn &apos;t turn around .  c . i . a .  funny thing ,  they &apos;d always disappear after the first half of the course . 
nitro - cellulose .  what is that ,  some kind of explosive ? 
why do you do it ? 
i know .  i was working a drug ring ,  deep cover .  played the part too well .  when they pulled me out ,  i wasn &apos;t a cop anymore .  my fiance had dumped me .  next thing i knew ,  i was out here on the street ,  doped up ,  auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me ,  cleaned me up ,  gave me a second chance .  he promised captain winters he &apos;d look out for me . 
how do you know ? 
glass ,  eighth street ,  alley behind grand hotel .  cut him off . 
keep talking . 
whadaya mean ? 
any word ? 
no ,  we &apos;re terrorists ,  stay back or we &apos;ll blow . 
bev ,  you &apos;re the greatest .  .  . 
computer device ? 
there is a motel downtown ,  near the machine shop .  .  .  the suncrest .  room 138 . 
looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton . 
what about the ballistics report ? 
what the hell &apos;s going on ? 
nitro ,  dash of semtrex ,  vegetable oil  .  .  . 
unsolved bombings in the last year .  .  .  boston ,  new york ,  philadelphia .  .  .  but no real match

you don &apos;t fish . 
captain .  .  .

glass ,  you &apos;re to stand by with your team . 
reilly ,  you &apos;re done for now .  what the hell were you thinking directing the bomb squad team into hot pursuit .  they had no business - 
what ?   i may lose it again ?  but i haven &apos;t found it yet !  i &apos;m sorry .  goodbye !   yes ? 
why did you let this man in ,  m &apos;sieu filiba ? 
no . 
no ! 
no doubt about it -  - it &apos;s that secretary . 
he &apos;s really not a bad fellow . 
m &apos;sieu laval ,  there are several things i &apos;ve wanted to ask you for quite a while .  i understand you are from marseilles . 
m &apos;sieu laval ,  i have enjoyed the confidence of this family -  - 
well ,  that &apos;s fine .  then you are not insinuating that i am avoiding questions .  and i am not insinuating that you won &apos;t let me examine this report .

briefly . 
i &apos;m sure they will .

by the way ,  james :  ordinarily i would never ask ,  but .  .  .  weren &apos;t you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea ? 
 .  .  . that &apos;s all well and good ,  captain ,  save for one thing :   there &apos;s no gold down there . 
what do you want with the harbor master ? 
yo !  jimbo !  i won five hundred  -   what happened ? 
 .  .  .  do you have a gun ? 
harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold .  it &apos;s on the sea dolphin ii .   and thanks to your little show and tell  -    -  giving him the evidence  -   we &apos;re the only ones who can tie him to the crime . 
he &apos;s killed closer .

can &apos;t i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ?  the world is not black and white .  show me one perfect person .  if you can &apos;t ,  don &apos;t ask me to be . 
i could swear i heard my son call me . 
i don &apos;t want to wear out welcome ,  but you can stay in someone &apos;s heart longer than you can stay in their house .  come with us ,  boy .  we are going to have a good time . 
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock .

an empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you ,  tappy head ,  you ain &apos;t worth the salt you put in greens . 
i appreciate you lending me a hand .  that lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me . 
i asked harry about it .  he didn &apos;t own up to it .  he said he didn &apos;t know what got into okra .

anna .   what &apos;s wrong ?   what do you want ? 
what ?   what is it ? 
i understand .   you &apos;re upset .   you want to know what &apos;s going on .   that &apos;s good . 
even if i knew i wouldn &apos;t tell you .  you do not want to come into contact with these people .   only carl knows who they are .   that &apos;s his real asset .  ruiz doesn &apos;t know them .   they don &apos;t know ruiz .   church and state . 
don &apos;t bother . 
and you didn &apos;t feel like you could trust my wife with this news ? 
arnie ,  do think there &apos;s a difference between a reason and an excuse ,  because i don &apos;t think there is . 
to begin with ,  she &apos;s only sixteen years - old . 
no ,  i don &apos;t think so .   leave me alone ,  give me money .   that &apos;s what i get from our daughter .   she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar . 
i &apos;m not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello . 
my leica &apos;s gone . 
helena  -  -

you should feel good about this . 
i &apos;m trying to bust the tijuana cartel . 
let me ask you a hypothetical question :  if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel ,  and he went out of power ,  would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ? 
i &apos;ve read official estimates but i wouldn &apos;t bet my house on them .   i &apos;ve heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor - trailers .   at least a half - dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope ,  with drivers employed by people who don &apos;t give a damn if they &apos;re caught or not . 
i &apos;m looking for my daughter ,  caroline .  she comes here . 
i want your money ,  i &apos;ll take your money . 
i just want to be clear about one thing .   i used to work for him ,  but now i work for you .   i &apos;m not a partisan person ,  i &apos;m an issue person .  in the next few weeks ,  if you allow me ,  we &apos;ll get you well - versed on an incredible array of issues .   the most important of which ,  in my opinion ,  being mexico .   i know everybody that you &apos;re gonna meet .  it &apos;s important that they like you .  it &apos;s not important that they like me .   that &apos;s why i can help protect you . 
salazar &apos;s been taken down .   he was working for porfirio madrigal . 
mapping the fucking pig genome .  we &apos;ll call your dad ,  he &apos;s a neurosurgeon  -  - 
well ,  why didn &apos;t you bring them ? 
shut you mouth or you &apos;ll be next . 
for fuck &apos;s sake . 
i &apos;m no a fucking buftie and that &apos;s the end of it . 
buy yourself that island in the sun ? 
excuse me ,  i don &apos;t mean to harass you ,  but i was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation .  i thought to myself :  she &apos;s special . 
come on . 
jesus . 
you &apos;re not getting any younger ,  mark .  the world is changing ,  music is changing ,  even drugs are changing .  you can &apos;t stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop . 
so long as everyone keeps their mouths shut ,  we &apos;ll not be getting caught .

god ,  you &apos;re sick . 
i know a couple of addicts .  stupid wee lassies .  i feed them what they need .  a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull .  it &apos;s easy money for me .  not exactly a fortune ,  but i &apos;m thinking ,   &apos;i should be coining it here .  &apos;  less whores ,  more skag .  swanney &apos;s right .  get clean ,  get into dealing ,  that &apos;s where the future lies .  set up some contacts ,  get a good load of skag ,  punt it ,  profit .  what do you think ? 
i can &apos;t believe you did that . 
how much ? 
but you don &apos;t have the money ? 
it &apos;s the great outdoors . 
where did she come up with that ? 
a walk . 
qual se tu ? 
we sought only your infinite wisdom . 
new course ?  you have no authority .   what &apos;s going on here ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
scotty here ,  captain .  transporter is still inoperative .  even if we could lock onto the hostages ,  we couldn &apos;t beam them up . 
she &apos;s got partial power ,  sir .  i might be able to take two of you . 
mr .  scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft .  the transporter beam is non - operational .  captain ,  we &apos;ve received important orders from starlet command . 
bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two .

then .  .  . 
well  -  -  that &apos;s how it is for programs ,  yes ,  but  -  - 
what about our friend  -  sark ? 
did we make it ? 
hey .  .  .  you guys ok ? 
but .  .  .  won &apos;t you be de - rezzed ? 
he was disoriented in transport ,  tron . 
it &apos;s all circuits .  .  .   must be an input / output component .  .  . 
well ,  i  -  -  it &apos;s just  -  -  i don &apos;t know ,  a user ,  i mean .  .  .  users wrote us .  a user even wrote you .  .  .

he &apos;s so spooked he &apos;d turn over his momma ,  his daddy ,  his two - panny granny ,  and anna and the king of siam if he had anything on him . 
he saw the wire . 
he &apos;s bluffin ya ,  elliot .  can &apos;t you see that ?  you &apos;re an actor ,  remember ,  the show must go on .

you gotta hold this for me . 
do you live here ? 
it &apos;s the kidnap woman  -  -  the one who was with the guy who tied us up . 
it &apos;s important to observe everything . 
what kind of information ? 
you don &apos;t have a driver &apos;s license ,  james ?   or a social security card ? 
why do you think there aren &apos;t any germs in the air ,  james ? 
you think it &apos;s july of 1995 ?   that &apos;s the future ,  james .   do you think you &apos;re living in the future ? 
it &apos;s just a shot to calm you . 
cole !   james cole !   you escaped from a locked room six years ago . 
you didn &apos;t have a gun before ,  did you ? 
we need gas . 
the boy in the well .   how did you know that was just a hoax ? 
james ,  you said he was hiding in the barn .  .  . 
what does this mean to you ? 
i have seen it ,  but i don &apos;t remember this part .   funny ,  it &apos;s like what &apos;s happening to us ,  like the past .   the movie never changes  -  -  it can &apos;t change  -  -  but everytime you see it ,  it seems to be different because you &apos;re different  -  -  you notice different things . 
but maybe i &apos;m wrong .   maybe you &apos;re wrong .   maybe we &apos;re both crazy . 
what are you talking about ?  ?  ? 
i don &apos;t have time to go upstairs .   the police are looking for me .   i need to know where it is and exactly what it is . 
uh ,  that message .  .  . me ? 
but you know what &apos;s real now ? 
he was fully sedated ! 
you  &quot; develop &quot;  viruses and you &apos;re calling me insane ?   typical .   what does this virus attack ?   don &apos;t tell me ,  you sick fuck ,  it doesn &apos;t matter .   have i ever  &quot; developed &quot;  a virus ?   do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli ?  do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements ?   wow !   and i &apos;m crazy ! 
 -  -  so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i . d .  ,  and he gets agitated ,  starts screaming about viruses .  totally irrational ,  totally disoriented ,  doesn &apos;t know where he is ,  what day it is ,  alla that stuff .   all they got was his name .   they figure he &apos;s stoned out of his mind ,  it &apos;s some kinda psychotic episode ,  so they &apos;re gonna bring him .  .  . 
that would explain the bruises ,  i guess .   the struggle . 
hey !   you there ! 
maybe i do . 
you afraid of the dark ? 
you don &apos;t fear death ? 
not this twig ,  friend .   i got plans . 
nothing . 
it &apos;s nonsense . 
where to ? 
but ,  in particular ? 
it &apos;s your radiator hose .   it &apos;s busted . 
hey ! 
yeah ,  right .   someplace in this dust bowl i can get something to drink ? 
goddamn you !   you son of a bitch ! 
what the hell  .   .   .  oh it &apos;s you .  might &apos;ve figured .   what do you want ? 
what was that all about ? 
taking a little trip ? 
that wasn &apos;t so bad .   what &apos;s thirty -  some - thousand to rich folks like you ?   it didn &apos;t hurt a bit . 
jake .   i thought you would be at work ,  dear . 
you don &apos;t have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day . 
somewhere else .   i &apos;ve never been anywhere else .   just once .   years ago .   went to the state fair .   it was nice ,  but it wasn &apos;t nothing . 
i didn &apos;t say it bothered me . 
i like them .   i was sick of looking at this room .   i think they add a little life . 
you love him ? 
lied ?   what do you mean ? 
shit ! 
i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now .   is there something you wanted ? 
get it ,  and put the money in it .  pack up anything else you want to take with you . 
to get my car . 
one - hundred - thousand dollars .   a little more . 
he was going to take the money . 
is that the kind of girl you think i am ?   what can i do to make you relax ? 
the police don &apos;t know that .   and it &apos;s going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck .   i &apos;ll take you as far as california .   if we can even make that .   after that i &apos;m cutting you loose . 
john !   can you hear me ?   are you still there ? 
you idiot !   you &apos;ll kill us both ! 
i &apos;m not a murderer ,  mr .  mckenna . 
sweet grace ?   what about her ? 
don &apos;t play simple with me ,  jake .  you want me to spell it out for you ?  i &apos;ll kill grace if you cut me in on the money . 
just to get out of here ?   that doesn &apos;t seem much for a murder . 
maybe  .   .   .  ten - thousand .   and that &apos;s a maybe . 
what should i do ? 
no . 
the time wasn &apos;t right . 
drop it ,  jake . 
jake ,  how much were you going to pay me to do the job ? 
he did more work on the car .   he wants fifty bucks extra for it . 
i came for grace . 
this morning when i came in on you and grace ,  you swore you hadn &apos;t so much as been near the bedroom .   now you make straight for it . 
don &apos;t jake me ,  boy !   it &apos;s a big house .   odd that you would know your way ,  except maybe you &apos;ve been in the bedroom before .   maybe with grace to keep you company . 
you &apos;re right .   i don &apos;t give a damn about her .   but to fuck a man &apos;s wife behind his back ?   that just makes a fool out of him .   i don &apos;t like being made a fool of . 
you &apos;d tell me anything to save your pathetic life . 
got any requests ? 
mister ! 
suppose you &apos;ve had all you can of sierra .   what with that ruckus you had with toby .   oh yes ,  i heard all about that . 
why don &apos;t you step out of the car ,  son ? 
nobody &apos;s going to hang .   we &apos;re all gonna walk away with a little something .   i ain &apos;t a greedy man .  and ,  hell ,  you did all the work .  one - hundred - thousand dollars .   split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty - three thousand .   give or take . 
you sure got a lot of philosophy ,  old man . 
what ? 
time &apos;s up .  any last words of wisdom ? 
i wasn &apos;t doing anything . 
mister ! 
didn &apos;t much look like you were hanging drapes . 
i guess we &apos;ve never been introduced proper .  jake mckenna . 
well ,  i guess i have what you call a love - hate relationship with grace . 
you drive a hard bargain ,  but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you . 
next time you &apos;ll do just fine . 
two - hundred dollars ? 
hey mister .  mister ,  i just .  .  .  i just wanted to thank you . 
that &apos;s what i thought until you came riding in .   i saw your car over at the gas station .   it &apos;s a cool car .   want to take me for a ride ?   desert &apos;s kind of lonely this time of day . 
toby tucker ,  it don &apos;t matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he &apos;s just drooling and bleeding all over hisself ,   &apos;cause we love each other and we gonna run off ,  and i &apos;m gonna have his love child . 
harlin around ? 
i know it &apos;s busted .   what did i just tell you ? 
hey . 
one of those days you feel like you been runnin &apos; in circles and you ain &apos;t no closer to where you tryin &apos; to get than when you started ? 
no charge . 
well ,  now ,  you just know all there is about bein &apos; a mechanic ,  don &apos;t you ?   didn &apos;t you read the sign . 
is that an insult ?   are you insulting me . 
got any cold soda ? 
my name is bobby .   now i &apos;m not a stranger anymore .   see how easy it is for us to get to know each other ,  beautiful ? 
you &apos;re not from around here ,  are you ? 
what happens when you lose ? 
i guess .   i &apos;ve got an ego same as any man . 
nice place . 
a medicine man ? 
are there snakes out here ? 
is that why you &apos;re with him ? 
i &apos;m guessing no . 
all this nothing ?  it doesn &apos;t get to jake like it gets to me .   he says he don &apos;t mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond .   more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole . 
it &apos;s not that easy .   maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please .   i can &apos;t .  i don &apos;t want to be alone .   i need to know i &apos;m going to be taken care of . 
you &apos;d never understand . 
why ?   am i making you hot ,  or does the truth scare you ? 
we &apos;ve still got some dead weight to get rid of . 
i &apos;m not sailing his boat . 
don &apos;t you think i would &apos;ve done it if i wanted to ?  what can i do to make you relax ,  baby ? 
i think nothing happens .  you &apos;re dead meat .  that &apos;s it . 
thank you .  thank you .  i .  .  . i knew you wouldn &apos;t leave me ,  grace . 
i busted my leg ! 
there was a young fellow over at jamilla &apos;s today when it got hit .   way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .

when was the last time i wore pink ? 
would you like to try going -  - 
this city has had its share of disasters .  well publicized ones .  it was around the time of that plane crash ,  when it first entered my head .  and there it stayed ,  as i waited and watched the news over the years .  .  .   and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed .   and just like that ,  an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality . 
i must have felt some lump in his back when i bumped him .  most guns have a black or silver handle .  i had a fifty - fifty shot at the color . 
i am .  i &apos;m helping him with the sale . 
he &apos;s got the most beautiful eyes .  .  .  the hell kind of question is that ?  he &apos;s a guy . 
when ? 
jeremy .   i &apos;m going in .  i have to do some things . 
how much did you take off ? 
how are you feeling ? 
in the passenger car ? 
did you get up from your seat ? 
now you &apos;re going to have to tell me more .

i couldn &apos;t find no bullwhips ,  bill .  the german .  .  . 
some big guy beat the shit out of me .   i guess i must look a lot like you ,  huh ? 
yeah ,  i guess . 
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies . 
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin &apos; ,  but nobody &apos;s gonna pay good money for a cut - up whore . 
there ain &apos;t no snakes in here ,  mister hendershot . 
you work for the railroads too ,  mister beauchamp ? 
duke . 
well ,  that bullet whizzin &apos; by panicked corky ,  an &apos; he done the wrong thing !  pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe .  meantime ,  bob aims good and squeezes off another .  .  .  but he &apos;s so drunk he misses again an &apos; hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar .  well ,  now the duck of death is good as dead  &apos;cause this time corky does right an &apos; aims real good ,  no hurry .  .  . 
i do not like assassins an &apos; men of low character like your friend english bob .  .  .  but bob ain &apos;t no coward who will cry to your face an &apos; then .  .  . 
don &apos;t tell nobody about the reward an &apos; all .  don &apos;t need no other gunmen tryin &apos; to collect . 
well ,  what were you lookin &apos; at anyhow ? 
an &apos; how there was two deputies up close pointin &apos; rifles at you .  .  .  had you dead to rights .  .  .  an &apos; how you pulled out a pistol an &apos; blew them both away to hell .  .  .  an &apos; only took a scratch yourself .   uncle pete told me he never seen nothin &apos; like it ,  shootin &apos; your way out of a scrape like that . 
get some sleep ,  kid . 
you &apos;re gonna lose your share .  if you don &apos;t .  .  . 
it &apos;s a hell of a thing ,  ain &apos;t it ,  killin &apos; a man .  you take everythin &apos; he &apos;s got .  .  .  an &apos; everythin &apos; he &apos;s ever gonna have .  .  . 
wha .  .  .  what f - for ?

i told you i &apos;m a damn killer .  i done it before .   i &apos;m more killer than him . 
what was the money for ? 
don &apos;t give up on me now ,  dean . 
i love you . 
that &apos;s enough ,  edie . 
so what is it you do ,  mr .  kint ? 
how many times have you been in a line -  up ?  it &apos;s always you and four dummies .  the p . d .  pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time .  no way they &apos;d line five felons in the same row .  no way .  and what the hell is a voice line -  . up ?  a public defender could get you off of that . 
why don &apos;t you just calm down &apos;
roger really .  people say i talk too much . 
you watch your mouth . 
how are they going to do it ? 
no killing ? 
what - are they speaking ? 
keaton ,  i can &apos;t just  - 
what about redfoot ? 
i hear you did time with old spook .  yeah ,  he was a good egg .  i used to run a lot of dope for him .  fuckin &apos; shame he got shivved . 
he won &apos;t go into the interrogation room . 
oh ,  i know .  sweet deal you have .  total immunity  . 
you know ruby is in attica ? 
there &apos;s nothing in there about ruby . 
the first thing i learned on the job ,  know what it was ?  how to spot a murderer .  let &apos;s say you arrest three guys for the same killing .  put them all in jail overnight .  the next morning ,  whoever is sleeping is your man .  if you &apos;re guilty ,  you know you &apos;re caught ,  you get some rest  -  let your guard down ,  you follow ? 
oh come on ,  verbal .  who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?  you really expect me to believe he retired ?  for a woman ?  bullshit .  he was using her . 
you think i don &apos;t know you held out on the d . a .  ?  what did you leave out of that testimony ?  i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes . 
no .  but i &apos;m sure keaton &apos;s dead . 
so this lawyer .  .  . 
came from redfoot . 
you tell me ,  agent kujan .  if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor ,  what would you say ? 
i &apos;ve got immunity now .  what can you possibly offer me ? 
if he &apos;s dead ,  verbal  -  if what you say is true ,  then it won &apos;t matter .  it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york ,  wasn &apos;t it ?  tell me the truth . 
is he keyser soze i don &apos;t know ,  verbal .  it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield .  like you said ,  a spook story ,  but i know keaton  -  and someone out there is pulling strings for you .  stay here and let us protect you . 
mr .  abraham .  .  . 
 .  .  .  tell me about this case . 
so what i want to do is stop it here .   i &apos;m going to make him an offer .   i want to do it myself .   i want it to come from me . 
yes . 
 .  .  .  here &apos;s your mail ,  call mrs .  doneghy  .  .  . 
you know what that would mean ?   to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he &apos;ll testify ? 
no ,  actually ,  she was referred to me .   she was dr .  hagman &apos;s patient .  .  . 
answer affirmatively .   simply .  keep those answers to three words .  you weren &apos;t `part of a group ,  &apos; you were her anesthesiologist .   isn &apos;t that right ? 
anything special about the case ? 
thank you .   when debby .  .  . 
mary rooney ,  the obstetrical nurse .  .  . 
we went to code blue .  .  . 
you reached down into death .   now ,  isn &apos;t that right ? 
engaged to render an opinion .   for a price .   is that correct ?   you &apos;re being paid to be here today ? 
orthopedics ? 
uh - huh .   still practice a lot of medicine ? 
i did . 
the document is disallowed ,  the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form .     it &apos;s unsubstantiated and we  can &apos;t accept a copy in preference to the original .  .  . 
just now .  .  . 
now .   i &apos;d like to ask you something :  four years ago ,  when you were working as a nurse ,  are you aware that drs .  towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed  .   .   .   ? 
i do .   yes . 
 .  .  .  we told them we didn &apos;t want it to come out this way . 
what is this going to cost ? 
i &apos;m going to win this case .  .  . mist .  .  . mr .  doneghy .  .  . i &apos;m going to the jury with a solid case ,  a famous doctor as an expert witness ,  and i &apos;m going to win eight hundred thousand dollars . 
i .  .  . given the limits of your question ,  that &apos;s correct . 
and you wrote that .  .  . 
we have to  .  .  .  we  .  .  .  we have to keep you under wraps .   please don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t discuss  .  .  . 
i &apos;ll just take a minute .   deborah ann kaye .   you know what i &apos;m talking about .   the case is going to trial .  our chief witness is a dr .  david gruber ,  you know who he is ? 
he &apos;s the assistant chief of anesthesiology ,  massachusetts commonwealth .   he says your doctors ,  towler and marx ,  put my girl in the hospital for life .   and we can prove that .   what we don &apos;t know is why .   what went on in there ?   in the o . r .   that &apos;s what we &apos;d like to know .   something went wrong .   and you know what it was .   they gave her the wrong anesthetic .   what happened ?   the phone rang .  .  . someone got distracted .  .  . what ? 
i want someone who was in the o . r .  we &apos;re going to win the case ,  there &apos;s no  question of that .   it &apos;s just a matter of how big .  .  . 
and it seems to me ,  a fella &apos;s trying to come back ,  he &apos;d take this settlement ,  and get a record for himself .     i myself would take it and run like a thief . 
i need an extension for my case . 
yes ,  mr .  galvin ? 
are you done ? 
we find that your subscription lapsed .  .  . 
that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling ,  miss price .  .  . 
i &apos;m a lawyer . 
and it &apos;s over .  .  .  ? 
joe .  .  .   joe .  .  . 
been a long time ,  huh .  .  .  ? 
give  &apos;em a box of macanudos . 
she &apos;s workin &apos; the late shift at the hospital .   she &apos;s at home now ,  i &apos;m going over there to talk to .  .  . 
are you with me .  .  . are you awake .  .  .  ? 
we don &apos;t have anything from the nurse association ? 
i talked to johnnie white at the bar association .    the broad used to work for one of concannon &apos;s partners in new york awhile ago .    she wanted to move to boston .     how badly did she hurt us ,  joe ? 
i &apos;m  .  .  .  mrs .  doneghy ?   i &apos;m frank galvin  .  .  .  why didn &apos;t you go in ? 
we just can &apos;t do it anymore .    this is our chance to get away . 
are we going to win ?     we have ,  you know ,  other tactics ,  though .  .  . 
she told me . 
kathy price .  .  . 
you were the admitting nurse at st .  catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth ,  nineteen seventy - six ,  the night deborah ann kaye was admitted .  .  . 
another ,  frank  .   .   .   ? 
you have a record of what happened in the operating room .  .  . 
but those notations stop .  .  .    .  .  . four - and - one - half minutes after deborah ann kaye &apos;s .  .  . 
 .  .  . they start again three minutes earlier .  .  . 
yes . 
i can give you one thing :  he was in love with her . 
shouldn &apos;t you be sitting down ? 
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife ,  what would you say ? 
no . 
how often does this happen ? 
i want you . 
ernie &apos;s . 
great - grandmother .  the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death  -  was madeleine &apos;s grandmother . 
nothing . 
how do you know all these things she doesn &apos;t know ? 
could i ask you a couple of questions ? 
no ,  i happened to see you come in ,  and i thought  -  - 
what do you want to know ? 
then will you for me ? 
tomorrow night ?  well  -  -

they &apos;re not my parents ,  helen .  my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much . 
mom ,  dad .  meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in .  he &apos;s what you &apos;d call clinically bummed . 
if you could just sign right there . 
that &apos;s it ?  i mean ,  you don &apos;t want to order room service or anything ?  we could play games and watch movies and stuff . 
so ,  william randolph .  your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale . 
i didn &apos;t know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job . 
i tried to warn you ,  william randolph .  she &apos;s got stiletto heels hidden in those keds . 
considering this is your first time on a private jet ,  on which you are interviewing the world &apos;s most eligible bachelor ,   you are extremely cavalier . 
i see . 
you &apos;re amazing . 
cut to the chase ,  william randolph .  your audience is way ahead of you . 
look at us .  it &apos;s one o &apos;clock in the morning ,  on a school night .  we &apos;re in a smoky nightclub ,  hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart . 
that has more to do with your proximity to me . 
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish .  not many people know that . 
shoes ,  if you want to know the truth .  shoes are my thing . 
what about you ? 
a portuguese boyfriend .  sounds very  &quot; cosmo .  &quot; 
turned out to be a scoundrel ,  eh ?  i saw that one coming . 
i have to be honest with you ,  ted .  i really despise  &quot; the girls of xenia .  &quot; 
which explains the continued success of  &quot; heaven &quot;  for how many decades ? 
just a few tokens of my affection .  i &apos;ll be back soon ,  don &apos;t worry . 
oh ,  good lord .  are those neptunes ? 
everything i am is because of you .  can you ever forgive me ? 
i &apos;m warning you . 
you kicked us off your turf ,  merk .  don &apos;t rain on our parade . 
i told you you could do it . 
no one will be laughing at you now ,  ted .  you can take that to the bank . 
it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t have ideas ,  i had plenty of ideas .  but i never even shared them with your father .  never had the guts . 
at our press conference tomorrow ,  i think we should announce our plans to explore the world .  not just a few leggy 36d &apos;s ,  with blond hair upstairs and down . 
are you familiar with  &quot; heaven ?  &quot; 
all i can tell you sam ,  is hang in there .   they clear you of this mess ,  you get reinstated ,  with back pay .  .  . 
got sort of hung up on her ,  from what hear . 
the next thing .  .  .  his hand was in my shorts .  .  .  you know ,  from behind .   his fingers .  .  .  his fingers .  .  . 
they were in me .   both places .  .  .  you know . 
yes .   i said stop .   i screamed .   i mean that &apos;s how it sounded in my head .   he hurt me .  .  . 
kelly &apos;s file .   read it .   you &apos;re going to find an angry ,  sexually confused girl who &apos;s made threats on her mother &apos;s life and a female lover she &apos;d never identify . 
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark .   you know what you get ?  more bark .   and more bark .   there &apos;s no core .   tree &apos;s not good tar anything but sucking up water .   and now they can &apos;t get rid of them .   they &apos;ve tried poisons .  nothing works .   they don &apos;t die . 
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay ? 
you saw the news today ? 
i thought of that .   then i said ,  come on ,  you &apos;re lombardo .   your reputation is getting trashed .   you want to stop the bleeding .   you don &apos;t want to sit in jail for three months .   unless .  .  . 
where &apos;d you come up with this stuff ,  anyway ? 
if you want company .  .  . 
her grandmother said she &apos;d been threatening to run away .   and i found the car at the miami bus terminal . 
he did say something . 
kelly &apos;s next ,  gloria . 
i fucked up .   i lost control of the situation ,  the one thing they train you for .  .  .  god ,  what did i do ? 
i told her i was coming with her .   she nodded ,  like she understood .   we stood up together . 
this wasn &apos;t my idea . 
come on .   beats study hall ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
you know ,  i want to thank you for getting me into this class .  .  .   no way was my old man going to spring for the fees .  .  . 
i can &apos;t believe you called sam .   what &apos;s the matter with you ? 
i thought we were goin &apos; to a movie . 
is there some reason why you &apos;re here ? 
get off my property . 
what ? 
kelly .  .  . 
god ,  you scared the shit out of me .   you must be crazy coming here . 
from now on ,  if we &apos;re seen together ,  it &apos;s got to be accidental .   i thought that was understood .  .  . 
so if they &apos;re tapping your phone ,  we &apos;re dead .   stay in the guest house .   skip the graduation parties .   you &apos;ll never see duquette .   okay ?   i love you . 
that never seemed to worry you at the glades . 
i &apos;m placing your daughter under arrest . 
davy . 
you .  .  .  i should &apos;ve killed you myself .  should never have left it up to him .  .  . 
yes . 
but she ran away .

artemus gordon .   bach ,  he &apos;s the composer .

that &apos;s a lot of butler . 
well .  .  .  that ,  too . 
you might have mentioned you had that . 
thank you .

no record of him . 
so the idea is if a guy punches me ,  he really hurts his hand ? 
well ,  we &apos;ll stay in touch .  .  .  you know . 
he calls it the tarantula . 
he &apos;s not giving up ? 
well ,  where i come from it kind of goes with the territory .   texas . 
have you taken a wrong turn ,  mr .  tyler ? 
she &apos;s perfectly safe . 
you know ,  i really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me . 
mr .  president ,  good to see you again ,  sir .   sorry about all that . 
but what would anyone have to gain from all this .  .  .  ?   unless it were a foreign power . 
we find ourselves at the dawn of the golden age of science .   and it is the god - given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way ! 
sir .  .  .  i believe you have only two barrels . 
now it &apos;s a bomb . 
well ,  come on ,  that &apos;s half a dozen armed men .  .  . 
sorsha .

willow .   to learn magic ,  first you must make your own philosopher &apos;s stone ! 
what &apos;s the magician &apos;s weapon ? 
are you sure ? 
we are emissaries of her majesty ,  queen cherlindrea ,  of the land of coshairm . 
i &apos;m getting her out of there ! 
obviously . 
milking ? 
i &apos;ve seen pictures . 
eat up ,  book .  what &apos;s the matter with your appetite ? 
where &apos;s timmy and buck ? 
put my car in the garage and close the door .

amish . 
so one of them got to him . 
you might want to pass it along to mac . 
it &apos;s all over ,  paul . 
i &apos;m a police officer .  i &apos;m going to have to talk to the boy .  what &apos;s his name ?

eli is a fine carpenter .  best in the district .  he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago .

there was a time when i would have welcomed it . 
i &apos;m not so sure of anything as you are ,  john book .  you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough .   just as i could live yours ! 
i want you to take this .  .  .  to remember by . 
where i &apos;m at is maybe 1890 . 
either you &apos;re a member of the club or you aren &apos;t ,  elton .   tell me what you know .  .  .

frightened ?   you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death  -  -  sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe .   i was petrified .   then suddenly the wind changed ,  and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city ,  where i was instantly acclaimed oz ,  the first wizard de luxe ! 
oh !   oh ,  zeke !   help !   help me ,  zeke !   get me out of here !   help !

and him a brain . 
it &apos;s beautiful ,  isn &apos;t it ?   just like i knew it would be .   he really must be a wonderful wizard to live in a city like that ! 
i &apos;d be too scared to ask him for it . 
that noise don &apos;t come from no ordinary bird . 
 .  .  . don &apos;t talk . 
whhhooops !   ha - ha  -  -  there goes some of me again ! 
oh ,  no  -  -  i just keep picking it up and putting it back in again .

count to twenty .   when you get to twenty open the hatch .   it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink . 
dislocated collar bone .   if any more tendons snap .  .  .   it wont just be two weeks out of action . 
the report king bought .  its a manual .  renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead . 
i am just a middle man .  i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner .  .  . 
revenge isnt so hard to fathom .  whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it . 
he was my father . 
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone .  especially kings daughter . 
you dont take no for an answer ,  do you ? 
i cant stay . 
you knew when you first saw me .   you knew it would be like this . 
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division .

so beautiful .  so smooth ,  so warm . 
had a lot of blood in him . 
what &apos;s your theory ?

then do me a favor .   if the world &apos;s going to end ,  it shouldn &apos;t matter a bit .   i want you to cure me . 
its very strange .   times flowing backwards  .   .   .

you &apos;re full of yourself .   what are you doing ? 
dan ,  is this  -  -  is this new york ?  ? 
hiya ,  pardner .   long time no see .

nothing .   what were you going to say ? 
no comment . 
you &apos;re not  &quot; protecting &quot;  anyone .   these people &apos;s lives may depend on the answers you give .   these are all former associates of dr .  manhattan  -  - 
what about you ? 
i don &apos;t know who you are buddy ,  but i swear to god ,  you got the wrong guy . 
two things i hate .   street mimes  .   .   .  users of recreational drugs .

congratulations ,  you &apos;ve just graduated at the head of your class . 
you &apos;ve really got me confused ,  cage .  on the one hand you showed leadership ,  courage under fire ,  a willingness to protect men you hardly knew .  .  .  and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic .  help me out here .  i &apos;m not following your evolution . 
now i &apos;m the one who &apos;s nauseous .  so what &apos;s the deal ?  what do you need me for ? 
what do i get out of it ? 
not bad for a gimp . 
how about a pedicure as long as you &apos;re down there .  what &apos;s this ?  lo - jack ? 
i guess you got my e - mail .  i set up a purchase .  ten cars . 
thanks . 
kinda funny ,  though ,  isn &apos;t it ?  we &apos;re not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway .  guess we shoulda played by the rules . 
all for show .  just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing . 
the usual prospects .  convicts ,  contract killers ,  murde .  .  . 
next we got a siberian redneck ,  viktor .  into snowmobiles and snowboarding .  so naturally ,  he covers prostitution and the drug trade . 
just about anything i want ,  it looks like .  this is gonna be tough ,  though .  there &apos;s no way to save this game .  i gotta get it right the first time through . 
you agree with a lot of what he says ,  don &apos;t you . 
where are we going ? 
we can &apos;t leave now .  we have to do something . 
where &apos;s he headed ?

dude ,  what are you doing here ? 
sorry ,   &quot; dude &quot;  . 
oh come on ,  don &apos;t feel bad .  you got played ,  so what ?  you &apos;re new at this .  did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ? 
heads up ,  man .  what &apos;s this thing on my back ? 
don &apos;t look at me ,  x ,  she handles all the details . 
very nice .  i &apos;m impressed . 
he &apos;s not with us ,  xander .  he must be with you . 
you got it ,  man .  it &apos;s stupid but it &apos;s true .  true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want .  that &apos;s when you know you &apos;re living ,  man . 
what &apos;s the gimmick ,  yorgi ?  that &apos;s the part i don &apos;t get .  you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ?  i didn &apos;t think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche . 
thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb .   he had the energy source .  he had the vacuum .   but he didn &apos;t have the filament .   he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power . 
yes  -  -  only there &apos;s a problem .   the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature .   it &apos;s forcing the body &apos;s cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they &apos;re accustomed to .   the senator &apos;s body is literally burning itself out .   scott  -  -  this machine kills people and i don &apos;t think magneto realizes it . 
scott .  .  i  - 
i &apos;m o . k .   i &apos;m o . k . 
anything else i can get you ? 
i &apos;ll see what i can do  -  -  you should get some sleep .   even with your healing ability ,  you &apos;re going to be hurting for a while . 
you wouldn &apos;t happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to  -  - 
you .  .  .  wha .  .  .  who are you .  .  .  where is henry ? 
what am i doing here ? 
who ? 
i wouldn &apos;t really have let you die ,  you know .   i just needed .  .  . 
doesn &apos;t it ever wake you in the middle of the night ?   the feeling that some day ,  some day very soon ,  they will pass that foolish law  -  or one just like it  -  and they will come for you and your children ?   take you all away ? 
and has he achieved .  .  . any special degree of eminence ? 
oh ,  shit . 
no ,  sir .   it will never happen again . 
what ? 
you &apos;re incorrigible !  .  .  .  aren &apos;t you ? 
did you see ?  .  .  . i put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts .   the other one is just for socks and poo - poo undies . 
so this is what it &apos;s like to be completely happy ! 
darling ! 
you have your tickets ? 
goodbye ,  darling . 
darling ! 
darling !  ?  ! 
what a strange fellow . 
i don &apos;t want to spoil anything  -  -  i just want to top it all off . 
i hope you find this comfortable .  this was baron victor &apos;s room . 
you mean .  .  .  the laboratory ?  ? 
no !   dr .  frankenstein always kept that separate . 
i don &apos;t think so .   is my assistant taken care of ? 
well .  .  .  if you &apos;re sure that i could accomplish everything in a week .  .  .  i suppose i could manage it . 
not at all  -  -  a great privilege ,  doctor . 
but look at what &apos;s been done with hearts and kidneys ! 
but ,  sir .  .  . 
why isn &apos;t it frodereck fronkon steen ? 
no ,  it &apos;s pronounced aye gor . 
yes ,  that &apos;s right .   my grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together .   you and i should have a lot of laughs . 
this is inga .   they thought you might need an assistant temporarily . 
are these your bags ? 
the wockers with the knockers . 
taking the book along ? 
i want that brain . 
oh !   may i call you  &apos;master &apos; ? 
original . 
no ,  no !   that whole thing ! 
there &apos;s only one way . 
nice !   nice little balance to it . 
did you have a pleasant trip ? 
i know ,  but usually i can fall asleep right away .   it must be the strange room . 
inga ,  wake up ! 
a god ? 
it looks that way . 
it &apos;s terrible  -  -  the price society demands in the name of fidelity .  .  .  ultimately ? 
i know ,  but i mean  -  -  not fooling around physically ?  .  .  .  or not fooling around intellectually ? 
there can never .  .  .  ever .  .  .  be anything physical between us .  you know that ,  dear . 
it wouldn &apos;t be fair to elizabeth . 
yes ,  i will . 
all right if i turn out the lamp ,  sweetheart ? 
mmmmmmmmm ! 
his what ?  ? 
it &apos;s working !   oh ,  doctor  -  -  you play beautifully . 
three minutes to go ! 
oh ,  must be around ten .  .  .  ten - thirty . 
you afeared of the zulus then ,  quartermaster ? 
why don  &apos;t the zulus attack ? 
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory ? 
do not confuse yourse{fi why ?  we must strike a heavy blow .  this cannot be a war of manoeuvre . 
what &apos;s that strange name the newspaper chap &apos;s called ? 
the only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the royal kraal ,  at ulundi . 
lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos .
