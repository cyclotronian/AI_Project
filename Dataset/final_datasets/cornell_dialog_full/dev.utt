Why?
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
How do you get your hair to look like that?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
She okay?
They do to!
Great
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
In 9th.  For a month
Let go!
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
So -- which Dakota you from?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Number one.  She hates smokers
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
A hundred bucks a date.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Okay?
Why'd you let him get to you?
And I'm in control of it.
Answer the question, Patrick
That ' s completely adorable!
My insurance does not cover PMS
Tempestuous?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
What?!
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
Are we going to argue?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
My letters of appointment.
How far from here?
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
To bring the word of God.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
How did you manage it?
The ocean is uncrossable?
May I speak freely?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
What's he doing?
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Are you married?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
I'm gonna propose.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
You thirsty?
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Hey, honey.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
So what's unique?
Any chance we can do that again?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
Turn that fucking thing off!
Whore?
I did.
Let me get a shot of it.
Yes, the money is good.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I know.
A cheap hotel.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Well, he killed my partner!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
How was it?
What are you gonna do?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Really.
How?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
You're kidding.
Hal?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Any ideas about the colour?
What do you mean?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
What's the matter with my place?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Where's ganz?
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
What do you think?
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Where's the goddamn car?
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
We missed.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
You okay?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
You real down?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Surprise, Luther.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
You are a monster, Zorg!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
6... 5...
What did you say? What did you do?
To save the world.
It's my wife.
Apipoulai!
Apipoussan?
I'm so very sad.
...Like love...
At least I won lunch.
It's not?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Hello?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
You couldn't?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Anything harder?
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
... sorry...
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Celebrity Films.
Don't ask questions.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You're making me very angry.
You almost went over your limit.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're learning.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He's odd.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
What was she running from?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
How... how can you say that to me...?
Do you know what happened to her?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You in a hurry?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Been up with Alice.
What is it?
I gotta get out of here.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I'm so sorry, honey...
Alice!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
What?
He sure loves to stay awake.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They think I'm nuts.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
It's okay.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
Cyclops?
You hear that?
What about down?
Now they feel it...down below.
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
That's a <u>face</u>???
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Are you alright, Wade?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
If you get it?
Mmm.
They said.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
That's illegal, you know.
You're a policeman.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Huh?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
See. Get your boots.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
I know your parents.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Take care, Wade.
The other guy.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
You remember Margie Fogg?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Daddy...
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Can we do that?
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
You know what?
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
Other way around, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Now!
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I guess this is a first for you.
My career is shot.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Can I hold him?
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
He's carrying a bomb.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
You can't go in there!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
George Zipp said that?
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No. No one that I know of.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
We'd better get back now.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Yes?
Roger.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
In there.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Yeah... I know the routine.
Was.  Divorced.
I'm going home.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
We?  You've taken it?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Shit!
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
But there's no more drug.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Yeah, Sykes?
How can I go?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Movement!
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
What's the question?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
They'll get us.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
What did you say?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Yes.  A little girl.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Why not?
What?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
And how will you make him keep it?
You have leave to try.
That's stupid.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
What's the matter with you?
Yes!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
There's a young girl to see you.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
You're not going to do this?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Who was that?
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Originals?
Alone.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Hey!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
What a strange young man.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Sire.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?
Yes, what about him?
Pupils?
Why not?
Are you playing a trick on me?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Yes?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
I can't say. Really
But what is it they don't like?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Did my work please you?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Do you have me?
I am so ashamed.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
How well are you trained in music?
Is it true?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
What anger?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
He's not?
And what else?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
What shall we do?
Aw come on, Miss Price!
What? Oh, yes, please.
What?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
My friend Jack was just here.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Some, everyone does.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
That's a wolf's head.
Say, David...
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
It's you, David.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What can I say, Jack?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Because this must be stopped.
Excuse me.  Yes?
Remember the Alamo?
Hello, Tom.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Charlie!
What's the matter, Charlie?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
And tell him not to delay.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
I'm not interested in what you think.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Much better this morning, thank you.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Longer.
Good morning, Helen.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
They must have turned him down.
Dude Finlay?
What time did you get in?
I ain't done --
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
What you sayin' boy?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Where you boys going?
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What do you say, sir?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Such as?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Easterners.
But still died.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Let the law --
Let me see that.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Good.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Uh huh.
I can't.
Dorsia's nice.
This is Dorsia?
Pull out.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Are you using minoxidil?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
I'll do it.
What is it?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Jean?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
A model? An actor?
Well...
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
How old are you?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I mean they want to get caught.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
I've questioned him.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Speak up. Come on.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Great!
That'll be a test, won't it?
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
What?
That's gotta kill him, right?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
...Hello?
How's it going?
You did this -- overnight?
You've been coming in early.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
You could've handwritten it.
What'd the girl say?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
What're we looking for?
Lisa.
Did I say something?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Time?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
That kid's the great white hope.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
May I wash you?
To my health.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
When do I begin?
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
She's working on another lead right now.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Why?
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Austin, what's your point?
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
Noooooooooooooo!
What is it now?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
What did you say?
What about his teeth?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Nature ...
May I help you, madam ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
But
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Do you always drive this fast?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Where am I?
You followed me.
And do you trust me?
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Insane ... ?
Why?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
This man -- did you see him?
John Steed.
The last one you'll ever see.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
What?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Seventy-five hundred.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
I love that car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Cole?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I can't trust you!
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
You okay?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Are any of those right?
I'd love that.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
I'm not really hungry.
How'd it go?
What are you going to do about it?
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
Did you do it for Tim?
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
People actually used to pay you for this?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Goddamn it Stephen!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
With grenadine, right?
Arson.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
You think that's really any of your business?
Thanks for the invite.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
I don't know anything about it.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
I need another one, sir.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Completely out of control.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Who's going to die?
He treats you okay?
You want some coffee?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Yeah, him.
We're ready when you are.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
So that's what you been doing?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
But the line has to be drawn.
Word!!!
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
What do you want?
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Let's get him over to the bed.
How long has my father been like this?
You lost me.
What point is that?
Hello.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
What is this?
Why'd you do that?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
So they can be on TV.
No joke.  Serious.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Finland.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Yes you!
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
...yes she did.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
I don't know who I am.
So what's up with you?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
You don't read, do you?
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
I know I won't be your puppet.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Good gracious!  What is this?
I have no luggage.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Who else can give me information about you?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Not even that.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible?
Does this assignment interest you?
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
He loves me, as I love you.
You framed-him...
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Some.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
He -- He made me do it --
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
What business?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Bullshit.
His chest was hamburger --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
He admitted it.
Something funny, Levi?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're off to a late start.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Why do you care?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Are you sure?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
I pushed him too hard.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
I was freezing from the hurricane --
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Who, Levi --
What happened with Nunez?
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
This is totally unnecessary --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
You were expecting me?
I have to leave. Tonight.
Or are you too scared?
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You're not trying to run away?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
I thought you weren't dying.
Son?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Tell me how it happens.
You don't even know me.
This is it? The whole vault.
Are you Jenny Hill?
How did you know my father?
It's bad.
Do you love your father?
What happened?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Sorry. You've lost me...
What did he say?
I need to know who you are first please.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
So?
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus.
I don't want to know.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Oh Jesus.
No.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes which?
Some... What does that mean?
I got what I paid for.
Excuse me?
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Have you had any before?
Are you scared?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
It's not mine.
What does it mean?
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
More cough syrup?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Holy shit.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Better?
I keep the heat on.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Like a man.
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
Could you do somethin' for me?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I don't want you to let go.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
All right, how's the new partner?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
I've continued working on the case!
Did I say that?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
She disappeared... shit!
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I want to go talk to him.
It's illegal, Nick.
No...
Don't give him any more.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
We're in?
You'll get Ich killed.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Dope?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Because I want you to tell me.
What's this?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Would you like to be modified?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
You could help us.
I think, therefore I am.
Six, huh?
Industrial refuse.
You equipped for random questions?
Not if it works.
Next.
Number three.
I like you.
Nerves of steel.
What if you change your mind?
What the fuck for?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Is there anything else?
You use your equipment, don't you?
I can imagine.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
How are you doing?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Uh-huh.
You know what I think?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Hi!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
I came on a bus.
Again.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Hey, what are you doing?!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Thank-Q!
I think it's the eyes.
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Who are these people?
Very funny, smart ass.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Because I want to get married.
I didn't know that.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Really?
You wanted to see me!
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
These are wonderful.
Like a painting?
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Uh-huh.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I love Lucy!
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
When did we get it from them?
I don't think so.
Good-bye, Adam.
And thanks for always being happy!
You dial nine to get out.
The sky?  Where?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Whatcha looking at?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
This is your bedroom?
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
He drank it hot?
Good god.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Thirty -five years!
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Is there a problem?
Calvin?!
Watch this!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
In the generator room again?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
What are you bitching about now?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
What's it to you?!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
What's wrong?
We came back to the house!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Jeffrey?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Why do you do it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
Hi, can I come in?
Nice guy. Who's he?
Come in.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
He's comin' back? What for?
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You really want to do this, don't you?
Brilliant.
Yeah, but.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You saw a lot in one night.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
Okay, okay.
You were late.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. No. Why?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Fuck you.
I need Il Duce.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You think they sold me out? No way.
Yeah, well...
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
They got nothing.
You guys?
Hello.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Is that right, Rambo?
That was way easier than I thought.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
They were wearing masks.
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
So what are you thinkin' here?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
And the pennies?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
No. You sure you're okay?
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Has he now?
You're right.
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Making Hutch David Soul?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
What does Starsky say?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
How was I ridiculing you?
Did you see that?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Is that the manager?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Well, then cut it in half.
I'll just say it.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
May I have a word with you, please?
When'd he tell you?
Why don't you come with us.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
We've got sixteen dollars.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Who's in the car?
Shit, Dignan.
Where's Kumar?
You're kidding.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Did Dignan take the test?
Exactly. Woah.
Future Man.
Let them fight.
How long are they going to hold him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
No.
They are.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's my responsibility.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
The weed.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Do you have your own room?
Wait a second --
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
How you doing, Bob?
How long do you have to go?
Ground defense.
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
Is that your chiquita?
You like Chicanos?
I don't know.
You told me Bourne was dead.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
That's not gonna fly.
Berlin!
Had to be done.
Sir...
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
Pamela Landy?
You called it in?
-- car keys?
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I love you, too.
I did.
I know it's a dream.
See that tram coming around the corner?
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Oh, shit...
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
We need to get in there.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Mr. Nevins?
How long have you worked for the agency?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
But... what will you do?
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
What is it?!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
You'll move
Good to see you again.
We must run in different directions!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I'm dreaming.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
We can't stop!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
I... I blacked out.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
What did you see? What did it look like?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
I know, but...
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Why are you doing all this for me?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
There's one major hole in your story.
What time is it?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
And you are...?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Come on, go on...
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Lenny? Come on!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
He did. Captain Renault did.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And you want to know --
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
And Mademoiselle?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
A franc for your thoughts.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
For the last time, put them on the table.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
You are very kind.
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Ask me?
Ilsa, I --
No, Victor, there isn't.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And I congratulate you.
We'll come again.
I understand.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Even in Berlin.
What else, my dear Major?
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Hello, Louis.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Oh, but I just told you. --
He is traveling with a lady.
I have my orders.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Give me another.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Rick! Rick, help me!
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
It's bad.
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Sonofabitch!
He is a cute thing.
No.
Her name's Hannah.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Need some help?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
That's why you're a gambling man.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Cool ropes.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
That's what it's about.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
What, then?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And that I can drive a truck!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What'd she die of?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
What's the *medical* explanation?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
You don't understand! It's her father...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Do you think she'll be all right?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
What's an immigrant?
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
Liberator...
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
But she's your *daughter*...
What business is you in, Homer?
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Where's the name sheet?
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Who cares?
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Then it's malaria?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
We had to finalize the deal.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
We were back on.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
We'll take care of it.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
You'll be there?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Why?
Come on. Harder.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
What do I have to do?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Look at you... You want to go.
Stop waving that thing around.
It's bad luck.
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
And we got rid of the red head.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Stand up.
Sorry. What?
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Pretty much.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Still time.
Ten percent.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
It's just insurance.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
My car's in the garage.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
I found her in bed with someone.
Last hand.
Where did you get it?
You're my prisoner.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Are you trying to read my palm?
I loved it blond.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
The door, Jack.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
I've lived there.
To coincidence.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Which side do you like?
I'm in trouble.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
How much do you owe?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
You've been avoiding me.
What are you, a cop?
Does Bella come here?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
What happened to Bella?
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
How do you feel, Jack?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Where is the key?
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well of course I exist.
That's it.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Pinback...
Yes.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Commander Powell would have named it.
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Veil nebula.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- automatic channels open --
TALBY!
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
What's that, sir?
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Commander? Are you still there?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll make it worth your while.
What else can we do?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Sophy?  Are you okay?
You're a thief?
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Lemme get my coat.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
How do I know you didn't?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
Well, not me personally.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
With your help.
Who is it?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Look, I don't know what you want--
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Say the words, "I understand."
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Make the call.
She's got my word.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
More like deployed in bed asleep.
No, I mean... you love your son?
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
What the fuck!
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
I found the Volvo.
Could be.
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're not idiots.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
What do you want?
Gimme your gun, boy!
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Beg pardon?
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Wanna walk me home?
Don't look so freaked.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
Will you please talk to me?
Come with me.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
You're such a fuck-ass.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
So, I met a new friend.
Don't you watch the news?
How are things going at school?
What else do you think about during school?
Is Callie still around?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Regret.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Because I'm so horny.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
He was a year ahead of us?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh shit!
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Mom!
Ow!
That's it, I'm goin'...
I hate her!
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Annette, just use your hand.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Oh! What is it?
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Who to?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Here I am, Father...
What do you whistle?
That was for you.
No, but I shot some ducks.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna work at all.
Send in the next girl. 
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
They have noble faces.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
Don't!
Good morning, Treves.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Treves. Well done.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
She's very pretty, your mother.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Romance!
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyess.
Merrick...
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Ohhh...
...my... home?
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Yes John?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Won't come out, eh?
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Do you believe I love you?
The second note.
Then I shall come too.
How?
I'll tell you what...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Why?
Is THAT Odin?
What are you talking about?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Let's hack her to pieces.
That's terrible!
Halfdan the Black's here!
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
Who have you been talking to?
Faster!
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
You mean we'd be dead?
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
You'll be sucked down too!
I think we should go...
But HOW?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
Sven!
Yeah... well...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
Same thing, isn't it?
Who's that?
What?
Sh! Hurry!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Well, of course he is!
Well, go on! Go berserk!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Why what?
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
I like it.
I can't remember.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
It's okay.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Take care.
Um --
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Ready for another?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
You should stay.
Tomorrow?
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
How can you watch this crap?
So, um --
I want to know you.
Joely...
Such a beautiful view.
Yeah?
Well, you're married.
Hi there.
You said...
Oh God, how horrid.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Listen, did you want to make love?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
How's the chicken?
Naomi.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
So what's going on, Joel?
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Hi.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Hey.
I know what it is.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
You made me have an abortion.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Mary. What are you doing here?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Does that help?
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
What do you believe in then?
You don't?
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
How does she like what in bed?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Why? Why do you have to go?
Thanks.
You're the best?
Whooee!
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Can you shut it down?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
You're not seriously considering sending him?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
Does he know that?
Patch me through to him.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
This is Weir.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
I can see that, what're they for?
Explanation?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
What about my ship?
What are you talking about?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Heading three-three-four...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Smith, get out of there...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Miller, come in...
Weir.
First time in a grav couch?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Almost got it.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
What is it?
What is it?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
Ben, come in.
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
How long was I out?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
What the --!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Back it down, Johnny!
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Sweet.
I'm driving.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
But I'm not done with the machine --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
On the ledge?
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
I take out the garbage.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
You are a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
Leave me alone.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I would. Yeah.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
Who's that?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
Don't you like him?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Was it great?
You'll always remember your first time.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Does that ever happen?
I paid for it and everything.
Not coming? What happened?
Mr. Spicoli?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
You better save some for me, you swine!
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
How about the point?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
You keep them.
This is a nice car.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Where's your brother?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Naw!
What happened? What did they do to her?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
I want to leave fast.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Jesus.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Lucy.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
So do we, lady.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
Careful.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Well, it don't look pretty.
We shot a skunk.
What tunnel? Where?
You all sure about this?
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Come on!
I'm in.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Huh?
Will these boards hold?
Nine?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
I wouldn't do that, son.
Welcome back.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
Move it!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Let's wait it out.
Go! Go!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
You know you don't have to do this.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
What're you doing?
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Okay, but come here first.
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Get your clothes on, lady --
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
Francie, you know I can't do that.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Bread?
See you next weekend?
But, Kurt, I...
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
How'd I look?
Jesus.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
You're telling me.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
What's left of my blood.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I'll bet.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Evening, gorgeous.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Where to?
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
And no people.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
You think I got it?
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
I don't believe so.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Oh! Are you really?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
You what?
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Friend?
Soon?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Have you seen Willie?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Brother and sister still?
Our decision. Together.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Henry Clerval.
Quite a few.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
How much longer?
Yes? And?
Quite a place.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Professor Waldman.
Ah. An explorer.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Melvin Belli.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Oh, my God...
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
It sounded like Brenda.
What's the matter with it?
I'll be along.
You know what I said, though.
Claudette...
Let's go back, Barry...
It's gonna be a long summer.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
What about Neddy?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
How much do I owe you?
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Why do you want to stop?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
You don't believe in suicide.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Why'd ya quit?
Who else?
He backed down.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
To your family.
You too, preacher?
It's the bitterest of pills.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
What do you think Mom would say?
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
What?
Do what?
Do you believe me?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Are you okay?
How many bullets left, kid?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Hot goddamn day!
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
What dya mean?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
This isn't gonna work.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
What do you mean?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
How are you?
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
None at this time, sir.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
No, sir, WHAT?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Permission to leave, sir?
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Ah, c'mon...
Fine by me, sir!
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Think I overplayed it?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
O'Neil?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Just a coincidence?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Jordan...
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Which is guy-speak for...
They're more afraid of you.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Who is it?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
What?
That why you dumped him?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Animal, I can't.
He's not going to do it.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
You never said it was off the record.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Your old sweetheart?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Are you looking for this?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Not again...
He wants to THINK!?
And note the sucked in gut.
We heard it the first time!
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Oh.  Okay.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
What does the Omega 13 do?
How did you come to that conclusion?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
No, wait, are you-
What?  Up?
Systems register functional.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
...The digital conveyor.
Oh, they're so cute.
I am SO SICK of being right.
...Okay
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Thank God. Are you okay?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Weapons storage...
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Former Commander?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
A model, only as big as this.
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Oh, right, sorry.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
NO NO NO.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Continue forward, sir?
Find them.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Over three hundred miles.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
The army needs you.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Let's not over do it...
Partially...
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
You must be very rich.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
What's this movie you're doing first?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Karen? You okay?
I'm working on a few things.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
Ray Barboni?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Or else what?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You're an investor, is that it?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
For a movie?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
You don't even know these guys.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
I had to tell 'em something.
You've been losing.
How? By taking my money?
We call you a taxi.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Why not?
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
I told you not to -
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Where from?
Roger.
What other choices have we got?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Get up.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
What's this?
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
What the fuck -- ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
What's slow?
That's a good thing?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You sure it wasn't me?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
The same day she supposedly went down.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Nope.
What?
So you killed them?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Yeah.
It's funny.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Morning.
Ho-ly shit.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
It's a Noaa buoy.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
What are you trying to say?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
...wow...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
So Josh...
Oh, hi...
This is so bad, it's almost good.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
What is this?
Look at how cute I am!
This is way too creepy.
That was truly pathetic.
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Where are we going?
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I'll bet he never jerks off...
I didn't get it either.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Look, we have to get these...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
There.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
May I ask what you're doing?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Do you have any old Indian records?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Oops! I dropped it!
Really? Can I see it?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I don't think so...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
So, why did you bring this along?
What did you tell that girl?
Jesus...
For nineteen years...
Hey, can I borrow this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Never...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Wow!  What was that all about?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Thank you, doctor.
I am a man of peace.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
I am also liaison between these two.
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Everybody has a choice.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
You're also a human being, Frank.
No, you didn't, Frank.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
Good luck.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
That's quite a story.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Well, good night, Louis.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who?
This is what you do with your spare time?
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
My Fault!
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
You got a flux and a half.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
She's moving!
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Where's the Keymaster?
What now?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Sorry, Buddy!
What happened??!!!?
What is it?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Ray -- Something's here.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Do you believe in God?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Where have you been?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Then you'd be out of a job.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Give away food?
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
Narcissus!
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Take your hands off me animal!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Then get a large cash advance.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Could you do it?
Will you take me home now?
Where is the car?
But could you try?
What is the matter?
With a family?
You mean the one who --
I'm meeting someone.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
What?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Why wouldn't it?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
The day after tomorrow?
Exactly how do you mean?
What are you then?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Mr. McCleery?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
BENJAMIN?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Where are you?
What?
Yes sir?
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
All right then.
Did you know that?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Won't you unzip my dress?
Then why do you keep running away?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Hello, Benjamin.
Do you want to?
What?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Why did you do that?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
Do you remember the make of the car?
No.
Good.
Did I say that?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
But it's not.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
What have you done to her?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I drive around.
Nothing else.
When did you two talk this over?
Well --
I don't know. I want it to be --
Why?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
No, I don't.
Benjamin -- where are you?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You were very different yesterday.
Yes -- I'd love to.
You live here?
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
No.
No?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
Grusinskaya --
Very early in the morning.
I can't.
Why?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Is that too much, Baron?
I've no luck.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
The war.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
For me?
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Oh!
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Dance then? 
You're trembling.
Please -- please!
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
What...! --
Moreover --
How nice -- your daughters?
I must go to England -- at once.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
You're sweet.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
Shall I tell them again?
Madam has slept well?
Take them back, Suzette.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Last night?... There was no applause.
You're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
What's bluff?
What do you want with her?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Motherhood.
You know it, Lilly.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
Why?
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
What's that?
Expecting visitors?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Myra followed you, huh?
Just a few bucks.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Roy? It this all we have?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
What?
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Why am I here?
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Where?
I can be real stiff.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
What the --
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
What?  Where is she?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
I can see that.  Why?
Then I'll get caught.
Mom -- Who is this?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
What if your parents come home?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Promise?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Danny?!  Danny!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
You've created a monster.
At least we found the diamonds.
I didn't tell you everything.
You know what gets me?
Months?
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Insurance!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
We got to get another pilot.
What went wrong?
Gee whiz--
I wouldn't drop my gun.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
College!
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
I'm a man.
Dad--
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Some kind of animal?
Disease?
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
I have some change!
Breakfast?
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
Such as?...
You learned this in some college course?
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for Paul as well.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
I'm an honorable clown?
No.  No.
Leave the rifle here.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Because he was cruel?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
No.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
Oh, Paul--
A what kind of doctor?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
My father!
Don't worry about it.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He'd assume we had.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What's the matter now?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
The what?
They didn't murder me.
That's been said before.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
No.
No, I don't.
What?
What do you mean?
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Joanne?
Where's he?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
They're legal now.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
But this is my apartment.
What happened, pilgrim?
What happened?
Is Marsha there?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
You're talking about real excitement?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
It's an investment.
To his own daughter?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Jake'll take care of me.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Come again.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
A block of ice.
Eh, no. Thank you.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Maude, do you pray?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
But they'll put me in jail.
Yes.
Why?
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
I'm getting married.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Oh, is this your father?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Fifteen.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
The box. I need the box.
O.K. Let's go.
I... remember.
Where am I?
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's almost over!!
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
What are you trying to say?
You're kidding --
You want me to hold him down?
Where do you --
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
You're going alone?
But it's not true, is it?
Hit me.
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
No time for argument.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Frank --
Wedded bliss?
Help me.
No. God no.
What happened to you?
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
What's the problem?
How long since you were here?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You're still blaming me.
Well?
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Julia?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
-- I'll go see.
What's wrong with you?
Drinking alone.
Well, isn't it?
No, not much.
I suppose not.
You know, you're very beautiful.
I'll get the doctor.
Great.
Big house.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I guess.
Are you busy after work ?
Can I lend you a hand?
What did I say?
'Bye.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
We'll do it next Monday.
Not the point.
What?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Great.  Can I have it then?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
He's got one!
Anna.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Oh.  Okay.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Is there a difference?
Is that it?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Let's not.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Is it better?
Hi.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I told you I slept with him.
Hello.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
What about Ian?
C'mon.  I want to know.
What it was like.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
No.  Probably not.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
What's happenin'.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
What's the -- hey, Liz --
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Are you okay?
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
That way.
I'll call you.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I warned you.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Huh?
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
He was unsual.
No.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Byzantine?
Someone beat you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have friends.
What about me?
No.
You're wrong.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
He is older than I.
Don't.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
A murder.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Who is it?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Your marks would suggest great injury.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Who am I deceiving?
Not so scared.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Spare a chair?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Yes laddie, I have her.
All I need is time.
Morning Mr. North
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
Hildy!
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
How long would the interview take?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Save that for the Tribune.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
What do you mean?
Now you're talking!
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Where do you think you're going?
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Hildy!
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
No!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
In a way.
Sure.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Hildy, darling!
It'll be Heaven!
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Who do you want?
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Let's see the money.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
How's everything, Gus?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Where'd you get this?
Where is he?
Just one second --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
And so do I!
You'll take fifty and like it!
You fight it cut.
Have you got my dough?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Don't talk too loud.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Hey --
What do you want?
What's from the Governor?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Is it hard?
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Look out!
Get the cops, somebody.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Baldwin -- his name is.
Can I try?
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Pauline's mum got killed.
Do you know any swear words?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You're the biggest fibber.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Wow!
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
No Turks.
You joined up.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
And where do you think you're going?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It was the best time of his life.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Which way?
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Hey, great they're back.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
How long have you been running this place?
No, no I think it's really interesting.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Should we stop?
Go around him.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
How long has it been?
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Where's Bill?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Say my name.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother says he likes you, too.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'll be in touch.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
So, how's it going today?
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Ugnh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Boys just passing through?
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
We'll be there.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Character.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
So does Eddie.
I'll beat him the next game.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Maybe. You want to play?
Well... well, now.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Just like that?
That's right. When?
What time?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Who's he?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Long wait for a bus?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
I could always get us a bottle.
Why?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
You glad?
What do you want to tell me?
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Fifty-seven.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
You name it.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
That is not now, human!
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
You want to find them.
I don't know.
You want me to stay?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
I surrender --
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Need some gas?
Only got one kind.
You built things.
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
What did he talk to you about?
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Don't go in.
What do you want me to do?
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
A countdown to what?
Pops!
What the hell is that?
Spunky?
Perfect, she's using it.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Where's it headed?
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
How do you know?
He's trying to impress you.
You can't go. Call them back.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
Your son.
Really? Ballet?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
I shouldn't have left her.
How' he doing?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Marcus!  I did it!
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
What about you?
Henry, the pen --
Are you expected?
You could be more right than you know.
Uh-huh.
No. You like the way I do things.
What are you going to do?
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Dad!
Well, what was left of him.
What?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Dad?!
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Uh-huh.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Then we'll die.
And why were you trying to kill me?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
What?
They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What you look at, Indy?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
You all right?
What do you mean -- how?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Indy! Help me!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
What is it...?
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
You're in my head...
Your name is Al...
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
My place, can't you see?
Are you threatening me?
What for?
Are you crazy?
Now what?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I don't know...To get Al.
JOE Or what?
I did. I brought you back here.
Gone where?
I'll get in trouble.
Oh yeah, to what?
Where are you going?
Now, where would I be?
But what's it look like?
Much too blue.
What did that cost?
Get close to them.
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
On what?
Sapporo..
Where are you going?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Ow!
What?
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
He aready made the deal..
What happened?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Impossible.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
I don't want to intrude.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
When you do...
When you remember...
Who?
Ahhh...nothing.
Don't do it!
Now you know what I know.
Then who did?
And you.
What's so funny?
Wait. What's your name?
You again.
I waited for you.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
Who was?
And you?
Where we going?
I know the territory.
What happened?
Are you alright?
Excuse me?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Mom.
Three hours.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is my gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Mike... Mike... Mike...
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Hi, baby.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
What's wrong?
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Alright?
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
Give me a break!
Look, I really don't have that much time...
...but that's as far as I go...
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Seven dwarfs?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Jeff...
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Where are you, anyway?
You try and have a good time.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
"I would bet on it."
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Hello.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jail?
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
My God.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
You like kids.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
These are yours.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Hello?
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? When did I say...?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
From a -- girlfriend.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No.
Honey, I could sit...
Hi.
You don't like me?
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
We are. And it's winding down.
Lilly's up.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
You're not...
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Wait. I know you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
That's delusional.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Extinguish?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
OhMary
Who said anything about a reward!
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Peter Warne! 
Oh, nono.
Are you going to see him?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
What would you like to have me do?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
What happened?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Oh, yeah?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
My ticket?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
What for?
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Your ego is colossal.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Here
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage. 
Nope. No complaints.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Detectives!
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I better go over and see her.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Yeah.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
But what!
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You think it's simple, huh?
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
What'd you give him for the car?
That's swell!
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Better go back to your bed.
You're forgetting you're married.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
But can't you wait until morning
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Get out of here!
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Yeah, where am I?
What do you reckon that's for?
Thenyou'll have to git !
What's the idea?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Where do you live?
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
What do you mean?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
That's our case!
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
...you heard echoes.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
You know who the mayor was?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Jim Garrison?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
What are they?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
How old is that machine gun shit?
She sound scared?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Help us do what?
You don't want much, do you?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
I'd love one, but not there.
What did they want to know?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
He's the one who wants you.
Really?
I walked right past you.
How old's Annette?
You don't actually do it that way?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
It'll be more than that.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I didn't use you, Max.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
If I don't cooperate?
He say is a surprise.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
I thought I did.
I have no idea.
If it'll make you happy.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
What about you?
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
The Cockatoo Inn.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
Plus the same deal as before.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Where were you?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
Lemme have the bag.
I'm carrying it.
Thanks, Baby.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Guess where I am?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
That's Winston. He works here.
House or apartment?
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
This place stinks.
My office.
Uh-huh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Daddy!
Daddy. Let go.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
I am.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
Louis, you're a life saver.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
No.  I see them.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
What's your name?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Where are you?
The room!
Did you look around the headboard?
Who? Jed?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
I must have been out of my head.
What do you mean you can see?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
You okay?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Don't gimme that.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
He said you didn't have one.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Don't!
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I can waitress. I'm good.
What's going on?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Jake, what is it?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Please come quietly.
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
I just need to talk.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Everywhere, like a plague.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
I have some ice from the machine.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Can we blow it with just two?
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Bomb?
Uh-oh.
Nice touch.
Shit!
Hey! I'm not ready.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
It bought us some time.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Jesus what the hell is that?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Sergeant!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
See? We're not so bad.
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Did you like it?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Well?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Now that's just gross.
You must shut down the engines.
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
I don't know...sorry?
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Do I have to?
I gotta go back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
You're not going anywhere.
What good will that do?
Guys, please come with me!
How do you open the damn door?
What have you done?
Can we get through these?
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
What's that one, there?
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
You too, sweetheart...
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I hope we get some more help.
What day is this?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
What's that supposed to prove?
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
You're being really immature.
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
You know it's okay.
Just like our moms and teachers!
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Nails? Really?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Cool it.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
I rock a Harmony.
When was this, like '96?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
We definitely want it to have junk.
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Uh, thanks.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Can I take your coats?
Juno? What's going on?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Yeah, she does.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Is this Juno?
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Hly shht!
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What?
Like what? Be a rock star?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
I'm cool.
What's this?
You took this picture?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
...I don't know.
Brian.
Carrie.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Carrie, watch for Early.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
You were plenty hot.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
What happened?
His Parole Officer.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Did she suck your dick?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
Right.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Casper! Was up kid?
You goin'?
You sure?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
What is it?
You know what I want to do?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
You didn't?
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I'm coming.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Hi mom.
Not too late.
Where does everyone sleep?
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
We seem to have a little problem here?
What's that supposed to mean?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Morpheus.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
No.
You got it on the board.
Then let's narrow it down.
You want me to what?
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
What do you think?
We'll find the evidence.
Hello, Peter.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
But you said you didn't know her.
I'm just trying to play the game.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
How?
Have you any idea what the message is?
Hello.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
What is it?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
Has he gotten through to any?
Anything?
How long she been dead?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Then I'll transpose.
You're always in the middle of a match.
What do you see here?
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Well, I think I've had enough.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I think it's interesting.
In a way.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Of course.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
Did you call?
I tried again and got through.
Nothing.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Have they harmed you?
Colwyn ...
Lyssa ...
The White Castle has fallen.
There is no other way.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You choose these?
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
I'm not hungry.
Well, I'm not impressed.
You've eaten nothing.
Go, join them.
You!
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Where are you going?
Sugarballs?
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He will not!
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
You know the voice.
Each to his fate, lad.
But you would not stay with me.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
OK, I'm fine.
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Rocket launcher.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Mathilda? May I come in?
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Risky business, isn't it?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
May I ask you a personal question?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
You can't sit here like that.
...OK... Good.
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
It's impossible.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Nothing's going to happen.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
What would you like us to do?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
What steps do we take now?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
The new store?
No.
I thought we both wanted the same things.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Your father?
Why there?
Maurice?
Red flag, man.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
This story is big huh?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
... My father.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't have kids.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
What's your shoe size?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
I sometimes fade out.
Do you want to fuck now?
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Thank you. What time is it?
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Yes.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What do you mean?
Sera you are crazy.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
What do you mean?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Please!
Will you lighten up, please?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
You have been lonely?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
But it's a top three school --
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
Come again?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
So everything you just said --
Was she carrying a weapon?
After you went to all that trouble?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Is she?
You ready?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
Uh -- family.
Our group is full.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Too demure?
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Don't ask.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
And you know this for a fact?
The what?
Projecting joy is not my job.
Oh, my God!
No -- it's just -- not me.
How could this happen?
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
I don't know --
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
Amazing how?
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
You go where?
I didn't mean --
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Is it a Kappa?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
We come watch... we come watch...
Fire moat... why do that?
Birdies... pretty...
You go to lady now?
Your love.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Like some vile toadstool.
Damn you!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
You come stealee tleasoo?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
I meant no disrespect.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Shhhh!
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Fine-looking army.
Worse than the battlefield.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
My God!  Look!
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
What make ye of that, Jack?
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
There aren't enough arrows.
What magic have we on our side?
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
How much longer?
Where are you going?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
What?
What's this now?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
What became of the princess?
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I'd be honored.
And charmed, of course.
In every way.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Lost?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Marco!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
He's not there.
I put him to work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Atonement.
He must.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
I wanted him to marry her.
You'd hate him for the trick.
Why is that?
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
He won't leave my room.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
Forty.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
This has got to stop!
I'll be around to check up on you.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
Probably in the bible.
I don't know.
I'm not doing it!
I'm not even listening.
That's not true.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I wish you had told me then.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Sun glasses?
I would have killed him.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
Can you build a house in four months?
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
God, you look like crap, George.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
You should lock your doors.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I love those doors.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Oh...with his ear infection!
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Nothing.
I wasn't sure.
To shave your chest?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Hey.
You got a dog?
The door was open.
You could keep it and rent it out?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Why not?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
Comfortable?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Start your job? What kind of job?
No, tell me what's so funny.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Alright. You want some pie?
Guess we better get going, huh?
What are you talking about?
What ain't there?
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
No, man. I want you to have it.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
I know people.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I can't do it.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
He's from New York City. That one, too.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
What's your name?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Is this a joke?
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
How did you see me?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I didn't murder anybody
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Now everybody sit down.
I mean... tough break.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Boogerland!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Looking for the chief.
So I followed him...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Please. You got to.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
You got the wrong window again, man.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Nicky!
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
It looks like the work of a brother...
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
Hey...
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
How do you think we got here??!!
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
What's going on, Logan?!
Why aren't you in Nursery?
About what?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Are you here to help me?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Uh-uh.
Are you taking me to them?
Will you take me with you?
What do you suppose this was...?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
...But I still have the choice...?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
What belongs to the people?
Goodbye.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Are there any other humans?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
I'm sorry.
Listen.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Have you partied with him?
You like it?
What deal?
What's he do?
Pornos.
Alice...
Where's the bathroom?
Yeah.
What's up?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
We know that.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
What's your axe?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
That's why I married you.
Same one you were reading the other night?
When you didn't come to the club.
We will.
Suit yourself, champ.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What are you guys doin'?
I don't know.
Sheila... Stop...
A what?
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Huh?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
And the wine - excellent.
Goodness, no!
108 and still active?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
As far away as I ever want to be.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
I don't know.
Well - I mean
Uh-huh.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, come back!
What about the porters?
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
Good.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Was this your idea?
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
What do you want him to do?
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
You think we're nuts.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Helluva night, isn't it?
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
what's this?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
The radio show?
Jesus Christ...
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Since how long?
in case I need it?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Sure.
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
What do we do?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Nowhere.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Found it.
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
He's gone, too.
How'd you know?
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
What?
Take it.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
Why?
You don't remember me, do you?
I put you away --
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Somewhere near the capital?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
If it's a question of authority.
Are these all of her previsions?
Just go to the beginning!
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I forgive you.
I forgive you...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What about the picture --
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
You said they're destroyed.
This is all my fault.
It's insanity around here.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
So there is a way to fool the system?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
What about your meeting?
Howard --
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
As far as...?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
Ricky's not wearing one.
It's daytime.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Goodbye, Bobby.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Yeah.
So, when's the drop.
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Where is this happening?
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Taken care of?
Can you check?
Sorry, man, but...
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
We look good this year.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Nice work.
It's ours.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
What are you doing?
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
He woulda told us right?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
No.
Calm down.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Three and a half hours?
Hey, boys.
Kinda. Yeah.
Where's the surprise?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
What's up, man.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
How do you know it's not drugs?
It means you got a gun?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
No shit?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Yeah.
I call 'em wiggers.
Can I borrow a piece of --
We're square.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Yeah.
Edinburgh.
Dip?
What they call you?
Where can I get a hold of you?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
It hit?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
You're a damn liar.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
You ain't lying.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Don't con me. Don't try...
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What for?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Little.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Make it plain.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
We need you too!
I assumed...
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
You're my father.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
What am I doing here?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
[Daniel.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[And I had my men ready.]
Were you provided with a gun?
Is it loaded?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
So how's business?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Where are you from, Creasy?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
What are you doing?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You've done much of this work before?
It makes it all seem so serious.
Creasy... Wait.
Rosanna Guerrero.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Who told you that?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Oh.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What they say?
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Marty.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
I'm stag.
Are you kidding?
I'm just here with another girl.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
Hello, Ralph.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Sure.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Where?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Don't you use olives?
Epidural hematoma?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Y'all mind the store.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
When will he be able to write?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Ravenous. What about you?
Is that liquor?
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
All of them?
What's the matter?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
You're asking for somebody else?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
They missed the boat.
No, never in the slightest.
How much time do I have?
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
What's wrong with you?
O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
What's the bastard really like?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Hello, John.
Uh-huh . . .
Better let me talk to him.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
The Websters!
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
The letter.
You made it up.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
What's the idea?
Had any schooling?
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
I trust him.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
Yes! I was paid! But the
She isn't?
Oh!
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
I know one way you can do it.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Is there a crowd in the street?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I don't know.
Floor seats.
How can I help you with the particles?
Where's the car?
You don't have to come here.
Are you in charge, Roper?
How do you feel after a shooting.
Recruited you from where?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
We won!
He's got the girl.
You're crazy.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
McCall, you all right?
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Hey.
Maybe you should be.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
What do you think?
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
Repoed this morning.
Roper...
Any verification on numbers.
God-Damn you!
How come I can't remember?
Why --
You were right.
The guests are here.
But this is impossible.
What's happening?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
The new world.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Dream?!
Where the hell are you going?
How long?
The maze has been changed --
What?
Won't be time if he gets access --
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
What is it?
Then how do you know about --
What's so funny?
Don't know what you're talking about.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
I'm in!
Here you go!  No pushing!
SKULL!!
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
I am the mighty ape!
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
What do you mean?
I got my partner in there!
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Four-twenty-eight.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
No. They envy you.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Like Don Maranzano.
How soon can we pull this off?
Come off it, Bugs.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
What are ya thinkin'?
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
You get fifteen percent.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Forget it. That's past.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Who did this?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
DEATH!!
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Oh my God...you're proposing?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
I might wake up.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Stu...LOOK!
Who told you we deal drugs?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
He seemed quite taken with you.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Where to?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Oh--yeah--
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
My first name's--Clarissa.
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
That infernal phone!
Sam Foley--dead!
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
One minute! Just one minute!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Oh, now--
Yes, Ma?
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Go ahead--punch.
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Committee.
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
What?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
On paper?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--don't know it, do you?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Chick--
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
You want to see me, Senator?
No?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
How nice.
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Good morning.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
He's still pixilated.
Any children?
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Were you present when all these things took place?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Have you seen the papers?
He played in the town band, too.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Ready?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
People have been crucified before.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Sure.
What's bothering you, huh?
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
You try it.
Fourteen carat?
How is this, sir?
He's not home, I tell you!
Come on, John. What happened?
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
You're going to New York with us.
Will you have a cigar?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
We provide opera.
Now, where were we?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Mrs. Semple?
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Your Honor
Proceed.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Brookfield just came in.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
Is she home?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
What do you think you're doing?
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
You can go out there if you like...
I see.
Why not?
I was... never satisfied.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Althea hasn't told you?
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
You do?
What do you want to know?
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Doc...
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Got a license?  But no car?
What's wrong with her?
What's happening here?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Finally, some common sense...
When did you start to feel this way?
What?
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
We're only talking about six weeks.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Damn! What is your name?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Sorry...
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
That was a terrible thing.
Who the hell are these guys?
I never killed a priest before.
Altar boys?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Goin' somewhere?
C'mon, friend.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
You...! YOU...!
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Who are you?
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Yes!
How's your dad?
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
At the Frankenstein Center.
I'm going inside.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
What's that?
Wow.
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
You did?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Hi.
This is bad.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Are you sure he's still lives here?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Why are you carrying the dog?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Oh...?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Good evening, sir.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Who is it?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
Do you know what you're saying?
You mean you heard them making love?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Naw, I already ate.
Nobody!
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
You know what this is?
You better stop running from that girl.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
It works.
What we gonna do?
You see that?
You go first.
What you see?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Huh?
You did all this for me?
Next time, page me first.
Can I help you?
You coming in?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
What kind of activity?
That the big one, huh?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
What you say?
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Debo!  Debo!
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
All right, I'll do it.
Amtrack?
Business or pleasure?
Somebody close?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Can we go now?
You're out of your mind.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
I think you better put that away.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
You remember me?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Well?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Put her on.
He never told about the money.
Where's your Mom?
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
And the Lord told that man --
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Lynch him! Lynch him!
What?
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I tried to save her.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Tell me a story, John.
John...
Where's Mom?
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Where are we goin', John?
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
I'll tell you a secret.
Now it's your turn.
O no! Your turn!
Can I have my supper please?
Didn't you have no inkling?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Hello?
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Bring him out of what?
Rod's not a lunatic.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
What's with the bars?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
What is it, Ninotchka?
From Leon.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
How are things in Moscow?
Comrade Buljanoff...
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Have you?
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
What's that?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Don't hold that against me... please!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Suppress it.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Thank you.
Glorious, analytical...
Oh, let it ring.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Room service speaking.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Go on.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Did I hear something about jewels?
Thank you.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Hello, Leon darling!
Good morning.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Here, please...
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Cigarette?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
At Pre Mathieu's.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
Is it?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Why me?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
I like it.  I like the idea.
This is not a joke, John!
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
This is June twentieth?
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
That was civil war.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, why not?
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
... little Bobby.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
You'll win the nomination.
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.  They've been at it now for a year.  Young kids just like Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this whole damned system of government is ...
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Kissinger?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
How the fuck did you know?
Who we working for?
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
So I'm supposed to be ...
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
I'll do it.  No more.
You don't have to go.
Buddy? ...
Anything.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Yes!
Tomorrow.
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How come're you doin that?
You're discouraged.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
Probably must be.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Yessir. It was punched out.
...Be careful.
Don't hurt no one.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I got it Mama.
You can't afford one?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
What's that.
Who is this.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
How much?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Tent poles.
You already have the tent?
I want you to take me to another motel.
No, one forty-two.
...But that won't last.
It's called a transponder.
Cast iron?
Pot metal?
Why would he go to Odessa?
The heroin. You don't have it.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Junior year!
A woman can write a check.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Any idea where it is?
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Who are these idiots?
Do you know why I'm here?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
No... what about your sister?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
That's very kind of you.
Oh, you mean Fred.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
George...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
How did you know?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
What are you doing?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
What do you mean?
Could you give us an example?
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
That is so right.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
I hope you're right...
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
How'd they describe her?
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
Wesley...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No... before that.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
It ain't the law!
That's right!
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
...Pete?
Huh?!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
Devil his due.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
It was a powerful air.
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
It's bona fide!
Hi, Byron.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Zack, we've got to go.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I want your D.O.R.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Hi, son.
Before that.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Louder!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Want me to get a towel?
I don't want you to move.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
You okay?
That isn't true, is it?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What the fuck is funny about this?
There is not one thing funny here.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Get the fuck away from me.
Fuck!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Could the child please stop that?
That door is a safely hazard.
A what?
Cut it back a little bit.
Makes me nervous.
What's going on?!
Nope.
Are you freaking out?
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
What?
Not an option.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
...Glad you came man.
Now hold on Rodgers...
We're working on that...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
Huh?
What's up with you?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
You alright?
My Mom's at that.
This cool the heat off you any?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
When?
Well?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You got salt last week.
You look well, Charlotte.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You're surrendering.
We did.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
If I fail, you fail.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
A long time ago...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
We saw.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Don't touch him.
It is ended.
Reverend.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Not yet, Thomas.
Seventeen.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
No-I guess not.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Is he really all right?
Because you promised.
I'm not tired!
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But--
Rachel not feeling well?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
Well, honey...you know that...
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
How does he do that?
What's in your head, boy?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
No, I really think I do.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Difficult ... to say.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
That was before I met one, of course.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
You cheated.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Why are brothering with that?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
It's still against the law.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
No, it's not.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Commodore --
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
I know what you're doing.
She says it's not.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Yeah, I do!
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Is that what Argon told you?
Somebody has to.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
That was an egg?
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Just like old times.
Do you have something to bring me down?
What's wrong?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
No cheese.
That's going to fit me?
Who is he?
You saved my life.
You!  I remember you!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Icky!
What do you want?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Impossible. Put it on again.
How's that?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
It has been alleged - yes
Not on my own beat, no.
Why not?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
All right, outside!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
That's a lovely dress.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
The boss is getting hoarse.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Hey, Gallagher!
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Traps shut!
Yes.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Double-strength!
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Yes - the worm!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
But I
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Mary Sue?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
And they won't be able to tell?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Oh, hi ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
What?
You can't go out there.
I told you where I was.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
But where would we go?
Don't! Just let go.
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Lemme see that.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
What did you do?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Those are my friends.
No way.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
So what's the point?
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
So what is it?
Sure.
Are you sure?
What's that like?
You want some berries?
Real rain?
... Like Prince Charming.
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Excuse me?
Because you're coming home.
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
You know what I really like?
What's wrong?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Where are you?
It doesn't matter.
No.
...yes...
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
I'm going to work.
I know but I....how much is it?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Business is good, you're busy?
I saw a picture of you.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
You like her?
Are you learning how to play it?
Oh that's great.
Really?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Where you married?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
No.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How's business?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
You ok?
Good morning, Barry....
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
What happened?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I won't.
I'll see you there.
As soon as you want.
So they'll go.
Hello?
Just tell him to call me.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Marquis? Is that you?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Madeleine --
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Ow!
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
It's no secret that you loved her.
Who's to say I did not?
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
"...your wife."
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Uh-huh
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
Oh, why is that?
There. That's right.
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Hearst?
What are movies about?
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Sorry to disappoint.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Did I ever tell you about my father?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
To do what?
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
This is an abomination There's no music and--
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
It was the best, kid
Oh, no--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
You know?
Answer me when I talk to you.
Go 'head.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Nah, she would never...
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
See? That's all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Screw you, Jack.
How's that?
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Jake...
Now, touch me...  ...here.
I went out.
What'd you see?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
I dunno.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
It don't look right.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Like what?
Hello.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
He and his wife splitting up?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
What are you two talking about?
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Not yet, Jeff.
And your stomach?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Make the one you want.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
What are you getting at?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
From his landlord -- once a month.
Do you like it?
What for?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Friend of yours?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Just him.
What you say your name was?
What's he going to pull--
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Come back tomorrow.
You shouldn't monkey with him.
You scared?
Are you really going to meet them?
It's me!
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
That's swell.  How are you?
No.
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Plato!
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Do I have to spell it out?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
He called me chicken.
Okay--
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Well--we're newlyweds.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
No!
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
That one?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
-- till he fucked his parole --
I've been doing good, though.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
No, c'mon --
Ashley, Jesus --
You sold him out.
Nick died for me....
...maybe I die for Nick...
So does it look a lot different?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
No.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You're not Nick Mason...
Where's she work?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What's her middle name?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
They won't recognize me.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you.  Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Without having them hit the alarms.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
That I should've picked you up?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
Who, Mr. White?
What's this?
But what is this?
What?
I can do that.
Tell me more about Cabot.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
You gonna put it away?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Want a smoke?
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Is that supposed to be funny?
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Yes, ma'am.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Our kind of women?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
But the rest is right.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
I won't have you fighting over me.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
Thanks for taking over.
I found their surrey --
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
What was he in jail for?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Can I have my gun back?
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Yeah, it does.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Half of them are mine.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Suppose I take a look.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Would you like to learn them?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
I found a picture of his wife.
No, I won't let you do it.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
It's coming!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Cindy, what's going on?
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Let's get outta here.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Cindy, let me...
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
Noooo!!!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Did you do that?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Professor, I think you should see this.
Professor, we need to talk.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
You never could feel your legs.
You're not wearing a belt.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
This part removes the sense of humor.
I woke up naked, too.
Hi, Mom.
0h, shit!
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Because it's the rules!
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
In here, Mom...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Hi, Hank.
You bring me such peace...
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
State your name, please.
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
You got your wish.
Beverly, are you alright?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
What was that?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
You know who I am, August?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I don't like this.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
What brought you down here, Greg?
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
You'll be all right?
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
My window - - through which I see the world.
Jason, my pet 
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Perhaps.
Would they hurt her?
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
I'm afraid not.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
That makes it all the more difficult 
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
No, not really.
...free-lance. You know.
This food is excellent.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
That's a good question.
I guess not.
No.
About me?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Interesting analogy.
No, you're not.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Who? Elizabeth?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Goddam right.
Bastard...
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Is he? Strange, I mean?
What are you talking about?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
I just thought it might --
He just asked me questions.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
No, but I did.
I feel like I do.
So what's my share of the dress?
I get real busy between two and four.
The extrovert.
She didn't give you my address?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Your first sexual experience.
Were you disappointed?
Do you like the way I look?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Prettier than Ann?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Who said I was jealous?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
IBM.
One moment.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
You say something?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
What happened?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Yes?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
How's Brad?
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
About Brad's family?
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I'd forgotten.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I want to see Brad.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
And none of them worked?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Are you there? Miles?
Glass or bottle?
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Oh, that's tasty.
Just tell me.
How old's she going to be?
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
What do you smell?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
She what?  When?
Get the trunk.
We're on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Do you like them?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
That's great.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
French or American?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Where's Jack?
Houdini's sick.
I think it's contaminated.
I'm scared.
I see.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Explain, act crazy?
I'm not going to curse.
It was very dark.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Do you feel comforted?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
It's getting stronger.
They're broadcasting...
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
That's good enough for me.
Graham.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What about Isabelle?
What's that?
What about them?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
I gotta be going.
Where you been?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Get out of here, Jake.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
You wanted to see me?
The jury saw it differently.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I got there just short of too late.
I took out thirteen dollars.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Where's the dog now?
What makes you say that?
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
-- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
My two favorite girls.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
You look so, so...
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
No, I'm okay.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
For her?
You can't.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
You have to see her.
Not like this --
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Good-night, Daddy.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Why didn't she thank you?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Do I know you?
Nice boat, Taransky.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Simone, are you there?
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
--My God.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
No.
...No.
Dr. Crowe?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
And you know what else?
A lady. She died.
They?
Dead people?
What are you thinking, Momma?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
What--
Stuttering Stanley!
Good for you.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Come on --
Sounds familiar.
Curt Cobain.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Never heard of it.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Down boy.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
What's wrong?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Suzie --
You're... limping.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Second verse!
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Where are you?!
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Meat.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Where are you going?
You're my princess, aren't you?
Who's that?
Why? You have a bowling date?
An existentialist.
Guess what?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Hey...
Let's hit it.
Kate...
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
But you'll do it?
No.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Why are we doing this?
Bandit I, do you copy?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Do I have a choice?
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
I think you're just yellow.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
He's giving them up?
And this is your car, isn't it?
But there were more of you?
...I forgive you Darwin.
Really?
I'm here, where's the car?
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Do you want me to say I did it?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
My debrief --
You're finished.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Shoot.
No shit.
For real?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Gibarian.
How long can you go without sleep?
What will you say?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
We're taking a flight?
Rheya...
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Where've you been?
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
What are you talking about?
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
Do you want to stay here?
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Chris --
What are you taking?
It's terrific Win.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Right.  That's true.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
He said he'd kill me.
Didn't do very well, did you?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Yeah.
No dog.
No dog.
What about Neil?
What's to like?
Claire?
Where?
What a memory.
I'd miss my life...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
What shit, honey?
She's got to identify him.
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
Ellie...
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
... Hard?
I asked for the man in charge...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Under the table.
What're we having?
Nice threads Dad.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Jesus Christ.
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Good morning, Liz.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
I'll introduce you.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Poison emergency.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Need any more help?
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
No
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
They never caught on.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
You make my mouth water.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
What some brandy?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
It is.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
You were saying --?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
What is this? This is water?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Let me go! Let me go!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Betty! Betty!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Yeah?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
I'll kill you for that!
Which one of us is the informer?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
This is me in Cincinnati.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
It's working.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
That's where he's going.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Data, this isn't the time.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
This is the Nexus?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Well, may we have a look around?
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Oh
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Is there a problem?
Sir, is there anything wrong?
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Count on our help, sir.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Wait! Give me a chance --
Bones!...
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
You amaze me, Commander.
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Say thank you.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
They even killed the galley chief.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
... taking Genesis away from us...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
David --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
I don't mean to intrude.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
No, sir! You'll flood the whole compartment...!
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
A distinct possibility.
... the good of the few...
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Yes.
On screen...
Indeterminate life signs.
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
I can't get power, sir!
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
The question is irrelevant.
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
It doesn't look all that different.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
... I don't think he understands...
What's causing that!?
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You sure you won't change your mind?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Thank you, Admiral.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Status?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Can we make breakaway speed!?
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Full power, sir.
The explosive override -- ?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Professor Scott, if you'll --
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Father...?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Why not...?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
Implants bothering you?
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Counselor?
Initiate launch sequence.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
ATR setting...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Where in the States?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
What makes you say that?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
Life signs?
Captain...?
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Captain?
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What are they doing?
Emergency override!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Even Data?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Uh, Jim...
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Course heading, Captain?
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Your friends are late...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Kronos, sir?
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Captain, our shields -- !
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
WE volunteered?
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
We HAVEN'T fired -
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
How did you - ?
If you are logical.
Direct hit -
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
I do not understand.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
When was he... created?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Data!
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Why?
What purpose does this serve?
What is our approximate distance?
It's you.
No.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
What's he doing?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
It's working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Were we always explorers?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Intruder alert!
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Praetor...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
It's real, George.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
That's the chance we have to take.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Please...
Please.
Please...
Ah... no...
Gear shift.
Dashboard.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Who are you?
Shit.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
I want to try it.
What?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Jennyhaydn.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
It's bad.
You liked my singing?
I will go. But not you.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I don't know where he is.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
You married, Major?
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Bullshit politics.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
He has his uses too.
You were lucky, Max.
You alright?  Y'okay?
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
So there never was a death squad.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
It's alright.  He means it.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
And gives it to you.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
What is it?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Lenny, give them the tape.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Hey, Sheriff.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
What are you...?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
None taken.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
You work with Koessler?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
What's that?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
There are Agency regulations about this.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
And nobody else can do that?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
You okay?
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
What was your weakness, sir?
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Is he dead?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've been to Chicago.
I want to help you.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
No.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I'm Mike.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Oh my God.
You have to lay it on the table.
Why not?
Me too.
I'll be around.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
How's it going? It's been a while...
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Hi.
So I don't call either way.
Well that sucks.
Unless she comes back first.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I'll give you an eight. 
Oh, like that song...
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Don't call me ever again.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
VEGAS.
Wait.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Always.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
Nice, baby.
...Baby...
Which one?
You looked right at her, baby.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
It's not like that...
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
And you?
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
You take care of Paulie?
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
And now, what do you choose to do?
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
I know about what you mean!
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike!  The party starting!
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Jesus, I don't know...
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
They're talking to themselves.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
What will your father say?
Can you say it?
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Tell me!
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
You think I scam?
How do you do.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Who's this?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
You know, a primer.
You like jazz!
What does he say?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Why?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
I never said that!
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
Is he really not here?
Dickie?
What?
It's all true.
So you found Peter...
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
We'll be there.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
My God.
What rumour?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
Tom, are you okay?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Why lie?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Well, we're all working tonight.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
The moon?
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
You must be rich.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Where are you going?
This is sort of high class...
Hello, Travis.
Oh, Tom, please.
Try holding the match like this.
This I gotta see.
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I'm serious, really...
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
For a fee.
Huh?
What's your real name?
What's your real name?
I don't remember.
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
You don't have to.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Twenty-six.
No, I want long shifts.
No.
Is that so?
I'm no cop.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
So howsit?
Wiz?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Like do anything, you know.
Had a close one.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'll go.
You knew?  All this time?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
How'd it go?
That's my girl!  Did you...?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
City hall?
You first.
Nine hundred...
When did you start smoking?
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Delly, shhhhhh...
Yes, sir.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
Nine and-a-half years ago.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
Well...
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Luke... what time is it?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Zackly.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
What is it?
That's where you live.
Jesus.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
You should watch what you say.
Exactly.
Why not?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Then what was it?
And the second?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Are you coming to my party?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
What?
Do you know him?
The two kids?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
She was selling birds.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
They're gone. The same pattern.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
These birds were...
Does this room look silly?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
But how... how do you know my name?
Ouch!
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
Can't see a thing.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
What did it say?
I do different things on different days.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Can we turn back?
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
I don't know why.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm Donald Fettes.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
I don't think I can go on, sir.
We can't be sure of that.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Hear him?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
No.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Fuck! What do you want?
You lied at my trial.
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
I heard you were looking for this.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
... it connects you to me...
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
An accident, Nathan.
Anything wrong?
What were you yelling about?
What? What is it?
Sweetheart...
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Such power exists?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Why not?
But how -- how long--?
No -- no, thanks.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
How do you like Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
Good.
I can't beat a Triumph.
What is this, David?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
David.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Good!
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
He looks dead.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
We are...
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Let's go see them.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Who are you calling?
What's the matter?
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Somebody broke in.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Lighten your load, sucker.  You ain't the judge and executioner around here!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
What we going to do?!
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Spaceship of some kind.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
After all this mess then.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
We're on fire!
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
You jerking off or just pissed?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
What's happened?!
Yeah!
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
We make them see what we wish.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
That was a foolish thing to do.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm tired of running.
Admiration?  My my.
Alex...?!
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Alex... people are staring.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
This... was my home.
Is there a lot of illness?
That machine --
How long ago?
And this is your "work"?
The mud carriers.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Yes, sir, he --
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
No, sir --
"Eloi"?
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
My father has gone to a better place.
Where do they take them?!
You won't even try?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
You ok?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
Relax.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Jackie, go play in the snow.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
I think so.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
I don't understand.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
And if I didn't want to come?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
You told me this was how it happened.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
You want a drink?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Hon.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
We're both fine.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
That's certainly possible.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So how come you don't have any kids?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
You're a bank robber?
Tell me.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Will you at least see how it fits?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
It means shut up, Thelma.
Will I be?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
What happened to your hair?
You're disturbed.
Thelma.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Before.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Ready?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
What?
I said all that?
Shit!
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is that up there?
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Then let's not get caught.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Oh, Jesus!
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Mary again.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
We're in love with your roommate.
Here's the info you asked for.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Don't you want to know my name?
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
A surprise?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Fuck!!
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
All you want is a phone number?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Ho-ly shit.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
How do you guarantee that?
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Have you been up all night again?
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
What's he like?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
What's up, Doc?
You don't think they're too big?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
The prom -- you going?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
What's that?
Sure.
Twenty-two.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
So you're a writer?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Hey.
How are you doing, Warren?
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
Zorin will eat him alive!
My father --
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
The sun came up today.
And the second condition?
John. How much time?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Hey.
Mr. Clear Moon.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
I got one up on ya.
Meet me at base. Over.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
What'd she say?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Alright. Alright...
Tread matches. It's the car.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
What about the water...
Who did?
What?
X21, give me a 20.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
What are you doing on the reservation?
It isn't?
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
You saw a MiG 21?
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
The what?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Yes. I'll give you that!
Lieutenant...
How about what?
I'm different.
You're horrible
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Come on.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
That's not what I hear.
No.
I want it back.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
Now?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
This is crazy!
I'm pulling up.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
I know!
What do you want?
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What was that?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Something bothering you?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
I was a victim of circumstance.
No, we...got our butts kicked.
Hear about Ice?
Who is the best.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
He's a good pilot.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Your sexual orientation?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Amazing.  Where are we?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
They found us!  Everybody out!
Hey, Quaid!
Harry, what the hell is this?
Look at this shit.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
The hell you're not.
I love you.
I give up.
Secret agent...How much is that?
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
...What?
Why would I lie to you?
I think you better leave.
I'm not falling for it.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
We're not going over there, right?
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Well, folks, what's the plan?
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Yeah...but no ties.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Ready?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
What's it doing?
It worked!  There they go!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
...Where're we goin'?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
I noticed.
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
You see that? You wanna be like that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
-- an angel dust dealer --
-- a speed manufacturer --
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
That DD-5.
Eddie Dowd.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
Murder witness.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I haven't paid you.
-- About what?
No.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
I don't think I know that name.
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
And why was an exception made?
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
No.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
He's dead -- good and dead.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
I see. He does talk loud.
You better dust this place, Sam.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
It does matter. We're in love.
What do you mean?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
You're getting warmer.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Josie, I think we should go public.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Leland, what are you doing?
I don't know.
What did he find?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
You know what that would mean?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
We went to Code Blue...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Are you done?
I'm a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Pardon?
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
...You saw her?
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You got a good memory, Franky.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
She told me.
What?
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
I do know him...slightly.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
They've all stopped at the same time.
The troops are certainly moving in here!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Is that... machine...?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
What was it like?
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Must be somebody in there.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
What's up?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Like Freddy.
Diabetes?
Like what?
What?
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
This is going to give you nightmares.
Tomorrow night.
You okay, champ?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
Dylan, where's the man?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
In what, a romantic comedy?
You're not crazy, by the way.
You didn't jump in.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
Studio B.
Captured?  How?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
No, not really.  I...
Robert?  I...
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
She isn't that old.
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
I couldn't have done it without you.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Why then.
Why'd you do it?
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
But that's not the point...
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
How ya doing?
No way!
So... What happened?
It works?
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Is that what you were trained to do?
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
What is it we can do for you today?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Me, too.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
It's outta here!
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
For killing a dolphin.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Y'all take American Express?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Need a hand?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Whattaya mean family?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Why should it?
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
What?
What is it, Johnnie?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
You're perfect for me, too.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
What was this one?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
How'd you know my daddy?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
It's a comfortin' idea.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
It's okay by me, peanut.
I mean tomorrow.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
You must be my son.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Just tell me what you want.
Where?
Through the forehead?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
It's the Chancellor.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
That was good.
You stay there.
James? My James? What's happened?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Such as.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Me? What can I do?
You peeked, didn't you?
How are you -- is it Joe?
No...
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
Vernon.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
You cold, James?
Is that really it?
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Afraid so.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
The one that left you?
It feels really... good... here.
I just wanted a little sip.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
So, why did you take me up there?
But, last night...
Where you going?
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
But where? I need the street.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
Professor Tripp.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Pow.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
The more the merrier.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Who's that guy?
Where's Emily, Hank?
Where you stand?
No, the dog.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
What's happening?
What party?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You don't know?
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
It's not for sale.
Too much sun.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You knew her?
You don't know?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I wasn't feeling well.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
So. How are you adjusting?
And your new apartment?
I'd keep away from him.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
What?
Yes.
What's her name?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I don't understand.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
That's right.
It's very good, indeed.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
Do you think you're crazy?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Who do you see?
What the hell are you doing there?
Don't ever do that again.
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
What else?
You plan to drink both those beers?
Hey, that was... intense.
I thought I'd stay the night.
It's not what you think.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
I've changed.
They seduce you?
All three -- in chronological order.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Nice shot, Lins.
Lord Almighty.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I think you were worried about me.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine.  Be that way.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Alright, put this on.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
It is insane.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Virgil?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
4800 feet.  It's official.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
Which one shall I wear?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Well?
Don't be so humble.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Are you feeling better?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
That's why I asked you...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
No, Sandro... Please...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
But where did you finally end up?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
And what are we going to do now?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
We have a radio like this, too.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
But she watches... she listens.
I'm not hungry.
Of God.
I don't know.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
For what?
Let's talk about something else.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Something I ate.
I fell asleep.
From their heads...
Don't you know?
Why not?
Why should I?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What did you do?
What did you do?
She's dead isn't she?
That you're a mistake?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
I'm frightened.
Of telling you.
How did you have a baby?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
Why isn't anyone coming?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Not your fault...
Larry...
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
???
No!
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Marie's dead Mama.
Could there have been anyone else?
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
You hate us don't you?
I'm only interested...
Oh, Dear God...
Do you know what she did to her?
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
I haven't decided yet.
Her spiritual health.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
Why must he be anybody?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Was it you?
You tied the cord around its neck.
Before or after you killed the child?
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Nine.
Eight and two thirds.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Can you fix him for me?
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
Are you going in?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Grotty?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Well ... come on.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
And what do you do about it?
Ah.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
A book!
What are you doing?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Yeah ... so what?
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Anything to spare?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Let's go and muck in.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Let's have you.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
Well!
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
What do you think are you're up to?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
What is he?
Engines off.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Activate lifter quads.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Are you okay in there?
Yes!
Okay.
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
Where did it come from?
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Yes?
<u>How</u>?
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
Receiving.
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Oh my God.
Yeah, okay. 
Martin?
What film?
Where did the parasites come from?
Take us up.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
We won't need it then.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
It's a rhino.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Are you alright?
I found it...
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Not yet.
How much air-time have I got?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Alright, okay.  Look...
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Already working on it.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
Aren't you?
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Because I don't want to.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
How... how was Miss Caswell?
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
Macbeth.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Nothing?
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
You in a hurry?
Many happy returns of the day...
She did...?
Need any help?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
So she seems.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The audition.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Why?
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
- and for you.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
She works hard.
Late for what?
It was for my report.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
How long does it take?
I think she would cheer.
May I have your coat?
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Addison wants me to play it.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
I've got it.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
How was the concert?
Margo, again...
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
What time is it?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
I'm glad Bill's back.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Don't be evasive.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
To you, too?
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Yes, sir.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
"Liebestraum."
Anything to help you out, Max.
--it was fine the way it was--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
--I'm trying--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
What would you have done?
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I'll never get out of here in time.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
No games, Irwin; give.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
But they both worked at the White House?
Right.
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
I got Clawsen on hold--
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
They are not my clients.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
--which Young?
Mr. Sloan?
Does "they" mean the White House?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
All right, I got some scotch.
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Not bad, Chris.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Nice car.
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
You want onions?
You're missing the game for us?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Give it to me!  Yes!
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Can I come in?
Dad!!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Yes.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
So you need to change, right?
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Feeling better, Oz?
So does your tongue cramp up?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
NOVA!!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Really?
Merde! Just missed!
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Oh God. Shit...
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
You recognize her?
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Why would he pick this one?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Enough. Cut him loose.
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Here.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Did I tell you that?
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Why do you want to go to Paris?
By pulling my hair?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
What a beautiful ship!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Nervous?
I'm so scared...
No! Well, yes, but
Dmitri didn't want the money?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Trust me, it's her!
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
What was that?
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
She does.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Yes.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Two minutes, Alvy.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
So sorry.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
it's my first time.
Hey, listen, listen.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
We can digest our-
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Hey?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Yes, it is.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
What's- It's me, open up.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Very big spider.
Yeah?
God, it's so clean out here.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
What?
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
Oh!
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Here you are. There's people out there.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
What-
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Forget it, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yeah, watch the road!
I have some very good memories there.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
M'mmm.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
It has your ring.
Isn't Skye amazing?
She's a constant surprise.
The movie.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Why didn't you bring him?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Let's get the kids.
Would you leave us alone right now?
I'm the hired help.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
Oh.  You're them.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Whatever you say.
Yes.
Don't get it.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
It's an unfair advantage.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
And how hard it hit?
Don't.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Yes.
Yes I did.
Joking.
Ah.
Sally did all this herself?
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Easy tiger.
Scout's honor.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
I...
Is there space here?
That was my clue.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Panes is here!
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Why not?
So tell me, how's it going?
You don't need to do that.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
What do you mean, thank God?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
You're right!
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Worker!  Come back here now!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Come on, Z.
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
Who is that idiot?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Wear this.
Yeah, I know.
So this is your mother's apartment?
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
You mean tonight?
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I forgive you.
One more?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
Too slow?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
You are?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
What are you doing with that?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Are we dressing for dinner?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Are you all right?
Mind if I come in?
Last night?
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Oh.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You left your wife?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Hi, Baxter.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
Family?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Sleeping pills.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We need all our fuel anyway.
Winning the war by yourself.
North ?
Sometimes.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Holy shit.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
A sauciere --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
What are we doing here?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
What the hell is it?
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
What cat  ?
I never heard about that.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
I thought he was a lame.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Don't you agree?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
You were not coming here, to see me?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
Do you?
I think think a lie stinks.
Yes...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
You hear it again?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
215  CONTINUED:
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
27   CONTINUED:
What are you doing?
Stay here.
Did you catch Corbett?
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Where's Corbett?
Leave it here.
Desmond.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Does he have people?
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Told you I'm fine!
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Don't push me..!
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
You better get some sleep.
Neff, you know better than this...
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Call me as soon as you're settled.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
Sorry.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Why did yo do this for me?
So you'll be at work?
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Grouchy?
I wasn't asleep!!
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Good night.
I've got to sketch you.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
She's nice.
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Yeeeess!!!
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Would you leave now, please?
I told you to go on in.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
What's wrong?
So you're practically finished, huh?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Uh, Fontella's
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Okay.
Five million dollars?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Bullshit.
Nikita?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
Because I'm done.
I killed him.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
My first take?
They become complicated... messy.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you have a passport?
Hey, where are you?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Really?
How was the beach?
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I told you, he will.
What did he say?
Do you have ulcers?
What are you doing?
Can I ask you something?
Who was she?
Martin.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
You're very good at this aren't you?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
I think I've heard of you.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
This will take some time.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Fifteen crowns.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
And put it on expenses?
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Well, don't get carried away.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Need any disks?
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Like a hand?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
It's...42 56 76 .
Yeah, pretty well.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
They'll do it.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
What's the Bugler?
Is it dry?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Where did you steal the car?
Enjoying our hospitality?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
What is it you want?
Would you like your things now?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Sure!
You are quite sure it's secure?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
She's coming over here...
You saw him?
Were you with Jamie?
I told him to leave me alone.
I'm thinking.
Don't call him a dipshit.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
You.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
The play's going to be really good.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
I haven't been nice to you.
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Before we do this.
Assholes. This happen to you?
What's wr--?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Now? We just --
I've talked to your father.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
You know about this stuff?
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Shall I give you a few ideas?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
How old are you?
Hi, Marty.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
A gold mine?
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Well, Professor, are you sure you want me to tell you? You know, changing the course of history and all....
You answered the door!
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
You didn't?
Obviously!  
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Gone?... Where?
How you doing, Cato?
What you been doing?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Does he bite?
We did it, Ray.
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Well, Kit...
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Can I be honest?
Nothing.
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
You want to go for a ride?
Is that all there is to it?
Don't call me stupid.
I can look and see.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Think I got 'em?
Don't.
That's Montana over there.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
What's that?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Got a casualty list?
Raise your hand...where?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Was she pretty?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
Chet!
How long you been up there, Fink?
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
A souse!
I don't understand-
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
I hope these are your shoes.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
Yeah, but 
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Why don't we go to your room-
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Okay
L.A.P.D.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
Take care, you hear?
You okay?
What is this interest you've got in her?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
I had him in two classes.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Do you have a cigarette?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
But you didn't hurt --
Because you didn't love him --
Sure.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Why does he do it?
When did you write it?
Why take the risk?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
What did he say?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Did you ever tie him up?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Was she ever a suspect?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Maybe the maid did it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
How old was she when this happened?
When's your show?
What do you think?
Saddle River, New York!
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
I'm not black.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
You want me to put it here?
Blue? Where?
I'm your family.
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
That one's for you.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
You don't have any!!!
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
OK! Goodbye!
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
Admiring your handiwork?
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
I'm listed.
Pouring myself into my work.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
And the truth frightened her?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
No.  No glass on the inside.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Y'mean frame him?
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Ten, nine...
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Working late?  I'm touched.
And a very, very good one.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
Women.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
What is it?
I'm on break from-
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Crimefighter's rule number two.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Impressive
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
Scholarly research?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
How are you feeling, young man?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
All the answers are numbers.
He's home. I sent the signal.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
So glad you could come.
To kill me.
Find anything interesting?
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
...Not the bat?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
I'll show you it works.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
How'd you find us?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
Where's the boy?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Look! Police!
Please.
Is this what you wanted?
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Do you sail?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Got it!
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
That's it?
... Thank you.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Where does one man get all this junk?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Alexander... I know you.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Not what?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
HOLY SHIT!!
There were three strawberries.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Hi,
shhh...
Goodnight Annie.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Howls he getting on with the family?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
David, David, David ...
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Of course.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
What's gone?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Uh... bye-bye.
You already said that, Butt-Head.
They perk me right up.
...Two...
Talk ta me, Bork.
Do her? Huh huh.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Who sent ya?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
That little girl saw us.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Here's something.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Nobody else can.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Wait for who?
All right.  Who are you?
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
He's your cousin.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
They're... not here anymore.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
What's wrong?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Hellooo!  How's school?
They don't want to come down.
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I would like to watch television.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
What is that?
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
I feel very good in here.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... That is a very small room.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Since you were a child?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
Yes. I will.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
No headaches?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... How are the kids getting along?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... Would you take me on a tour?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Morning.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Now?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Why aren't you at work?
So how was it? What was he doing?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
People make mistakes.
So how was it?
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
No.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Is that true?
What'll you have?
That's the usual?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
You're late.
You're glowing again.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Thank you, Floris.
Do you dream often?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
No! Don't harm the vessel!
When?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
How'd you get this number?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Stay in him forever?
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
WILL YOU STAY?
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
You on your way home?
What you want'em for?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Be here. In case.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Mama let me help you.
I know what I see.
Can't locate him.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
You planning to do anything about it?
Sethe?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Where'd she been?
The Gundersons.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Yeah.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
They range up to three thousand.
Yeah.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Am I wrong?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
I like your style, Dude.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Which one was Logjammin'?
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Theodore Herzel.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Huh.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Thanks Walter.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Shit yeah!
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
There weren't any shots.
Dude here.
Dude.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
'Scuse me?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Shit, sorry man.
You come all the way down here to roust--
What?
What was that?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
What do you want me to do?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Nomak?
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Going on twenty years now.
She's been bitten.
What took you so long?
You're not going anywhere.
Who dies first?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
But he's a policeman --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What am I injecting you with?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
-- tearing me -- apart.
No --
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
You're a monster.
Who are you people?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
Try, please, Anna--
What do you mean?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--how old?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
So says her website.
Then I'm going--
I want to see something!
--hours before--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
This is a little nuts.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
<u>What</u>?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
Let's get inside.
What--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
She got <u>paid</u>.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
What?
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Heather.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
She's far from "fine."
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Ray?
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Ray?... What time is it?
...You all right?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
So how long have you know Meurice?
Sign.
Yeah.
...Anything else?
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Well what?
Yeah...
Dead, huh?
...Count it if you want.
Thanks Meurice.
...Why?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
What day is it today, Angie?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Can I feel 'em?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Do you like talk like that?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
Yes.
You don't?
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Hi. can I come in?
. I. uh.
Look.
Who is Don?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'm glad you do.
Yeah, it's me.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
So. what's next?
What's the plan.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Yeah?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
What am I going to do?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
You worry about me really?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Hi Dad.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Well.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
What are watchin' this junk for?
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Nothing like this back home.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
I don't think so.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Mexico.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Yeah, maybe.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
You mad at me?
Figured it out.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Hello.
I don't know.  My name is George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Hey, George.  You okay?
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I swear.  On my life.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Yeah?
So?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
What ... What must I decide?
With an unloaded pistol?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Go away!
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You did a good job, Charlie.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
So she knew about his heart?
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Why not?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Why?
Did you suggest any?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
No.
Did he make your life miserable?
What did he say?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
I've tried it.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Something like that.
Can we get out of here?
Sorry.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Can I see you later?
What's that for?
You killed him -- didn't you?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
I love you.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
The witness will answer the question.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
Please -- not now.
I don't know.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Madge?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I doubt that.
Is the dizziness gone?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Help cook?
Smells like dirt.
When?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Take me somewhere.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Why do you say that?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
What are you doing?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
I don't know. Please...
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Where you going?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Franny?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Where's the others?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
We can climb out.
Is this Hell?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
We'll have to sneak in.
What else does she say?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
I can't.  Not yet.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
No way man...
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You gotta use your imagination.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
The money!
No, Gino!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
I didn't expect --
So, you just got out?
It's impossible!
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
I need you ...
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Stupid cunt!
Not on duty, sorry.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Another time.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Truck.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
...  I needed that.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What you heard wasn't sex.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
What happened?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
okay, all right.
Hey.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I know you will.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
Are you Treadstone?
Jason Bourne is dead.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Paris?
You are a friend of his?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
Okay, so you're a victim.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
And that's it?
Can I help you?
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
What the hell're you talking about?
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
...ervices.
You telephone, sir.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Jack!!
Enough though, eh?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
It could all be coincidental.
Yes we have, Jack!
What's going on here?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
What?
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Don't you like parties?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
You want to take my console into your office?
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Sam!!! 
What have you done with his body?
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Whatever happened to you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
She asked me to pick her up.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Is this what you gave Mary?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
You're not going to die.
Here, you try.
Is there any chance?
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
I think this place stinks.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
He's better, isn't he?
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Not as good as Nino's.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
This is not a good time.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
The family know?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Faster! God!
You're in the stomach!
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Shut up a second...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Hold it down, okay?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Of course.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Do others feel that you did well?
Then what was good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Yes.
So who's the guy?
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Just a few questions?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
What did he say?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Yes.
No.  Were you going to you?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
That's not it.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Where's the bathroom?
What are you doing here?
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Walter can I ask you something?
Hi Walter.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Man this is heavy!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
What's wrong with you!?!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
No, we didn't.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Wheels?
Which way did she go?
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
You broke up with my machine?
How are you doing?
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Dress, huh?  What for?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I crashed your party.
Are you okay?
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Am I in trouble or something?
Why?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Time to do what?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Ow.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
What?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Uh... gym.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
No -- you don't have to --
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
Five?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
All right.
Football is my life.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
I haven't seen him tonight.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Omniplex?
I never thought of that.
Cool!
The homelesses?
And the January Semi-formal --
No...  You want me to give him a message?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Just till I lose.
Well I guess this is it.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
Don't tell anybody.
Your place or mine?
He' s confused--
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
You're a great catcher.
No.
I'd kill ya.
Don't try me.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Struck out eighteen...
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
What the hell's going on out there?
What'you want, kid?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
Stop -
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
She's not here, Sam.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
No, of course not.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
In other words, I'm fucked.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
How'd you know I was here?
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
You've got to stop her.
...position...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
This woman's an institution.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Okay, thank you for asking.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You sure?
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
Hello.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Yeah.
So, what'd ya do with it?
You're lower than a dog!
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
I am not!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
...worst possible time for me.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
You just - Just stop him.
Come on. I'm sorry.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Leave me alone!
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Oh.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Uh-huh. Good.
Sure.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yes, you did.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Well, how 'bout that?
I'm always here for you.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Come here, come here.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Don't know.
Whoa. Calm down.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Frankie!
You're a little confused?
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
What's the matter...
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Pass!
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Hello, Spooky.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
Let's have your license, mister.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
You switched license plates?
And stop with the directions.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Oh won't I?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Who?
Stop throwing names at me.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Tell me what she looks like.
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
What's happening?
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
Do you know what's in that box?
It won't be him.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
What did you do?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
I'm still okay.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Pass.
Sure.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
It's in the process.
Stop the crying.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who's this?
What does it take to kill you?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
I'm in awe.
Why are you picking on me for?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
He agreed that he was.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
You fucking promised.
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
Who?
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Would you like a drink?
No.
I think you do.
Do I?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Drink.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Tell him it hurt --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Come on.
Dil, this is Jude.
She own you, Jimmy?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You want another haircut, baby?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
You heard what I said, Dil?
What?
Died...
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Why?
You do?
And you'll never leave me?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Lucky you.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
So what do you need, Fergus?
See does he want some.
So you did fuck up.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
So?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Back in a minute, Jody
Why do you want to do that for?
He's at home.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
What makes you think that?
I'm not a gambling man.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
She'd be anyone's type.
Never.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Who's Dil?
Help me.
Not here.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
No -- I guess not.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Where's that airlines bag?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Steal it how?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
It's Charles!
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
How long do you intend -- ?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Who told you to do that?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
You loved him?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
I don't understand.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
How's that?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
What are you doing here?
Where did everything go?
Come on. You can't stay here.
What's going on?
En garde.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
On the street where you live.
Peter -- are you all right?
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Who is it from?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Yeah? What's that?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
She's my daughter, Tom.
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
You're grounded Friday night!
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
What do you mean?
Who is she Daddy?
Did you warn her?
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
I know where you're going.
Your brother told us.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Oh nice save.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Cut it out.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Jody. Wait.
My dad's down there!
Where are you going?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
Yes.
Yes?
You ok?
Hide your laptop here.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
help me get in the truck. 
 Oh...
Come on, Night Shift.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since when does...
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
All right, then how about this?
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
...fine.
What?
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...I'm not the psycho.
You wanna hit me?
I did not steal the truck.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Shut up!
 Listen!  Listen...
Oh, shit!
Oh, no!
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Listen, Arlo.
They're movin'.
We're gonna die!
Oh.
Yeah.
 All right.  Okay.
Oh, shit.
We!
What?
Stop limpin' around like that.
You.
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
No.
I feel faint.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
We're worried...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
But...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Yes, sir.
...-lar.
"I am become Death, the...
Mm-hm.
All right.  After they put you away...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
I wanna patch in from...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Assumptions are always...
 Two pots of coffee...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
A man named Tim Ma-...
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...fishin'.
Where are you now...
Lying? 
...side!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
Don't move!
  All right.
Arlo.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
An honest living.
Then these are all new owners?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
They're calling it an accident.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Very.
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Just find the girl.
Avocado groves?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
Off the alley.
Thanks, Lou.
Looking for someone.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
A complete surprise?
What?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Mr. Gittes.
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Over the water department, or over you?
What are you thinking?
It was in Chinatown.
...No. Why was it.
And I want to know where.
Upstairs. Why?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Let me handle that.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
The obituary column?
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
The water.
Of course not.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
How did they get it away from him?
So he says you sent them?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Thanks for all you've done for me.
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
Hi, Elena!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
Is it good?
We haven't heard from him.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
Oh yes, there is.
Where's the soap?
Would you sing for me?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I mean in New York.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Goodbye, Charlie.
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Why not?
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Hello, Brad.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Are you sure?
Unnhh!
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
Hey, now wait a sec...
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Well... kind of, sort of?
No.
Was I right?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
You don't have anything to do with it.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
He's not invited.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
You open?
What smells like shoe polish?
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
She called me.
You win.
Seven months.
Five years.
Eight and a half.
She called me Brad.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
She's in here?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Pull my laces tighter.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Shit. What about tomorrow?
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
May I be blunt with you?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
Get to work.
No way!
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy to get a fine?
What did she say?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
You just fucked a total stranger?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
You should shit or get off the pot.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
How do you figure?
Like ten after.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Do you work tomorrow?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
You know him?
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Go open the video store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
You calling me a liar?
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
How many girls have you slept with?
Where?
Shit! Why are we getting up?
What do you mean?
He requested this?
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
I feel sick.
What is it?
It stings a little.
You open?
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I didn't do that!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Check this out, he's from Russia.
I do about three-fifty, four.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
To an Asian design major.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
That's the price, my brother.
I... I don't know what to say.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
The guy ain't here yet.
I have first dibs.
A monkey?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Take the gun.
You can stop right there.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I don't understand?
Where?
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
Remember the first time we came up here?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Gabe!
Reach up!  Do it!
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
You said there was a way across.
I don't know about totally.
I don't trust him.
Man against nature, right Travers.
He's alive!
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Appreciate it.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Been punished, yeah?
Much better, thank you, sir.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Do you feel that way now?
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Good.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Surprise?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Fine, fine.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Crime?
Religion?
Brown hair, is it?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
What's all this about sin?
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I've done my best, have I not?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Moloko-plus.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
How many to a cell?
The ride is free.
Like what?
You need a vacation.
Max, the cab driver!
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Remember what you played?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Lay it on me.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I was with Max when he got the call.
It's nothing.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
You hassling my driver again?
He'll keep calling.
Yeah?  So?
...why is everything always about you...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
You on some kind of work plan?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You - you killed him?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Music.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Let him go, Vincent.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
How long have you been a hit man?
Paid sick leave?
It's what I do for a living.
Head towards Union Station.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Look, I'm sorry --
Saved you last night's, too.
Not for years.
You think I'm crazy.
What was your horse's name?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Yes.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
If my universe had a hub...
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Who are you, Jerry?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
Now what?
How did you know?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
And you feel bad for it?
And you have no idea where he lives?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Where'd you get it?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Which way did he go?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
What gave me away?
He died...  ... in 1972.
What in the hell...?
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
What does it say?
Got a bogey, boss?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Talk to him.
Could we hear to the moon?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Am I one... or many?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
What day?
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
Do you love your parents?
Did you love him?
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
Ellie --
What?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
But I made this arrangement --
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
No.
Here's the Patrol.
Whatcha got?
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink? Okay?
Somebody say somethin'?
Well, whatta we got here?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Man Oh Man.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
I want to die.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
I thought he was lying.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
The door was already open...
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Would you want to work with us on this?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
We'll show that to...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Are you always so bold?
The lock...
Yes.
You know how to use this?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
We could use a little help.
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
Where you going?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Where's the car?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
What kind of place is this?
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
Maybe.
Hi, Mom.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
Will you get time off to do that?
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
Letty, you should be in bed.
A while, I guess.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Don't take it personally.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
It's TV heaven.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
What are we going to do?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
Yeah.
Getting back.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
What are you doing?
They left about a half hour ago.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Hello?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
What kind of business?
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Because you're the closest.
Why is everything an argument with you?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
You're sure?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Anybody hungry?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Yeah, French guys from France.
There has to be.
They don't serve wine here.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
How's my brother?
What happened?
Mr. Zammito?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
And how do we do that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Did she break your heart?
She seems pleasant enough.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Why do you want to teach me?
And if I use them to kill you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Put them down.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Don't send me back!
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Save your strength.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
And you're gonna tell me who.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
My name.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
Do you feel okay.
You gotta go now, I bet.
Well, how's your friend?
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
You'll be alone.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
You need help.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
How's the water?
You're naked.
It was fine.
You don't even know me.
That's none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
What?
I don't.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Lighten up.
Am I bothering you?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Please don't go.
Would you like a tour?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Outstanding.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
What year are you in?
Excellent.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
I was just kidding.
Want to join me?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Don't you want to change that?
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Whoa!
Yes!
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Hello.
Yeah?
What's wrong?
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Why not?
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What's wrong with you?
I'm at your service.
Any day now.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Shut up.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
It clearly is why.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
The Farren house
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
Ollie.
What's funny?
That's the Farren house.
These are all from me.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Can't you get it, darling?
Oh, how beautiful!
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
What?
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Let the child stay.
Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Wow your body's really hot.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
He's a very talented musician.
Or if there's a full moon.
Are those Mark's?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
You hungry?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
It's a matter of life and death.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Mark.
The Nielson's?
Script coverage?
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
I really gotta get going.
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
What happened?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Your breasts feel larger.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
You at least owe me the truth.
Peter I love you too but...
Be careful!
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
I ate a guy last night.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
He was found a few blocks away.
What?
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
He means the last that we know of.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
You think mafia hit?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
How long have you been here?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Lost something?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Im your new assistant.
You wont regret this, sir.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Someones after me.
Dont kill me!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
How much do you usually get paid?
That shelter was in this bill.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Nobody's got clean kids.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
It's not his job -- It's my job!
What do you mean by that?
Uh-oh...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
Yeah.
You ever think back to how you started.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
You're leaving?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
It was okay?
I know. I'm sorry...
You really believe that?
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
What is it?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Step up here, Tyler.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
It will?  How do you figure?
What do you mean you don't know?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yeah?  Like what?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Who else was involved in this?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
What happened? Were you kicked out?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
What?
I've found it.
So?
Come on, that's impossible.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Who are you?
It's not going to help us!
Right here...middle of nowhere...
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Maybe we lost them.
The "come back" kind.
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Let's just keep going.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...it's okay...
It's okay...come on...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
What was that?
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked us both.
Ammo! Get the ammo!
They did too!
What the --!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Let's go!!!
Whee-uu!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Fucking A.
He's real bad, Nick.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Holy shit!
Hey, Nick...
Not so good.
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
What?
Okay.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
We gotta play with more bullets.
No way. No fucking way!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Did you get one?
You didn't get a deer?
Where?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
No!
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
The fuck I did!!!
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Up I would say... What would you say?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Yeah?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
I'm ready.
See those guys?
Hey, I'm eating.
You want to be a good detective?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
How do I look?
No.  I want to be with you.
Seat's too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Gee -- that Fair --
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Mama!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
What do you want?
Stevens!
Mornin', Jabez ...
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
What's the matter with you?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
No, no! Give it to me!
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Jabez -- help!
Mary -- it's gone.
We must go on home, Jabez.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Mary! Come back ...
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Me?
I can't be honest with them.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
What's happening?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
Where are you going?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Three down, four to go --
Encourage them to be bolder.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Is that him?
This is --
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I know!
What am I supposed to do?
So!  Sal is with you?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
It's my only chance!
You try calling the police?
He's makin' threats in there.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
How many you got in there?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
What?
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
You tryin' to fuck me?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
Where's the back door?
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
Are you a lawyer?
Thanks again, Sam.
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
We won't have to.
He wants one.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
What's wrong?
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Not now, Mom, please.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
This is Drake Bishop.
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Morning.
What is it, Choco?
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Yes.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
Hello?
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
Not really.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
How you be?
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
I'm gonna leave now.
What did he do this time?
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
You the man.
It's been about a year.
You're a drunk fool.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Jade.
Hurry up and get dressed.
No.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
I'll do.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
How many you say?
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Can you pay me now?
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
C'mon, Sal.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Tina, you are too slick.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
What else?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
How do you know this?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Then we could try something else.
How ya doin', Mookie?
You're it.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
O'clock?
Would you like something to drink?
Just down the hall.
Okay.
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Who's Principal Collins?
One day they'll find a cure.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I will stop this car right now.
I didn't know that.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
If you have to ask, you don't know.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Ready Lloyd?
Guys, this is much better.
What?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
So can I come along?
I thought I told you to get lost.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
What are you doing here?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
What happens now?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Yes, Sire.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Remove her gag!
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Long live the fighters!
THE PAIN!
You mustn't speak of...
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Let me take you to the hospital.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
H-how'd you know?!
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
It takes me comfortable.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Goddamn landlord.
That's right...
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Mr. Wood?!
Tor, I should be getting home.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
What are you making?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
I can't get it to go up.
Huh?!
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
I'm really sorry...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
What the heck is THIS?!!
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Uh-huh?
Yeah.
Ed --
He's who we want to go with.
Take him off the air.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Al!
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Yes.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
You do though, you look great.
Go!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Um...
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Twenty-nine.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I need to talk.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Kinda'.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
What's up?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
All right.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
... Ray?
Look, we gotta talk.
No -- keep it.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Hi.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
What d'you got?
Mostly Tammy fans
Tracy.
NO, that's fine
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Hello, Mr. M.
Where to?
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
What is it. Tammy?
points at the motel.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Yeah.  I'm here.
And she's super-nice
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
I mean at you.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Hell, good luck!
How's the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
But you did it anyway.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Anything?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
You're the key witness?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Where will you go?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Do you have any proof?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
My daughter was a virgin!
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
You're back, boychick.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Working whores with squad two.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
Same thing?
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Feeling lucky?
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Do you see anything you like?
That's my point.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Uh-oh.
Bobby?
Sorry.
It's not true.
I've seen it.
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know, but listen--
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
Do you like fish?
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
How can I be sure.
Rachel--
I can't.
This conversation's over.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Hey!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Robert--
Who would do that?
I don't under--
Who won the fight?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
Yes.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
What does that have to do with you?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What about the tapes?
Yes sir.
No sir.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
How'd you get in the building?
No thank you.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Now is that clear?
That insults them.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
You felt obliged to.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Will you not come in?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
What do you hate most?
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
It hurts too much.
You're wearing the thimble.
Don't leave me!
Shall we be all right?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
What kind of photographs?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Which we've overflown twice.
Why do they care about our maps?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Where did you find that?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Could I have a cigarette?
He needn't disturb you.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
I'll probably marry him.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
And what if he really is a spy?
He's gone, hasn't he?
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Certainly not.
I'll come with you.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
And the draft blew over the flowers.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I have a question...
I can't?
Mr. MacDougal.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Are you...okay?
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Fine. What do I do?
It's a fake.
You stole my luggage? You--
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
I didn't mean to get personal.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
He wasn't.
One, two, three...
We're living history here.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
The eight billion. From them to us.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Got it.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Parachute.
Four billion dollars.
He looks familiar.
Gin, really.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Right.
You look like George Washington.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Tony Marvin.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Jesus.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Yeah?
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
I didn't see any medical records in there.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
At least they made an offer.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Hey.  I like working with you.
What kind of truck?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
What's a demur?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Ho - ly - shit.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
When'd they file the demur?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Can I play roller hockey?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
That's Ed.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
What time is it?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Dr. Paulsen?
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Well, it's been awhile.
Give me that!
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
That's right.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
You, too, golden rod.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Stop that.
You look silly.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
How's your mining operation going?
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
It's a lovely outpost.
What'd you say?
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Price?  What do you mean?
Ben?  Ben?
They're my friends.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
The Hoth System?
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Primitive?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Ooww!
Oh Cuervo...
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Defense against what?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Got a smoke?
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Where are they?
Where is it?
Cease fire with the bullshit.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Is that what I think it is?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
How do we get out of here?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Perceval, you have returned!
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Who is Merlin?
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Yes.
Who is, then?
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Who?!
Me?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
It is.
A lovestruck page!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
And you got an invitation.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
It's serious?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Morning.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
A stimulant.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
He didn't mention?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Wanna drink.
Where's Regan's father?
Have you told him what's happening?
Oh look at that.
Captain who?
Who's Captain Howdy?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Oh my God!
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Lieutenant?
Do you like films?
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You'd like that?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
I'm all right.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
No.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Amen.
Really?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Are you comfortable Regan?
Is there someone inside you?
Give me the keys.
Twelve years.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Just the same.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Jack.
So we on tomorrow night?
What do you think?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
Your older brother.
I made her nervous.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So you'll come out, right?
Nice, huh?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
I'm not unhappy.
What's that?
What are you, crazy?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Oh, brother.
Make it collect.
Yeah.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Unless you want the right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
You saw wrong.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
The Royal.
Couple years.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Jack, you're on television.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
What?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
How should I take it?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So run a little longer.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
What-?
Where's your dress?
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Save it for your wife.
What do you think?
They're tight.
Oh, thanks.
I don't believe it.
What'd she sing?
Hey, will you look at that?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Fucking.
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Forget it.
Nina?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
So ... ?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Let me get the light.
Guess they're up.
The recent past.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Where am I?
Perfect fit.
Or reactivated the first one.
So?
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
What do you mean?
Now what?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
... That's great.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Excuse me?
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
They did a pretty good job.
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Howd you know my name?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Dont  go, Jack...
Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
What are you doing?
Why not?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
No?
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Our life in a nutshell...
You mean this chocolate cake?
Then say it...just say it to me...!
I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
You really are incredible...
Jack...can we afford all this?
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
Youre so...beautiful...
This place is a perk, Kate.
Youre moving...
You cant go!
Mrs. Peterson.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
Last night was great...
Those yours too?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I had it at four.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
We had a tough year.
Reed? ... Sue?
About me?  How sweet.
What do you want, Vic?
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Then what is it?
How's the IPO?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I can...make it work.
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
I know that. But what's the maximum?
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
A surgeon might...
Such as?
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
How does it look, Doctor?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
You said there was a quick way out!
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I don't believe that.
What happened?
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Can I see your license and registration please?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Huh?
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
They can really take over, that's for sure.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
How ya doin'?
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
but do you know that for sure without -
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Well... yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan and I're okay.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
No, see -
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Yah, that's me.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Yep.
Nope.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Hello?
...Hello?
Linda.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Your mallard?
And his wife?
There's no one else here.
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
We need to talk.
I want brain parasites.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Look, this is a bad time...
I'm just on my way out...
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This could go on for hours.
There?
You feel nothing?
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
When?
You hear that?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
You got about thirty seconds.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
What list?
Don't I?
Yeah.
I don't follow...
What's that?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Same here.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You want to finish her off?
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
What... ?
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
What the hell ... ?!
I'm not asking you to.
I don't know!  Nothing!
What about Marla?
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Did you hear what I just said?!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
What list?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What about that?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
What's going on here?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Whoa, nine months?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
It's only the end of June.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
"It?"
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Most kids do, I guess.
You know what to do.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
Get control of yourself!
What's this?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
This place is a trip.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
What's that?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
You never been in one of those things.
Gawd, you look awful.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
Why's that?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
I do?
That's an order.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long have you been setting up?
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Who're you?
What's your name?
What did you want?
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Yes.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Free?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
But I gave it to you!
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
It's such a great song.
Happily married, probably.
In a bar called Hellfire.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
I never say anything I have to.
No, I...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
You're not going to play it again.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I'm going on over there...
I know you're not.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Sure...
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Sure you don't want anything?
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Maybe you better stay, then.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Like what?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
What have you been doing since then?
Swimming?
What?
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I have to talk to you.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
And what about love?
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Who are you?
That's it?
So what you think of me?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
How does he look up close?
A bad attitude.
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
You sure?
Hey!
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
You're lucky.
Two bs?
Margaret.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Jesus.
What, the heat here?
Are you all right, Doctor?
Read this, please.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
Right.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
He sighs.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
A .357.
Did you hear something?
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
She's cute as a button.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you let me in?
Thanks for the great time.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Who.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
I was afraid you'd say that.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
They just left, sir.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Who?
How gray?
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Not really.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
You okay?
What an interface!
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Gut feeling.
Ouch.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
What's fine?
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Jazz, we're talking here.
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
You're that guy, the private eye.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
What?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Well try, okay?
Sal --
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Twelve o'clock... yes...
It has to be by the end of this week.
Sale boulot.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why not?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Pass.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
Yeah.
What are you saying?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
How was your tour?
Hey, bud.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
No, I don't.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
What?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What's that?
What?
Dad...?
What are you talking about?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
John, you there?
Huh?
You're not looking too good.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Which means he probably knew her.
He ain't our guy, John.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
The 2-3.  Homicide.
No kiddin'?
Why don't we go take a swim?
What're you doing?
Think you can figure it out?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Come on down!
This is too painful to look at.
Faster!  Eat faster!
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
Bullseye!
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
You don't "have to."
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
....with a woman's touch.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Never should've let her play.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
It's all over.
There...Ya happy?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
He didn't say anything?
Yes!
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Look --
Jesus!
Good night, beautiful.
Lock this asshole up.
Does he know about what happened?
It was a community service.
Well?
Don't do anything stupid.
How many times do you want to hear this?
I didn't kill her!
Have you seen Tamara?
What's wrong?
Right.
Did you hear that?
Jason's here in New York.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
What a beautiful day.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
What about you?
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
Guys ready to order?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
And he was there?
He carries a gun.
She died.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
We're able to surprise each other.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Is it?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
See, Daddy.
See, Daddy.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
How come you got the kid with you?
It's a complicated subject.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
This could be it!
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
I hate the Mets.
Why?
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
What's good?
There was a review.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Home.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
Please! You're being foolish!
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
You've done me a great service.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
How much extra?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
That's the last.
We don't have the manpower.
From what budget?
At least it's nothing contagious.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
If you say so.  The stripe.
How was your evening?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
How are you, Jerome?
Why have you done this?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
No bother.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
My medication.  I left it back there.
The doctor will give you something.
The name?  For the certificate.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Feel good?
Where did you get those?
Where did you get them developed?
How was it?
Why are you laughing?
I don't want to go there.
Who's she?
There better be a guy with the
Texas is a big state.
Do you mean that?
You're full of ifs.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
I want to say something.
I don't know.
So what?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Where's home?
Hope you get to where you're going.
All right. Shells?
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Sure am.
You can trust him...
What's the damage?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
What did he say?
You knew what I'd do.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Everyhing go off all right?
Do you?
Yes. I met him last year.
Yes, while he was here.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
How'd you know where I'd be?
Tell me about the girl.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
How's school?
Oh, what you doing now?
You all right now?
Where's that?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, what for?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Nowt.
See you later.
What happened to you, then?
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What about Keith?
Are you awake?
They're friends of mine.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What's it to you anyway?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Not suede boots!
All right. Two hundred.
What's that?
Deadbeats all.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
They did.
They did.
And it's not right to the customers.
That's right?
That's right?
Shoes, boots, yes...
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
We're just "talking" about it.
As an idea.
You didn't?
You're actually talking about this?
Yes.
Fine.
Yes.
He said he filed...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Where were you?
Will you excuse...
Oh, God, I hate this job.
I don't want to go to lunch.
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Who told you...?
Mr. Levene...?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
...no...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Yes.
I will close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
That's alright.
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
Yes.  I hear you.
Mmm.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
It was his idea.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
You did that?
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Fuck you care...?
Harriett...
Glad to meet you.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
I've got to talk to you...
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
She wants her money back.
The deal.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Have a good trip.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Yes.
Do you like them?
On your pillow.
Why do you have to go?
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
That's what I'm here for.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Beautiful.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Me too, Tom?
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
They are everywhere!
What's up?
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Senator Kane.
I'm going to the market.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Enjoy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We'll try.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
It still hurt.  A lot.
Sure.  I loved it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Or would you prefer a beer?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I liked it.  We all did.
No.
Does that surprise you?
What way might that be?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
Are you enjoying yourself?
That only leaves the rest.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
What are you doing here?
Should you be drinking in your condition?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Can that count as one question?
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
My monsters?
How are you?
Fish.
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
I'm just here about my brother.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
Not my girl anymore
What do you want from me?
Where you been, anyway?
okay ...
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
How are we supposed to--
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
What are you doing back?
Why didn't you tell me?
He's in some trouble ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Hey, you want something to eat ?
You don't think so, huh?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
You want me to buy her?
Buy you a drink?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Hey.
You mentioned that in your letters
Whatever do you mean?
You think it can be done?
Some crew you got ...
Okay, then... Otto?
What happened to Sway?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Go inside. I'll be right there.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
We've got to help each other.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Who's gonna do that?
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Give'm a drink.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Where'd you find such creeps?
I gotta go home.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
No way! You're kiddin'!
What do we got?
When's the arraignment?
Who'd you call?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
I guess so.
Okay.
Is that true?
WILL!
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Chuck, let's go.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
You're in a safe place, Will.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Okay. How?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Thank you.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
Hello.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
My kind of background?
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
What do you want to do?
Who is he?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
What?
Tell me what you really think.
Watch your mouth.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
Why not?
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Don't give me you line of shit.
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
No. Thank you.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Oh, you will?
How was that?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
When?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
Want me to take a look?
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Come with me to California.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
What about your twelve brothers?
Ready, Pa?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Lots must a died, too.
Women?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Deputy sheriffs.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
No, I never. What?
And you ain't ashamed?
Think she'll hold?
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Sure do.
What's the matter? What's happened?
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Been doin' a job?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
You people got a lotta nerve.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Ma, you sick?
When?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
Sure. Good-by.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Which ones?
They gone.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
You mean get off my own land?
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Please don't.
You're so funny...
--Stop it--
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
Jesus...
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
How long has it been?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Are you there?
No time.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Not the other way around...?
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Did you see Blank in there?
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
Don't forget your identity.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
God it's great to see you.
It didn't work out.
I have to get my head back into my work.
How did you get this job?
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
I have a way with animals.
Enjoy the day.
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
You missed a button.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
You got everything you need?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
When? Tonight?
Why should they?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Yes?
I have so much to tell you.
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
What choice!!?
Where does this go, Diane?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Tom?
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
It's warmer than I thought.
Jude, you okay?
Did you notice -- no cane?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Shit!
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Very impressive.
Hold on a second!
Snoop onto them...
I want it to have my children!
Did you talk to him?
Dade?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Yes!
It's too much machine for you.
Your slave?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
Thank you.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Ready?
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Die, dickweeds!
What? whatwhatwhat?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
What is he doing in here?
Phreak?
You think they're going to bust us?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Found it.
We should call the fire department.
Why shouldn't I?
Now where are you going?
What the hell did this?
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
What?
I thought you said you were ready.
Jamie, wait for me.
Had enough?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Do you?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Why?
Where's the radio?
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
Well, are we still on for tonight?
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Fancy.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Yes.
Is that all you say?
My parents won't be back till ten.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Anybody live here?
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
You have the wrong feeling.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
TOTALLY!
Okay. Later.
Laurie...
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There WAS.
Right.
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
I'm scared!
There's nothing else I can do.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Ever done anything like this before?
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
That's just --
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Mm-hm.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
We could...we could do that.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Mm-hm.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Page a hundred and twelve.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Elliot!  Don't!
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
This is not an easy situation.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Lee...
It's so late.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Are you?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
So?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
How do you know?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Hmm?
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Yes, please.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Hi.  Where's Holly?
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
That's really nice!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Mh-hm.
Go right over there.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Oh, Hannah!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
I know, no--  I know.
Awwww...
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Can we, can we go?
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Yes, you do recall, right?
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
You're kidding me.
Oh, wow!
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Tch.
Mickey?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah.
Dad...
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
I can't think.
And?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
...are they hard to get?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Why?
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
I'm an orphan.
Give it up.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
If your duty requires it.
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
I've left my <u>program</u>...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...what?
Because...?
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
For approval.
Yes.
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
You think you're so...but you're just...
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
What else don't you believe in?
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Sorry Veronica.
Gee, thanks.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
What do you want from me?
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Probably....
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
You can be so immature!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
The bomb, asshole!
Let's kick his ass.
We on tonight man?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
How was the funeral?
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
 Got an A, Mum!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
I'm educating myself!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
She's terribly hurt . . .
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
Him.
I shall call him Diello.
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Bye, Dad.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Have we met?
That was cold...
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
You're alive...
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Dreams?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Are you ready?
Last week...
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
He gives a good report and I walk?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Nothin'.
I...
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
It's not right, Gale...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Hey, c'mon.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Well, can I make an appointment?
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Baby, what is it?
A man?  Was it a dream?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
So you don't have anything concrete?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
But it's what we want.
He made, you know, a remark.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I thought we'd be happy here.
What -- what are you doing?
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
You?
I'm leaving.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
To ask her to dance.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
I stood up first.
You can go first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
This cannot be.
How comes it your are not afraid?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Aye?
I cannot stay.
Do you love me, Conner?
Then take me with you.
Why are you doing this?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Yes.
Good evening.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
It has to be.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Would you care for some water, Conner?
What are you doing?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
I guess so.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
Jen?  Are you all right?
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Not if they're looking at something else.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Then we might as well die rich.
We're cool.
I'll give you these people.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Donuts here any good?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Mine, too.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Please get away from me.
What happened?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
She didn't answer.
Sounds like you know the job.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
The kids are in here!
Are the disks still in your room?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
He did.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Your police are at the gate?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
The commander is not here.
You have our cards.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Thomas wants advice?
No.
What!
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
A little longer, Paul?
I have to stay.
We have to have a plan.
Can I have your name again?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Looks like we're it.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
What?
Where is it??
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
I'll meet you down there.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
What are you looking for?
This is the best we're gonna do.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
First time for everything.
What is it??
Well, I don't.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Won't do any good.
Price!
For the love of God....please...?
Did you find her?!
Good-bye.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Well then who did?!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
What about all my other stuff?
She's here.
Help me!  Please!!!
I want this one, daddy.
I can't move!
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
What's the matter?
The heater's here.
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
What was she afraid of?
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
What...amulet?
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Something bad.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
Joey?
JP?
I miss you too.
Yes. 53
Oh, I don't ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
The security's actually not that severe.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Remember that shoe you lost...
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Don't I know you...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Something short.
Snappy.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
...Hello?
A sawbuck!
What a horrible little person.
You're from Muncie?!
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
Confused?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
What a beautiful thought.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
You can't print that!
Just got hired today!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Oh, geez.
Geez, I --
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Well, frankly, I...
You're fired.
But --
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
She finds him.
...No money.
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
I wish I hadn't heard --
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Can't I take it for you?
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I told you.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
What about her?
Investigation of what?
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
You all right there?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
I have no idea.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
That this was going to be a key party?
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Hi dad.
Anyone special? You know...
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Talking to me, dad?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
What?
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Who?
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I don't like coffee.
I used to know how to cook.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Forget what?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Now you are being rude.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
What?
What do you mean?
Huh?
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
You're parents at that party?
Mikey was looking for you.
I don't know. How do I know?
Didn't want to miss anything.
Good.
So far.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
What about your shoulder?
No.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Forget your pager?
Randy Stetz?
Eight years.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
One of your cases?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Oh?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
I told you that was an accident!
Don't you pull that shit with me.
I have not spoken to him...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
I want some more.
But you're the fairest by far.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You both did it?
What was that?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
You've just done it -
You're sure?
Dear God, what have I done?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
As did the one who made me.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Why do you do this Lestat?
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
And they frighten you?
You followed me here, didn't you?
It's just a room...
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You loved Yvette...
But why did you tell her?
You're in 201 and 202.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Stupid. Stupid.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
I'm the King of the World.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Julie...
What do you mean?
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
I love it here.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Don't kill me --
You sure?
The shower again?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
What do you mean, Julie?
There was a body! I swear it!
...Why?
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
To a great weekend --
Well, I'm in school and --
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
You stumbled into my hiding place.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
Where's Thea?
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
I felt he did not like me.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
What would I be thinking?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
Woman, what are you doing here?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
You what? To save me?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
She's . . .
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
Hey, Ernie!
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Goodbye, everybody!
Uh-huh.
Well then, how do you know?
Well, no younger than I was.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
George, can I see you for a second?
No, George, don't . . .
Some other time, George.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Yes, sir.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
With coconuts?
Do I look as funny as you do?
If I told you it might not come true.
About what?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Oh, Mary . . .
Hi.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
George Bailey lassos stork.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Yeah, it's her job.
Shut up.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
I don't know.
Coming up!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Tina!
We got a helluva tide this month.
I know just where to go.
Mike's out there.
You're too close.  Back off.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Sean's awake.
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sean's asleep.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Did he raise the Kids?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go swimming?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
What's wrong?
No class.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Come on back up here!
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Mmmmmm.
Anything.  Anything.
Right after, the Kids went out?
Be careful....
About damn time.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
What about me?
Heading back?
Who wouldn't.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
He's going with you, Doctor.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Thank you.
Pre-opening jitters.
Where's the rubber band?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Where are you going?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
You're going down there again?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Change your mind?
Recovering nicely.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
So?
Come on!
That's right.
Go where?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
You can get killed!
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
You look like an orange worm.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Philip.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
'Course they're also so rich.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
How come?
Herpes?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
No...  It can't be.
I don't talk that way.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Make sure you put this back.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
She still talking to you?
Sure.
Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
Like mother, like son....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Sweetheart....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
That....
The fish.  Check it....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
All you all right?
Nothing out of the ordinary....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
Can you just go off...?
How can you just take the plane like this?
What are you doing?
I'm fine.
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I have two right feet.
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
I hope she's a good sailor....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
I stuck them on, man....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half don't...Bring her about....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
You getting a reading on them?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
I'll take care of it.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
How about any guys on your staff?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Why's she blind, Bro?
She wasn't lying about the van.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Ease off, John ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
Can I see your hands?
Me?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Did Amber have a dog?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Are you wearing a uniform?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
You know? How do you know?
Why?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
What was she like?
You think he still loves her?
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Now.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Maybe you should call her.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Oh God.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I heard.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
I'm sorry, I --
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
At last I find you.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Rod --
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
No, I air-dry.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Not everyone has what you have.
Jerry!  You made it --
Oh, tell the story.
How can I make your life better?
I'll go back to them.
Pardon me?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
Jerry --
You said "fuck".
I won't tell.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Udesky.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
It looks intact.
We could co-write a paper.
Anything good?
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Eric, your parents are both here.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Do you have any kids?
We're safe!
That's hard to believe.
Amanda!
How did you know?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
But he's the head of InGen!
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Well, is he?
I could come with you.
How could you possibly?
What?
What is that?
She's gutty.
Come on!
Head for the roof!
Something's wrong.
Can you set up?
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Ask her.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
There you are.  Out you come.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Alan, listen to this.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Straight-A brainiac!
I can't!  I'm scared!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
Yeah, they hate me.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
It's safe.
They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Well?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Hello?
I don't know...
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
You saw him?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
We're down to seven minutes.
What happened? Where's Jason?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Fine -- terrible.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
You work in the cemetery.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
I usually take lunch by the River.
-- Eduard --
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
They're not obliged to tell.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Where you've been employed for seven years.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
I'll bear that in mind.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
... Why take me into your confidence?
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
All these in the last year?
I could always apply there.
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
He's grubbing for money, father.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Jack!
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
What's that?
Why? She's a junkie.
Guess!
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think --
Who?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
You remind me of my uncle.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Is that all you have to say?
You and I -- a relationship.
Oh look what he did in them.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
You wanted to, or you are?
Then, close the case.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
We grew up together. Kids.
Think this is our guy?
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Where is the child?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You're late.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Sleep tight.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Objection.
Are you going to get remarried?
Was there Burger King?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
I've seen him.
Only can I still see him?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Yes.
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
John?
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
California?
She ever ask about me?
Thelma, if I die--
Ted.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
All quiet?
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Dalai Lama.
Did you receive the letter?
Me. First break of day.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
How big is Tibet's army?
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
America, we shall see.
Did you ever doubt it?
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
What does the butter spot feel like?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
We have enemies.
Am I running away?
You, kill me?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I do.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
It seems like we're getting lower.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Around here.  Yeah.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
What's that?
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
No way.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
I got something on the screen.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
Excuse me?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
In Maine?
That was an awful thing to say to me.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Well.  Goodnight.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Watch out!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
He just came up screaming.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Hey!!
Hank!
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
<u>You</u>?
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
No.
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Okay, Miss Starling?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Miggs has been murdered.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
A moth... How did you predict that?
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
On what basis would they reject him?
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Are you alright?
Why didn't you bury those people?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Where will we go?
You do not know what you are saying!
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
What?!
Fort Edward, then?
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
What is enough?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
The honors of war?
Le mot d'ordre?
What's wrong?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
And?
They found this?
Be careful with it.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
What can we do?
Shut up, all of you.
I'm going inside.
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Personal effects...
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Like what?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
I don't know what you mean.
I hate these Southern shites.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
What are you doing?
What can I do for you?
We gotta get those guns.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Dog, I have found the cash!
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
And look what happened to that.
I hope this is the right move.
Who's this fat man, then?
Tom?
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
How many wings have they got between them?
I don't know what the big deal is.
That makes it okay?
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
So you knew this young man before?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
And you and Private Graves--
Skinny?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
You still going to all the home games?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You look good--
Yeah, well--
Same as they done in Mexico.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Something like that.
This place is a gold mine.
Seriously.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Eladio Cruz.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Senora Cruz?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Tell that one, Hollis--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Historic occasion, isn't it?
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
No.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
You thought any more about our murder?
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
No. Is he sick?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What's she singing about?
You got in late last night.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Got him here?
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I should get back.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
How 'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
Mister D'Amour?
Nix.
You ever been married?
Anything?
Will you come to him on your knees?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
How did it go today?
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
What then?
Harry?
Oh God!
...yes?
Don't look.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
What makes you so sure?
They weren't worth a damn.
Then what do you want?
I saw him in Vegas once.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Are you sure?
Why'd you come here?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I like to know why things happen.
I want to see Swann face to face.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For an introduction.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Oh yeah?
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
Call me tomorrow.
Nix! Nix!
Swann?  What are you doing?
Ok.
What are you doing here?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Where's your husband?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Hello?
What?
Hello?
Ok.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
No, what are you talking about.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You killed my parents.
Why are you doing this to me?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Get up!!
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You don't want to face it.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's the matter with you?
What's up?
Ah, Mom.
So what do I do?
Whatever.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I'm an English major.  You like English?
My mouth is kinda dry.
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
Mom's going to hate it.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
I told him you looked like me.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
I know.  But chances are...
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's up with that?
What's up?
Thanks.
One, up.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So how come you could play basketball?
I don't know.  A lot.
I think we gotta kiss now.
So?
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
You don't look half-bad.
Why?
Then prove her wrong.
Yo, where's the "D"?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Never had to.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Actually, I don't...
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
From basketball.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
You're out of your mind.
What?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
From your mouth.
Good.
Your teeth are straight.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Yeah, hey. Chad.
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
Yeah.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
Say what you want and you'll see --
-- you the resident here?
-- can I get you?
Not enough, what do you want?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
How much you pay me for my help?
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
I have love.
What?  What does that mean?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You don't need braces.
I've been a good worker --
I don't know.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
Yeah.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
...ah...
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
...Lily...?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
Are you asking me that?
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She lived in Tarzana.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Where are you from originally?
Why does that sound silly?
I wouldn'tve asked --
Kind of.
How long have you taken care of him?
He's in here --?
You're here.
No I Said.
Marcie.
I didn't do anything.
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
--- What was that?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
You're my handsome man.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I don't.
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
...Jimmy...
But you can't say....
She's asleep.
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
What does that mean?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Bottled Water?
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
The fuck is wrong with you?
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
M'lady...?
God smiled upon us.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Louis, please -- !
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Wh-- Wha--
Hang himself?!
We must stop him!
Where are you going?!
What you're asking is impossible!
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
Athos, please...!
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
Recent hours have been a shock.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
Your Majesty...
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Betrothed?  I think not.
Silence!  I order you!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Where is Michelle?
... The ball... Continue.
You dead yet?
What number did you tear out?
Did they kill him?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
... Nothing.
What can I do for you?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Holy shit -
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
Where are you going?
What?
It was you who did the asking.
I wouldn't presume to try.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
In thirty-five minutes.
Where?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Get him to Atlanta.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Run it.
When are you coming back?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
When do you need it?
I'll take you.
How did you come to Gateway?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
I don't understand.
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
No.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
What the hell can I do?
Hello, hotshot!
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Mama was probably asleep.
Come home with me.
Lt. Fisk said...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
And Hobbs died?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Pictures?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Do you dream much, Will?
May I keep the file?
Kevlar Second Chance.
Sitcom...?
You have to do it.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
We were just trying to push the envelope --
You must take a little pleasure in it.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Tony Clifton.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Five.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
It's so dirty.
Excuse me, Andy...
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
Sure...
A -- a tourist.
He'll be contacting us again.
We'll need a search running.
What?!
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
What the fuck do they want with me?!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
I know what you're trying to do --
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Set down in there.
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
Yeah.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Hello, Neo.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Did you go to her?
Is Morpheus alive?
What happened?
What are you doing?
No, you're not.
You don't have...
It's a city?
Where is it?
Operator.
Operator.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
No.
Get out of here before this really goes up.
So?
Nervous?
Next time, bet with your own kind.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
What do you mean?
Let's get out of here.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't you move!!!
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
"Francis Macomber."
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Yeah.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Daddy!
-- Black.
I don't like cake.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Yeah, but --
...This shit's not bad.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
-- Did I hear 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.
I didn't say.
It doesn't matter.
Who are we talking about?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
I'm all excited --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Have we met?
No --
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Whose?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
Can't, sistah.
She knows how she feel.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
What are you doing here?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Yes --?
Oh goodness, no.
And I'll be a visitor.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
'To bed'?
-- Could you?
For how long?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
That's it?
Joe, that's the kitchen.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
What a good idea.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
Joe --?
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Dinner?  Absolutely.
What's okay?
I'll be the judge of that.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Which is what?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Are you threatening me?
Joe, don't do this --
Please.  Talk to me --
What do you mean?!
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
'Take me'...?  Where?
Get what?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Good morning, Dad.
Drew's aboard?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
Are you okay?
You know each other?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I've got patients coming in --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
39.
Slam it?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
No, let's go.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Where'd you get it?
You don't remember me.
You know him?
It's isolated.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Yeah, I hated it.
Did you?
What?
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
On the house.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Things change.
You really want to find this guy?
Why are you here?
You don't know him?
Who the fuck are you?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
How'd you know I was in here?
You probably.							 *
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
Where's the new drop point...?
We're not certain...
Sure.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
What do you like to drink?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I forgot the napkins.
Where would I go?
Is this the protective male talk?
No part of it wasn't real.
What...?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah?
Where the hell are you, man?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
So what do you want?
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
How'd they get onto you?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Who are you talking to?
Okay...see you soon.
You mean with the flowers...?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Why?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Must be some mess back there.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
Okay. Never argue with a man.
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
Oh hell, forget it.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
They wrong?
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
These guys're good drivers.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
Listen, I gotta have money.
You got it.
You really want to do business?
Sold. Let's go.
Looks like a cheap hotel.
'Figgers.
Anybody bitten?
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
Where you staying, Dad?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
You know where they are?
Just what?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Just Erich.
It's already been cut.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Know what?
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
Jeremy...
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
We'll be back at the platform in...
The kid...
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Thought it was my week for that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
You want to read it?
What's your new book called?
The profanity bothers you?
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Thank you so much.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Don't talk to me like that.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Yes, Paul.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Could be the weight of the snow.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
They're hauling Misery into court.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Your room.
To win?
You picked another winner!
Feel like pleading for your life?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Fight a bit of a cold..
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Uh-huh.
I wouldn't do that.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Hola..
So where did I got right?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Just like old times?
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I managed.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Very.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Something else?
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
It's the transponder.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
So what did he say?
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
You knew about Jim?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
What happened?
Whos dead?
Yes.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
What kind?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
Very good.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
The package is in the open.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Tell you what?
I guess.
Why not?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
That's what we do isn't it?
Whats the problem.
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Its working.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I'm getting married.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
You haven't once said you like my dress.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Why didn't he call himself?
Have you come from my brother?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
Fast.
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What are you doing!
Stop it!
Son of a bitch!
What did I do?
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
Who painted that?
So. Where are we sitting?
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
Ronny!
He's coming.
Loretta?
You don't want the fish.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
What's the matter?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
And we'll sell the house.
Your hair's different.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
Don't fight.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
My mother's recovered.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Yes.
Then why are you eating alone?
Nerves.
He's a plumber.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
None shall pass.
Look!
Are you sure he's got one?
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Yes, Lord.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Bring out your dead!
Don't be such a baby.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Who are you?
If we ... er ... 
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
The Castle Anthrax?
Well ...
Camelot ...
I done it again.
Bravely ran away, away.
What?
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll get over it.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Be careful who sees it.
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Mother....
By whose authority?
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
Nobody has any rights over me.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
Do you hunt?
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
You're injured.
Oh.
Surely --
Too busy looking after themselves.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
We took a nip of whiskey.
I was told you were in a fight.
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Should we take it seriously?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
I have a letter, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
What do you mean?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
So where is he?
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
I have to talk to you.
It is.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Then leave her.
Where do we go?
You mean we learn the rules...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.
What the fuck is that?!
Go for it.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
What did he do to you?
But I don't understand...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
So how do I start?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
Wow!
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Hi.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Was anyone hurt?
Number 17.
No.... I don't...
Okay.
"Really?"
"Before I kill you."
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
So, you came to see if he's out there?
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
And you believe that ?
Where are we going ?
What are you DOING here ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I thought you made this place ?
Is it over ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Zachary.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
What was that ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
Really ? On a date ?
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
People said she looked like me.
This is California, anything is possible.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Yeah.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
And she saved it.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
That's okay.
What's the matter?
Then what did she do?
But we made a business deal.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Get married?
You ratted on my mother??
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Boyfriend?
My mother stood on this very spot.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
Maybe.
A secret, I like that.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
He was caressing.
Hi!
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
It would be fantastic.
Did it hurt a lot?
He's a great poet.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
It's still available I hope?
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Hi.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I had a good time tonight.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Rock?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
She likes to play bingo.
Why not?
In the garage.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Hi.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Cause she's dying.
No.
Is that your camper?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Hi.
Big Ringo fan.
Are you married?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I think it should be outlawed.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Oh great!
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
You have no personality.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
You better not either.
For what?
Stay, huh?
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
I was devastated.
Ben Gay.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!

Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Well.  How come she didn't...
I asked you...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Winifred.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Barnett?
You bet.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
What?
How is she?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
How much?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Hey!
He's my father.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Well, Mr. Green.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
He is just wonderful.
What's this?
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
You got a place to stay?
The car broke down.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Do you ever do any writing?
Oh.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Stay.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
You know who that is?
What National TV...?
You don't know how pleased he'll be.
You know Bill is really mad at you.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
I'm Opal.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Why?
Oh --
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
You want a ride into town?
Got me an audition tonight.
You think it will?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Oh, why thank you.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Naw, she don't mind.
Mickey!
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Yeah.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Yes.
Yours.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
Yeah baby.
Yes.
Only on a much grander scale.
Take a wild stab!
How immediate is immediately?
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Who?
How's it working, Scotty?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
But how can you say that?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
I see.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I said: Cut it out!
Yeah.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
And his age?
That's two bucks, Joe.
You working?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
How d'you mean?
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
What d'you mean?
No, on the porch.
Ain't your fault.
Surprised?
What d'you mean?
Don't push me, Duff.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What about him?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Where're you going to go?
Okay.
We was just leavin', fellows.
Good-bye, Frankie.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
Wouldn't have known you.
Take it easy, Pop.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
How often is that?
Well, what're you going to do?
Hello.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
So I been told.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
He's your son.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
What's this?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Yeah, well it's working.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
What about the route to the core?
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Hello, Case.
What is it?
What about before that?
How soon is soon enough?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
My God... these people are insane.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
What is with this school and prom?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
YOU DID.
No Roger from op/ed?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
You're Pam?
Anita!
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You having fun?
Better person than I.
Wow. This must be big.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
So what are you thinking for college?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Why not?
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
You're fucked in the head.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
You mean a shithead.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
What is this place?
Here.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
What is it - What's wrong?
What is it?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
Who, Jesse?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
Hi.
What's so funny?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
We're going up to bed now.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Freddy?
Nancy!
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
It's over.  It's over.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
This is nice.
I'm serious.
Just until we get things under control.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
To who?
I've heard crazier things this week.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Hi.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
Why?
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You've got big feet.
Wow.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
That's not true.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
I thought I'd give it to you.
You were saying...
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Can I have your autograph?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
No!
Bella -- this is Anna.
That's nice.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Yes.  What do you think?
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
I did.
That's right -- Topol.
Buggered?
Hello.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
How was she?
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Get up, Billy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Whatcha boys playin'?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
A bus?
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
In ya go...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
They must be up there!
Ya know what, Fred?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Giving up?
It doesn't help him.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I said out!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Gimme the ball!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
You bet, Doc!
Time out!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Yeah!
Ten bucks.
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Hey, how ya doin'?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
How 'bout twenty?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
Whew! Hiya, boys!
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Excuse me?
Were they pen pals?
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
So?
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Hey--
Hi.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Is something the matter?
Very funny.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
I'll look forward to it.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
So, what are we waiting for?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
What's he do?
You don't have any idea?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Is that bad?...
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
A phone message.  Only--
I'm hungry.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Hi-iii...
How old are you?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Yeah--
And you didn't tell her?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Father Barry.
What makes him so special?
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
I want to be a teacher.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
What's that?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Thanks anyway.
What for?
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Listen, you like beer?
Now what are you doing?
You're not sore at me?
It's true.
Pigeons... .
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Charley.
But you've got to listen to me.
About Edie?
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
I want to see you, Terry.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
You got some nerve.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
The ropes are coming loose.
I am--It's our only chance.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
What kind of symbol?
Well?
Oh, if there is only time!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
I could make her another Cleopatra...
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Did you know that when you married him?
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Ask him his name.
You're good.
I'm not dressed.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Nice disguise.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Leave it where it is.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Hello?
Karen, I told you not to--
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
We still talk, though.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
Oh, God...
What were you gonna do with me?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Take your sunglasses off.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
Meaning?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
The <u>ninth</u>?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
You don't remember me, do you?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
You're a fighter?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
What's wrong with you?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
You gonna go get him?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
Thank you...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Foley's got it.
I found a rubber.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
Nervous?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
It's Germans!
What's there?
Land of the free.
Fun today.  Like old times.
Danny...
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Hello, Lilla!
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
They're waiting. Come on.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
All right. What's the scoop?
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
We're here on the sofa bed...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
You got a Tab?
You drive like a maniac!
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
I love you.
I thought you were...for a while.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Yes, sir.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
I beg your pardon?
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Don't get your hopes up.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
All right. But this better be good.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
He'll win.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
I have a note.
Would you get that, dear?
What happened to you?
Maddy's party.
Where have you been?
Isn't that awfully forward?
What are you doing?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Like what?
What will they be made of?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
What?
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Mom...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
What's wrong with your face?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Don't apologize for me.
Why are you getting dressed?
Drew!
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Fuck you.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Thanks for coming in.
I know that, Charles.
Take it easy, Walter.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
New baby?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Thanks for your time.
Find a lawyer?
How did they find out?
Get it?
What do you want?
Beckett?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
What do you love about it?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Rach.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Were you recently promoted?
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
A homosexual encounter.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Were you pleased with his work?
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
How many gays do you know?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Right.
You taught him a lesson.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Don't wanna miss this.
What? What is it?
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Tell me that was you.
You did this? To yourself?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
You'd die for them?
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
What, switch what?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
He can pilot?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
We aren't completely stupid.
Just shut up, okay?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
I don't suppose....
Frightening thought.
And pointless.
She's the captain, we should listen to --
A toast to whatever he just said.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
As you wish.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Any particular reason?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Can we take a dip?
Who are you?
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Thats a lie!
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Of course.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
It's humiliating.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Feel good?
...beautiful night.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Whew! - where that come from?
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
You wanted to see me sir?
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
I think you're drunk.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
I didn't say anything.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
You tried to run away.
Bad?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Why?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
Cold?
If you're doing all this just for me.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Would I want to?
I'm sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I expected nothing else.
They call me Jeff.
Name it.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
In case you want to have us followed.
It could have been an accident.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
You asked me where it all came from.
Recently, then.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
Now, you're being beastly.
And if you didn't believe me?
He checks too.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
Be nasty.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
How's Mary?
It's terribly good.
Attributed?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Can I give you a lift?
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
I haven't seen much of you.
Now, top secret file.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
That's enough of that.
Okay, I will.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
What have you got there?
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
I gotta be fucking crazy.
One shot stopping.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
We're wasting time.
You never were...
Yeah?  What?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Surf conditions okay?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Sorry.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
... so I started tailing him.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Who's the girl?
Look at you.
I... I gotta go.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Well, I saw you and--
My name's Johnny Utah!
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
Thanks.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Any sign of the hostages?
You saw what?
You're looking well, Dutch.
What have you got in mind, General.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
It's... it's not like that.
Congratulations, sir.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Nice car.  Yours?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
For the whole night?
Three hundred.
And why do you say that?
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
All right.  How much for the week?
But you want days too.
Three.
Did you buy some clothes?
What about dinner?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
What id we run into someone I know?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I know.  I'm glad.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
Business.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Love this car!  Is it new?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Want a pair of boots?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
I got a dress.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you would use your--
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
You're quick.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Hello.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Oh no. No, please.
Westley's only faking, right?
What? What?
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Where's Fezzik?
No --
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
We're really in a terrible rush.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Go in, get after her!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Let me explain-
Then make your choice.
You guessed wrong.
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
But that's cheating!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Assume away!
What do you mean?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Where would you like to eat?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
What is she gonna do here?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Not.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
You, Blum go Motel.
Finder's keepers.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
I solemnly swear...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
No.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What?
Cash.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Please!
Yes?
Where?
What thing could we be in together?
Is Mary... in trouble?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Probably on his way back right now.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Our Deputy sleeps.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Huh?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
We could laze around here a while longer.
For what?
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
You eat like a bird.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Only my share.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Phoenix?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
May I see your license?
Oh?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
My mother is not dead!
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
How do you do.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Take me down there.
What are you going to do?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What were you dreaming about?
There's no child here.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
You lie!
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Call the Homicide Squad!
Do you know George Winton?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
I see. Was that all she said?
You weren't going with her?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
To lunch.
But I have some friends waiting.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Could you?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
'Course it does.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
The new girl is here.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
Yeah.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
She's putting the titty back.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Why is it taking so long?
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She hasn't actually done anything...
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
I got an awful bad cold.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Galley what?
Um-m, well...
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Sons of bitches!
We should slow down.
No offices are gonna be open today.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
The booze.
What about him?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Hey...
Smooth move, hot-shot.
No, we're stealing.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
Maybe.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
Can't be worse than you.
Come again... ?
Get his attention.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
This shit was Ming.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
You got her warmed?
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Good shot, Red Two.
I'm going in.
There it is!
Then you know why I have to face him.
Yoda, I must know.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Well, I'm sorry.
Yes or no will do.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
I was telling the truth.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh Janet
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
What was that bang?
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Maybe we could try it this way.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
What guy
Was all I had to say
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Who's Eddie?
Creature of the night.
Some people are very shy by nature.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
Why?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
What did you say about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
No... I can't!
I can't go out.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Damn.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Did ya get the license number?
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Nine minutes!
Here -- Three minutes.
That's ten bucks.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
That's it? -- Completely?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
...What?
How old?
...Did ya fight last night?
Did ya win?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Here's the card?
'Bout an hour ago.
Really think so?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Please, kid.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
How am I doin'?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Hey --
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Help what?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
He's a riot.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
So altruistic.
So where is it?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
When will I hear from you?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Every man betake him to his legs.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Nurse.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
From Interpol?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Hazard pay...
Now, what did we steal?
Where's the case?
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Is it done?
What are you doing?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
So what is it you want to know?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Long enough to shoot back.
Cigarette?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
The Irish representative?
Give me a cigarette.
No you don't, and you know it.
And now...
I told you, I quit.
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
Can you get it?
Damn.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
And how do you figure we do that?
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
Maybe we should say somethin'.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
What are you talking about?
And you're solid on that?
Well, I don't know...
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
You're worth every last penny.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Why does that bother you?
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Yeah.
Just goes to show you.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Jesse?
Why?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
It was going to be a surprise!
We're out of here.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Yeah.
Winner six!
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
So tell me what you know.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Yeah, that's right.
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
How do you know he's our man?
You sound like that all the time.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
She's getting undressed.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
I wouldn't do that!!!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Well we're not friends.
See you in the next world.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
What is Mac out?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
That your gate down there?
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Is this a payoff?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
You speak English!
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
The license!  You get it?!
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Now, that's American music.
I'm sorry, Lee.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
I could get promoted right out of here.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How about a lift home?
How much they want?
What kind of assignment is that?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Hello.
Yes.
I would like one of my people to help.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
Yes.
Really?
I'll get the dress.
"Nothing but net."
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Maggie!
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Thanks.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
That's fair.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
I think so.
I'm a work in progress.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
I don't know.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
It's fun!  It's high.
Yes, you!
Lighten up, wahine.
He's going to be the pastor?
Let's go.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
I'm really rooting for this one.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
But it's on the water.
Am I what they had in mind?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
It's not true, but it feels true.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
Men never get this movie.
This is a photo of hair.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
It's probably just the flowers --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
You know.
Magic.  It was magic.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hi.
Which means --
Hello.
It's been about a year and a half.
What was it that made you know?
And you're worried about him.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
You'll like it.
It's Y. O. H.
Eighty dollars.
Dad?  About last night?
What?!
No, I'm not, but --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Sure.  Looking good.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Somewhere in the middle.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
God, she's beautiful.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
It's a little derivative.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I read an article about this ...
You're welcome to one.
Take a drink. Calm down!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Who? A scab?
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
Where you going?
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
A fighter, huh?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Tell me.
Where are you going?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I can't.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Is that how you play?
It gets me through the day.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
What are you hiding, Danny?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
I need my paycheck.
He knows where I work.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Really, I don't want to.
How you holding up?
Who is it?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Finland is a country.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Danny?
Why?
What the hell is that?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Jimmy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You're lucky, Flynne.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
You mean like the Donner Party?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Where's Bubba?
Resistance?
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Good luck, John.
Yep.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Where?
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
I've been humming it.
That only leaves three.
What about our grenades?
Caen?
You?  Leading a squad?
What about the company?
You get a translator, Captain?
Uh, Captain...
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Oh, yeah?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Huh?
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
What deal?
Goddamn it!
Thank you, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
I usually like surprises.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
Pardon me?
No, no he's not.
This evening is over.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Alright.
No, you're not a guy.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Visit her at the home.
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So it's an honor?
He does this every year?
Have a good sleep.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Oh.
After work?
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
It's okay, everybody does that.
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
It did?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Yeah you do.
What do you want?
Okay.
It's your castle, man.
The truck?
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I know
Just her name.
Lloyd.
I love you man
We're full on bonded.
Now you're back.
You know what, you'd like her.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
When?
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
What's that?
You asked for shoe polish.
This is not my problem.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
God bless you, sir.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Good.  How's it going?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Cotton.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It helped me realize one thing.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
No way.
Lemme take you home.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
And now, drum roll please...
Hello, Dwight.
Not good. How you doin?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
They're roomates.
What do you want from me?
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
What?
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Knock yourself out.
Time to change numbers again?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
The young girl is slashed again.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Do you want to die?
Take it off.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Jesus.  Hello?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
Excuse me?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
They found another note?
Why would the police come to you?
What about me?
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
You used to say that was our strength.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Basements creep me out.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
It's Sarah.
It is in my script.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
I didn't kill anybody.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
It's on the table.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Why did you kill my mother?
I think you have the wrong number.
No.
How do you know his name?
...please...
I don't know...
What door am I at?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
What brings you out to these parts?
I'll call for backup.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Have they found my father?
I was first to respond.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
You're evil.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Or a man's mentality.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Who?
I thought you dumped her for me.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
What do you think?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
It's none of my business anymore.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
How you feeling?
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Just keep leading the way.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I... I don't follow.
Who said this was murder?
It's a bucket of vomit.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You go to movies at least?
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
There must be something.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
How do you know all about this?
Are you alright?
Wait... just wait.
What is it?
Put your gun down!!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Are you absolutely certain?
It smells good.
But Mose Harper said...
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Let's get along...
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
You got any more orders, Captain?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Ay-eh...They was here...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
That's what I said.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Futterman?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
You ask her!
She's not a little girl any more.
Don't go takin' that stuff...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Where?
Stop that!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
I miss Tommi so much.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Maybe an animal.
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Ellen Straub.
You didn't tell her!
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Ah
You are a gentleman.
Follow that boat!
Thank you, my lady!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
A woman of property?
So now you are free to love
It's a comedy.
This time we take your boots off!
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
So what do we do?
How?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
What happened to Sam?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
I feel a scene coming on.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Cut round him for now.
We are lost.
The show must  you know
"Good morrow, cousin."
Be good to her, my lord!
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
There is time. It is still dark.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Will you read it for me?
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
But what of Lord Wessex?
Here we come at last, my lord!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
You're a bad loser.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
What do you think?
I'm only asking what you think.
You think so?
No, not that.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
What is this?
Doesn't it worry you?
Nothing.
They know.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Are you recording it?
Well, is it?
Parked outside?
Sorry to waste your time.
Who was it?
So we'll meet him, then?
-- instead of what he is --
Know and love?
Alex.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
No.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
You know we're right.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Expecting anyone?
What?
Are you all right?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It's about me and David.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Is this what they always look like?
Are you all right?
Do you know many of these people?
Yes.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
You get the job done.
What guy that died?
Do you think you could answer that?
It was some guy called Brian.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Your watch.
I thought you were in a good mood.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
What're you looking for?
Why not?
I don't know.
Wow.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I'll be back in a while.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
George --
Comb my hair out later, honey.
You know what I'm talking about.
I asked you first.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
You do know what money's like these days.
What!
I don't know. Probably not.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
No! Don't! Please!
That sounds like me.
Where do you want to go?
What are you looking at?
-- what?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
Yeah!
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- yes, George.
Call me!
There were some shots.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
Will we live together?
George.
Yeah.
I already said hello.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I've got to get her out of here.
Yes, yes, I did.
You need a cut.
Sorry, honey, I...
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
You live like a pig.
All night.
Godammit, George...
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
She's nothing but a whore.
You really think so?
Awww --
I'm coming over.
No you won't.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Who are they?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
We don't think marriage is important.
Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
I would say so, yes.
What?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
C'mon.
-- uhh-huhh...
Egypt?
Oh. thank you.
Why don't you ask for another one?
George? Was he alone?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
Thank you.
No!
I'm hungry.
How's it going, Doc?
Yes.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Yeah.
I won't make any noise.
Red Rum.
Mommy... Mommy...!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Shall we go into the living room?
Sure.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Delbert Grady.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
It's good to see you.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
What do you want me to do about it?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Somebody did that to him.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Stay away from me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me.
Very nice to meet you.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
You all right, Marty?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Your mom's not around, is she?
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
But how?
He's... dreamy.  He's...
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
It'll be hell.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Goddamn it!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Miss Van Cartier.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
A vote?
You sent for me?
What?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
He's a businessman.
No nothing.
Like what?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I have?
I've got to go.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
What're you doing?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
We're looking for Mike.
A nun?
There she is!
She's gettin' away!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Peace on Earth.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
An... entertainer?
It's so beautiful...
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
We both missed.
Where?
We must be a curious sight to him.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Damn... damn... damn...
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Where are we going?
It's spectacular.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
What is it?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
These scars.  How did you get them?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
Quickly, close it.
Where?
There was not much blood, was there?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Thank ye.
I don't reckon.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Stop it, Doyle!
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
What's in your bag?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Why'd you live there?
How come?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
It was alive?
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
What you readin'?
Yeah.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yeah.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Yes sir.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Not an easy book.
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Hey, man, how's it going?
She probably died.
What do you mean?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Like what?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Seventeen.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
It'll never be finished.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I just want to know where he is.
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
Yeah? Who is it?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Here and there. Around.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Eight-thirty.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Hey, it's you.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
And started to run.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
No wonder he was angry.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Hi, kid.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
How do you want that cooked?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
How long you have this detail?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Well, why does it?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Cigarette?
White or black?
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
You're welcome.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
You're right, Joe.
We're not?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
Done what?
You'd better go fix it.
Men?
Blow where?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
What message?  What motorboat?
And where's he going to be?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
We'll take a rain check.
And that's one of them.
Anything wrong?
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
Who needs vermouth?
I'll carry the instruments.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
Brand new.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
You're leading again.
Why not?
I don't care.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
And you'll be in all evening?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Really?
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Happy days.
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Why not?
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I wish you'd make sure.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Why?
Shell Oil?
Harmless - how?
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you do me a favor?
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Really?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
And who runs it?
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
If Ed ever found out....
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Whats his problem?
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
What color are my shoes?
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
No, count it, anyway.
That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Yes.
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
You didnt have to do that.
Whats he do anyway?
Hey, Sal.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
I always wondered what happened with us.
What is it you do again?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
It's cold, Daddy!
David Lee...
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Where's everybody?
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
From Miss Johnson --
You know somethin', Daddy?
Miss Boatwright --
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
'Bye, Mama...
Can I go day after tomorrow?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
What's wrong, Nathan?
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
What did he want?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
What?
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
To free Terrance and Phillip.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Cartman?!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Mom...
What?
Ber dada!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
What's that?
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Stan!
WHAT?
Oh dear God...
And Bill?
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
What's going on Terrance?
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
NAZIS!!
Excuse me?
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
So, are you on for the next one?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
What are we going to do?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
Yeah.  We did it.
Explosive?
Oh my God.  What happened?
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
So what's going to happen to you?
Will you marry me?
In that case, I accept.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
I'm looking for a man.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Three whips. To go.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Buzz Fazeli.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
What the fuck is this?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Don't tell me, John.
Uh...over easy.
It depends.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
132, 154.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Yeah.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Can I ask you something personal?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
How do you get this thing down?
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
You're really pissing me off.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Who identified the body?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Thirty yards.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
You don't think weapons are important?
What for?
Going active.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Can you open that panel?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
They switched us over.
From the sphere?
We have a library?
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Wait a minute.
What?  Why...
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Norman.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You fixed my suit?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
Three to six hours.
You're lying --
Stop it!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Top shelf, is it?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
What are you looking for?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
You sound defensive.
This answers one of our questions.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I don't follow you.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Norman, where are you?
Wisconsin's your answer.
I can't reach her.
Gimme a second --
There is one possibility.
She told me what you said, Norman.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Do you?
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
What'd you say?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
What report?
He wasn't feeling well.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What do I do?
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
I found it... It's just not there.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Get to the ship!
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
See Threepio... do you copy?
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
So what are you doing later ?
Profile's wrong... there.
Well, whad'ya know...
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Johnny, wait...
So ?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
You can't walk me home.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
I'm gonna miss you.
What's wrong with you ?
...I'm sorry.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.
Which way ?
Uh, look, Diz...
Cover me.
What's that, Diz ?
C'mon...
What frequency ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Oh, my, what's that ?
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, yeah, sure...
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
All dead except one, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Hit your jets, sir !
Who is...'V'ger'...?
They have repressed the Creator.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I still contain fragments of my human half.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
The people in New Hampshire.
But, but but but...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
Hi.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What happened?
Uh huh.
Fix my glasses.
Hi.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
But it's absurd.
How's your star?
Pelting down out there.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
We on for tomorrow night?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
I've been thinking.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I will.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Are you all right...?
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Are you Okay?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Get him on the phone.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Look.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Wally...
I know...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
What?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Who's White...?
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Not now.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
We're out of money.
I know the feeling.
I want to make a good film.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Why?
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I don't getcha.
Hi!
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
What did you say to them...?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
<u>Stop</u>...
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Do something.
...we don't have thirteen at table...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Mass hysteria.
It just slipped out.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Scream.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Look she's upset --
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
What's Thursd...
And what do you do wh...
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
This is my house too!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
That doesn't bother me.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
In high school.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
No.
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
I'm fine, ba...
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Planning on getting --
Napalm.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Me too.
Our children.
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
Still, please.
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Yet another spaghetti night.
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Machines do not EAT message.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Jackie?
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
Look, you've never liked me...
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Small world.
She hasn't mentioned this.
She's devastated.
I really look like shit.
It's the same choice you made.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Why was he on Death Row?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Twinkeys!
Mom?
Sure!...
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
But what kind of pull did you have?
So? How was school today?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Hey, Mikey!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
You're not.
You have beautiful skin.
It's over there.
Nigger.
Fuck me hard!
No, not really.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
So what's going on?
Oh, that's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
Huh. Kids?
Scooby?
Whoopee.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
--be prepared.
Forget about it.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
That's it!  Up ahead!
I insist...
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
What about Cooper--where is he?
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
So, what are we looking at White?
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
How goes the roll call?
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Thank you, Admiral.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
What about the President?
Yes!
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
You aren't sure!
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I don't think so, sir.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Go on, Major.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
What else could it be?
A through H is correct.
Check.
Just the missiles.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
They must have made a visual contact.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
No kidding.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Primary circuit is live.
Primary bomb is live.
No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
Then that settles it, doesn't it?
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Hey!
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Stuck with what guy?
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
Don't let 'em fight.
Fuck it!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Sure.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
What?
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Ah, you know people there?
He paid you man.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
It's safe, come on.
No, but I heard it was great.
You okay, man? You okay?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Mm.
I'd love to read that.
Um, mother-daughter.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Tim, what are you talking about?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
What'd you do?
They let you out?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Yes.
No.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Jeff! Come up here!
What?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk?
What?
Of course.
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
To his hotel?
Hey, Pony.
No, it's not...
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah, I crash there.
Now?
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Get off my roof!
Is that your driver?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah?
You do not want me to do your cover.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah, come on, play it.
No, I'm going.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
You know, my mom has this saying.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
So where are you?
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
I sure do.
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Oh... What are you working on?
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Don't use big bills!
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Good party.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I had a teacher like that once.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Hello, Betty.
Hers.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
Yes, I did.
I wouldn't know.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
I will not have it butchered.
I want you to do this work.
There sure is.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
What's that?
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
What are the notes?
What's the matter with you?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
When did he say it, Norma?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Whose room was this?
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
What's the matter, Max?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
And she's turned you into a servant.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Don't leave me.
This is my favourite place in the city.
Like it?
We're from different worlds.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Hi.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
I know it.
Why the empty cage?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I can't help it if men notice me.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
She did that deliberately.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That was meant for me!
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
There is a way.
Then teach me how.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You're going to take me back?
What are you talkin' about?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You...um...you never got married?
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Do you really know Superman?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
What?
Now...when do I get a taste?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Everything.
Yeah? How's it look?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Thanks.  Let's go
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
I don't know you, lady.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
Oh, Superman!
53.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Anybody been hurt?
I do?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Oh Clark, no!
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I'll try to remember that . . .
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
Why?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
He has powers as we do . . .
So --  I hope you like it.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
General --- ?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Impossible? Why?
Awesome!
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
I'd like to.
Not...gray.
Hey!
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
What'd you call him?
So I've noticed.
Nuts. He made it.
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
No news is not good news. Y'know
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
You got wax in your ears?
You've been doing some research in the archives.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, the kickback story...
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh.
How much do you weigh?
I...uh...
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why did you do that, Billy?
About the Ottos?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Excuse me?
Anything you didn't understand?
That's what he said, is it?
It's for the school bazaar.
Away from your crazy Mom.
And winter?
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
From you?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Yes.
Dolores.
I have no questions.
What do you mean?
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Crafts.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
DADDY!!!
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Yes.
Are you expensive?
How does the family survive?
Yes.
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
What do you remember about the accident?
Of course.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Are you sleeping?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Will you mind your own business!
Did she accept?
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Hello, Harry.
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
And who's feet is she on now?
Are you listening?
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Avidly.  He was staring.
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
You ought to be used to me by now.
If that's for me, tear it up!
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Torque wrench please.
Alriight!!  My man!
We don't have much time.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
John, get out of the way!!
I know!
Kyle, don't go!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You broke my arm!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
I must be destroyed.
Where do you stand on all this?
On Furtwngler.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I'm very sorry.
So, what does the Russki want?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
You bet.
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
Did you call someone you knew?
What did Goering say?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Von der Null?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Show me.
What?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Reese...you got a first name?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
You'll learn.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Not possible.
Sarah.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Here's her driver's license.
What?
I could fight you on this.
Are you finished?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Clean out your locker.
What's with him?
Alright... okay...
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
See you around.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
There goes a thousand dollars.
Nice.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
What is it?
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Want anything to drink?
What is this!?
What are you doing... ?
Who are "they?"
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
I don't know.  A lot.
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Originally, Connecticut.
Julliard, yeah.
Never better.
Really?
What?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
How long will these take?
Physical?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
What?
Hey... !
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
It's not going to hold your weight.
Yeah.
It's still an electric shock!
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
All the carvings.
Are you coming to confess?
I don't know.
No.
You know what he's really upset about?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
What happened?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
What did it cost?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Jeez.
Theo... Did you?
That's so sad.
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Not for you, clearly.
It's not a compliment.
Italian.
You should have let me do the talking.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Man knows what he likes.
Who done it, then?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
What's so fucking funny?
What are we standing on?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
I've been wondering something.
Same.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Sort a few things out.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
I bet.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
So what's your beef, pal?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Makin' trouble for someone?
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
How'd you get in here.
He's expecting you?
Is Valentine here?
I miss my kids.
You've made it ... brighter.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Thanks.  You, too.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
...Mm.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...You bring a check?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
How ya doin', Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Uh-huh.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Not guilty, your honor...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
...Probity.
...Huh?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
...How you today, Ed?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
Second chair.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Lieutenant --
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
This place is a maze.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
What happened?!
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Like the claw.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
What's that?
What do you do?
I don't want to go this way.
They've got something.
What?
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
They're all heavily armed.
Genetic damage?
You're not.  Where is it?
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
We're not going to make the storage room!
I don't believe it.
Why is he in the basement?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Cue music...
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
How can they have a child?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Stay where you are!
It'd be an adventure.
Arrah!
What do I do?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
--Darling--
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Well, we're FBI agents.
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
I need your clothes, Byers.
You've been back to Dallas?
This man's still alive.
I'm looking for him.
He just let it explode.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You know my work?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
How can I reach you?
You found something?
-- You saw this experiment?
You told me you had answers.
Jesus, Mulder...
Had you.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Why are you whispering?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
What did you find?
You think they went left?
On whose orders?
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
Where's Scully?
What is it?
You're lying.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
My god...
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Sing a song of sixpence.
Is it cold in here?
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
With Stargher I saw things...
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
COME ON!
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Thank you.
Already there.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
What about the legalities of this...?
Any psychiatric medication?
So?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Here he is.
We proceed assuming she is.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
No.
What's she talking about?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Tell me about him.
Holly.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Wer ist da?
...again.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
He works in a military hospital.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Next, Paine.
So would I.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
It wouldn't work.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
...excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Did the police believe you?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Could he have been at all conscious?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Harry...
Something wrong.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
I'm Daffy.
I'll share something with you.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
What about Moliere?
One kilometer
So from there to there?
Have you told someone?
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly.
No one follows that midrash.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
How come you know all this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Is he a Nazi?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Where'd you get this?
Fuck that.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
You wouldn't announce it?
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Explain it so I can.
I thought you hated Torah.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Hello...?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Shut up. Fuck you....
That's all we've got left.
Didn't you get anything?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
Who'd you kill?
Who's this?
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What's happened??
It can't be true!
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
You know each other?
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
Is it a poem?
Ten thousand.
Yes?
What about the shoes?
Where did you get that?
What's with the voice?
Why?
Well, what are they?
Enzo?
Your mother?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Why?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
... Push me back in the water...
A drink to warm up?
Tea... or whiskey?
But what brought you to Sicily?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
How can you tell it's a female?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
And you?
What?
What's wrong?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
We do!
Esther!
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Mom! We're eating!
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
Hammer, you alright?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
Is he in love with you?
This is for "mama and the kids."
What's left of him.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
What, senorita?
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
It could be a man.
Some crazy guy.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
To the eye? Like other men.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Wait 
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Get it out of here!
You look swell in that threealarm number --
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
That might depend on where youre going.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I found this at your brothers.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You lost my money?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Black suits you.
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
I dont.
Is there anything to understand?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Something like that?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Crow what?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Weve still got the Italian...
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
Who are you?
Where?
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Oh... We split up.
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Maybe I dont.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
What are you talking about?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Who else knows about the boy?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?
Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
So why didnt he?
I think youd rather not know what I think.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Try again, and this time be polite.
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
They lost their son. Why?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I thought you were an archer?
Good.
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Go onto the next question.
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Really?
Quick -- hide in here...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Please... may I have it back...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
... as always, majesty...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
What's going on?
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
This is no good!
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
How many did he give you?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
My... visions...
What signs?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
But you already confessed this morning...
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Who is this "he"?
I don't want to wait for his call.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
I'm going to get a doctor.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
For what? For my tie?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Calm down, what, what is it?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
You sell anything?
I know.
It's not funny.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Very appropriate.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Pig!
Dirty pig!
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Where are you hiding?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Watch your feet!
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Everyone has to practice.
Which way are the rooms?
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
How much did ya lose?
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Then why ain't he dead?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Mottola.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Lonnegan after you, too?
I'll take him anyway.
No signs of trouble?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Henry.
She coulda killed me last night.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
I don't even know you.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What is this?  I got work to do.
What about this Rosebreen?
What's your next step, Nick?
Yes.  He admitted it.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Any luck?
I can't.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Oh!
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
She... she fell over backwards.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
How's your brother?
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
What about this Nunheim?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Trail him!  Trail who?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
What're you doing here?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
You did!
But he's interested!
I think we may as well sit down.
Have a shot?
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
That's my business.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
I'm not telling anyone.
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
It might.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You got types?
Who's that?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Sit down!
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
He's just been for a walk.
What are you going to do?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
What do you mean?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Where are you going?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
What?
What are we going to do!?
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
What kind of mine?
We've got rope?
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Epps!
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You're out of your mind.
Then step aside.
Wes--
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They're not going to--
Steady it out!
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
You're not losing trust, are you?
They're doing more than slapping.
A whole lot of nothing.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
Wait.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Sorry.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Just let me rest for a second.
What did you say?
What do we do?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Australia.
Woods.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Some good ones.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What is this?
You get it yet?
You really think there's a treasure inside?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
You down?
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Hurry up.
Control ON.
What did you get?
I have to... he's a G-34
Then why did you bring it up?
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
There goes another of your disciples.
What are you doing here?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Treat. We treat devices.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Why do you do it?
Ex-girlfriend?
You got it.
Bev, you're the greatest...
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Lane oil...
Alright!
Why are we stopping here?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
P.E.T.N ...
Device.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
I'll do it.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Well, have you found it?
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
But--
Good morning, Major.
Yes, Baron.
I want to see-- 
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
The pepper, too?
I like you, Baron.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
By the way, how is your German?
But, Lily--
And you--
Naturally I did.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Beautiful.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Precisely.
Then why do you want to go?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Right!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Yes, I saw it--but--
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
How you two doin'?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
Hello again.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Fabrizio said you might be up --
What is it? A sapphire?
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
It's getting quiet.
Never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Don't come any closer.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Feeling a little better, I see.
Good afternoon--
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
You'll excuse me. 
There's soft music--
Married?
Don't be a c-a-t.
How well do you know her?
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
A dollar forty.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Care to join us?
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Here's your fifty.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I didn't--
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
With your dry wit and humor--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
--And he has sex appeal.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
How much did you lose?
I went for four.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I was in his cabin--
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Listen, I want to talk to you.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Forget it.
How you feeling, Doc?
Very instructive
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
He's drunk.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
So what does he want?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
What is it?
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
That was lovely!
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Florentino!  He's getting away!
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Virgil?
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Do you feel better now?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
... Shoelaces?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Natalya?
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
No.
This has got to be a mistake.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
What do you make of all this?
You won't get away with this!
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Is the helicopter ready?
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Oh, no.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Your feet are cold.
I'm worn out.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is the garden doing?
What, are you having another party?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
What's the problem here?
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
When did you talk to Harry?
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
To infinity and beyond!
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Right here in the van.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Woody!  Buzz!
Here!  In the car!
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
You are a liar!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Woody?!
I want to go home.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Oh, it is?
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
My Leica's gone.
How's David?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
What do you think she wants?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
You may speak.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
You first.
That's good coke.
What's he doing up here?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I want your money, I'll take your money.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
What?
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
Well, it isn't.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
Now remember --
Exactly.
Running time?
Who wrote it?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Why?
That's hardly a substitute.
It's the great outdoors.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
What do you see as your main strengths?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
The ship....
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Admit it. We're lost.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Can we have it quiet?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Captain?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Spock.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
Spock... the booster rockets.
What is this?
No special conditions?
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Each man's pain is unique.
I know you better than that.
Are you embezzling?
I don't get it.
Did you say Group 7 access?
What for?
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
Yeah...?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
Flynn?
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
User requests are what computers are for.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Did we make it?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
What's goin' on?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Hey... !
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Yes, MCP.
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
You seem fine now.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Harry?  HARRY?!
Fourteen, Harry.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Copy that.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Hello, Harry.
What did you tell him?
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Why did you continue to see him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
I'm sorry, honey.
I don't take those assignments.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Like one?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What is it you want me to do?
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Gotten your mail yet?
The forager's back.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Thanks a lot.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Ask me them again. One by one.
I don't remember.
Like it?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
How long have you worked here?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I do.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Is this a joke?
What?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Clarence sent a letter?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
In case of what?
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Elliot.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Wanna count your money?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I've seen him.
You and Robin moved?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
He knows.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Him?  You saw that man?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
We need gas.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You want me to rob him?
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Uh, that message...me?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
You have him in restraints.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Oh, Jesus.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
It's a Movado.
Nope.  Darrell.
But he's dead.
Accident.
Nothing.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
No charge.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
No!
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Taking a little trip?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Least you can leave.
You've been around.
Nice place you got here.
What do you do anyway?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
How far is it to California?
John?  John where are you going?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
John!
The trunk.  It's locked.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
Shut up.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
I asked you a question.
What happened to your hand?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You're fucked.
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
The old lady?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Soda.  You got any soda?
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hey!  You there!
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
I wasn't doing anything.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Hey!
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Talk?  About what?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I'm not rambling.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
What happened to your hand?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Accident.
Hey.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Look, Harlin.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
What you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Soda.  You got any soda?
That's right on my way.
I got it.
No, I've got it.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Is that why you're with him?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You mean the Shaman?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Grace ... Grace?
I don't know about that?
Why?
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Why's that?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
The old lady?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Genuine Draft?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Help me, Grace, help...
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Yes?
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I have to go now.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
When?
No.
How much did you take off?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
He tell you where them others is?
I thought... you was an angel.
Scouting?
Are you really going to kill them?
Free ones?
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah. See?
Yeah, I guess.
Books. He's my biographer.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
They really got all that money, them whores?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
He said that, huh?
She's passed on, Kid.
You're goin' back with him?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Did... you... get... him?
First one I ever killed.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
Wha... what f-for?
You... gonna take... the money?
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
He musta been movin' right along.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Yeah?
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
Easy, Bill.
Who's he?
All that money... I mean... did you...?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
That ain't what I mean.
I don't get it.
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
Come home, Dean.
I know who he is.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
This is not right.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
Why don't you just calm down'
Me too.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
What is it Keaton?
What-are they speaking?
How are you, Keaton?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
The answer is no.
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
This is all bullshit.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
You're joking.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
He was accused of jury tampering.
We thought it was just.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
How is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
She getting good care over there?
I didn't do too well for you.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The most respected ...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I can't guarantee that...
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Do you think it's my fault?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
Hi, Mickey ...
I have to talk to you.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Who told you that?
Well, well, well.  Huh?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Would you like a drink now?
No.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Come here.
Why?
I made it.
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
Good-bye.
How can you be sure?
Do you hear anything?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where are you now?
No!... No!
No, I can't tell you!
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
What else?
There's a name on the gravestone.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Yes.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Let me go! Let me go!!
You believe that I love you?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
From that music.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Well?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
I think I can lick it.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Here you are.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Is she pretty?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
She'll be out in a moment.
Jesus.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Don't point at me.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
She's got no fucking pulse.
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Sun rises at 5:52.
What is your problem?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
My god.
What is it?
That's right.
You said that Boyd.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
We need padded chairs.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Boyd...What have we done?
Just do it.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
The hell I did!
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
There's my point exactly.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Stop.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Are we supposed to?
What do you mean, you think so?
Photographer?
Florist?
Why did you forget the tent check?
Are we going to do this again?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
You expect more what?
Time out.
That's absurd.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
I need your help.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
I know.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
No...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I don't care for him.
I'll take a ride.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Where did you get that?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
Pup corn?
There.
Stop this, stop this.
Where's the camera?
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Let me pass!
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
That's fifteen by seven?
Me?
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
What are you doing here? Get out.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
Don't say that.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
In English, please.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
What happens if I can't catch him?
Enough to level an entire city block.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
It was you, wasn't it?
My God...
SID  NO!!!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You ready for this?
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
What happened when he was 17?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
That's why I'm asking.
My guess is dead.
How's your pulse?
Where's John?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
There you go  best seat in the house.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
It's the White House.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
No, this is great.
What can it hurt.
Izzat the thing...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Who we got here...?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
It won't hold.
What do you know about them?

Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...

Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.

That's not bad at all.

The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
We're locked into Albania.
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
Why do people go to war?
...why?
Trade Re1ations.
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building.

How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?

Yes, but there wasn't a War.

Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Grand Marnier.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Hey the door was open.
The stock's going to Pluto!
Sell?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
That's great Dad.
Don't start, alright.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...thanks Natalie.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
What if they call him?
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Yeah, right...
So what's the problem?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
How do you know?
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about hard work?
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Hello Bud.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
Do you think you're ready?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
He did?
Businessman?
Yeah 
What's that?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Your books Master Loftmore
Hello?
No Jonathan.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
No thank you sir we're fine.
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
I know that.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
No.
What?
That can't feel good.
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Yes?
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
You must think I'm pathetic.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
I didn't sleep with him.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Telling you...
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Okay.  Okay.
I guess not.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Wanna fool around?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Claire...
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Yep.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
Oh.
You're not at the center.
I'm sorry...
Do I have everything?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
I may have seen her on campus.
I don't like this, this...
Claire...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
She did it.
What?
The leaves...
I'm cooking you dinner.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
A what...?
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I beg your par---
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
A girl...?
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
HARDER!
you're very --- different.
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Do you love me, Michael...?
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Wow...
Rowan Mayfair.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Which do you think is her best shot...
I thought you were someone else
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I don't know
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me about your wife...
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I don't like sugar
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Is LESLIE here?
ANGEL...
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Hurry.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
You go first.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
My new bike.
If you could just sign right there.
That's a crappy thing to say.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
In what sense?
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I don't get the distinction.
Don't write that part.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
He's on the move?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Do you trust me, Julie?
I want you to trust me.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You promise you'll finish school?
But who would run the store?
I never figured you for a pimp.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
Yes?
Bad news.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Then what?
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
She bit you?
Thank you, Jimmy.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
A ride.  You want one?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Get off my property.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
So, where you off to now?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
How much?
We have to stick with the plan.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
I just want my life back...
Come on, let loose!
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
It doesn't look like it.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
What?
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Jim, are you all right?
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Can you fill me in here?
Willard...
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Anyone?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
Good work.  Really.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Who is that girl, anyway?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Hey!  Give me that baby!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I'm all finished.  Now what?
I just wanted to test it first.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Time is running out.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You have no right to keep us here.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
Oh? Anything else?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
But why?
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long have I been here?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Anybody know about this?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
From now on you'll be history
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
Ahh!  Ah!
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
...bed.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oh --
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh - I'll get it!
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Oh, my!
I'll be home in time for supper!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
...free!
Did I scare you?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
...along.
No -- No -- No -- No!
Yeah.
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
And you're going to lead us.
Dorothy!
Whozat?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Let's.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
What about us?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Stop that dog!
What happened to Len Tashka?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
The King pipeline.
Weve got to get out.
...yes?...
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.
He survived?
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
The name?
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
Oh my God...were buried alive...
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
What the hell are you doing here?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
So you killed your father.
Was this all about the oil?
Valentin Zukovsky.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Warm.
This is the end.
Why?  What's the problem?
What about our end?
Blake?  Dead?
I'm here, Laurie.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Its very strange.  Times flowing backwards . . .
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Dont be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We wont even be here, will we?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
What the hell -- ?
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
. . . That was quick.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
New information.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
What is this place?
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Like what?
I was invited. What's your story?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What are you doing?
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
This is your standard dart gun.
I think I'll hang on to these.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Help me with this guy.
That's the guy.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
What's going on, my friend?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
What does that mean?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
How long have you been in Alaska?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
You should always work with a spotter.
What do you say?
Let go.
I do love a good check mate.
Where am I?
What are you going to do?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Is that what you're looking for?
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Frederick Frankenstein?
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
What in God's name are you doing?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Surprised?
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
There seem to be quite a few books.
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Frederick Frankenstein?
The wockers with the knockers.
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Thanks...for all your help.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
Hello there.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Are you busy?
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
It wasn't me.
Oh, Doctor!
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Yes, I know.
I'm getting tired.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
Drink!
Foooooood!
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
