they do not ! 
they do to ! 
i hope so . 
she okay ? 
let &apos;s go . 
wow
okay  -  -  you &apos;re gonna need to learn how to lie . 
no
i &apos;m kidding .   you know how sometimes you just become this  &quot; persona &quot;  ?   and you don &apos;t know how to quit ? 
like my fear of wearing pastels ? 
the  &quot; real you &quot;  . 
what good stuff ? 
i figured you &apos;d get to the good stuff eventually . 
thank god !   if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure .  .  . 
me .   this endless  .  .  . blonde babble .  i &apos;m like ,  boring myself . 
what crap ? 
do you listen to this crap ? 
no .  .  . 
then guillermo says ,   &quot; if you go any lighter ,  you &apos;re gonna look like an extra on 90210 .  &quot; 
you always been this selfish ? 
but
then that &apos;s all you had to say . 
well ,  no .  .  . 
you never wanted to go out with  &apos;me ,  did you ? 
i was ? 
i looked for you back at the party ,  but you always seemed to be  &quot; occupied &quot;  . 
tons
have fun tonight ? 
i believe we share an art instructor
you know chastity ? 
looks like things worked out tonight ,  huh ? 
hi . 
who knows ?   all i &apos;ve ever heard her say is that she &apos;d dip before dating a guy that smokes . 
so that &apos;s the kind of guy she likes ?  pretty ones ? 
lesbian ?   no .  i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers ,  so i &apos;m pretty sure she &apos;s not harboring same - sex tendencies . 
she &apos;s not a .  .  . 
i &apos;m workin &apos; on it .  but she doesn &apos;t seem to be goin &apos; for him . 
i really ,  really ,  really wanna go ,  but i can &apos;t .   not unless my sister goes . 
sure have . 
eber &apos;s deep conditioner every two days .  and i never ,  ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment . 
how do you get your hair to look like that ? 
you &apos;re sweet . 
you have my word .   as a gentleman
i counted on you to help my cause .  you and that thug are obviously failing .  aren &apos;t we ever going on our date ? 
you got something on your mind ? 
where ? 
there . 
well ,  there &apos;s someone i think might be  -  - 
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing ? 
forget french . 
that &apos;s because it &apos;s such a nice one . 
i don &apos;t want to know how to say that though .   i want to know useful things .  like where the good stores are .   how much does champagne cost ?   stuff like chat .   i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone . 
right .   see ?   you &apos;re ready for the quiz . 
c &apos;esc ma tete .  this is my head
let me see what i can do . 
gosh ,  if only we could find kat a boyfriend .  .  . 
that &apos;s a shame . 
unsolved mystery .   she used to be really popular when she started high school ,  then it was just like she got sick of it or something . 
why ? 
seems like she could get a date easy enough .  .  . 
the thing is ,  cameron  -  -  i &apos;m at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser .   my sister .   i can &apos;t date until she does . 
cameron . 
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s my fault  -  -  we didn &apos;t have a proper introduction  -  -  - 
forget it . 
you &apos;re asking me out .   that &apos;s so cute .  what &apos;s your name again ? 
okay .  .  .  then how  &apos;bout we try out some french cuisine .   saturday ?   night ? 
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part .   please . 
well ,  i thought we &apos;d start with pronunciation ,  if that &apos;s okay with you . 
can we make this quick ?   roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break -  up on the quad .   again . 
i did . 
you think you  &apos; re the only sophomore at the prom ? 
i don &apos;t have to be home  &apos;til two . 
i have to be home in twenty minutes . 
all i know is  -  -  i &apos;d give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey . 
sometimes i wonder if the guys we &apos;re supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with ,  you know ? 
bianca ,  i don &apos;t think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door - opening and coat - holding . 
combination .   i don &apos;t know  -  -  i thought he &apos;d be different .   more of a gentleman .  .  . 
is he oily or dry ? 
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist .  i mean .  dr .  bonchowski is great an all ,  but he &apos;s not exactly relevant party conversation . 
would you mind getting me a drink ,  cameron ? 
great
joey . 
who ? 
where did he go ?   he was just here . 
you might wanna think about it
no . 
did you change your hair ? 
you know the deal .   i can  &apos; t go if kat doesn &apos;t go  -  - 
listen ,  i want to talk to you about the prom . 
you &apos;re concentrating awfully hard considering it &apos;s gym class . 
hi ,  joey . 
hey ,  sweet cheeks . 
my agent says i &apos;ve got a good shot at being the prada guy next year . 
neat .  .  . 
it &apos;s a gay cruise line ,  but i &apos;ll be ,  like ,  wearing a uniform and stuff . 
queen harry ? 
so yeah ,  i &apos;ve got the sears catalog thing going  -  -  and the tube sock gig  &quot;  that &apos;s gonna be huge .   and then i &apos;m up for an ad for queen harry next week . 
hopefully . 
exactly  so ,  you going to bogey lowenbrau &apos;s thing on saturday ? 
expensive ? 
it &apos;s more
perm ? 
patrick  -  -  is that -  a . 
it &apos;s just you . 
is that woman a complete fruit - loop or is it just me ? 
no !  i just wanted
what ?  to completely damage me ?   to send me to therapy forever ?  what ? 
i just wanted  -  - 
you set me up . 
let go ! 
so did you
you looked beautiful last night ,  you know . 
i guess i &apos;ll never know ,  will i ? 
not all experiences are good ,  bianca .  you can &apos;t always trust the people you want to . 
god ,  you &apos;re just like him !  just keep me locked away in the dark ,  so i can &apos;t experience anything for myself
i guess i thought i was protecting you . 
i &apos;m not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes . 
that &apos;s not
no .  you didn &apos;t !   if you really thought i could make my own decisions ,  you would &apos;ve let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage . 
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him . 
why didn &apos;t you tell me ? 
after that ,  i swore i &apos;d never do anything just because  &quot; everyone else &quot;  was doing it .   and i haven &apos;t since .  except for bogey &apos;s party ,  and my stunning gastro - intestinal display  -  - 
but
just once .   afterwards ,  i told him i didn &apos;t want to anymore .   i wasn &apos;t ready .  he got pissed .   then he broke up with me . 
you did what ? 
he said everyone was doing it .   so i did it . 
as in .  .  . 
now i do .   back then ,  was a different story . 
but you hate joey
he was ,  like ,  a total babe
why ? 
in 9th .   for a month
what ? 
joey never told you we went out ,  did he ? 
i wish i had that luxury .  i &apos;m the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can &apos;t go ,  because you won  &apos; t . 
i do care .  but i &apos;m a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons ,  not someone else  &apos; s  . 
like you care . 
listen ,  i know you hate having to sit home because i &apos;m not susie high school . 
you &apos;re welcome . 
i don &apos;t get you .   you act like you &apos;re too good for any of this ,  and then you go totally apeshit when you get here . 
i really don &apos;t think i need any social advice from you right now . 
bianca ,  i need to talk to you  -  -  i need to tell you  -  - 
can we go now ? 
you are so completely unbalanced . 
yeah ,  he &apos;s your freak friend mandella &apos;s boyfriend .   i guess since i &apos;m not allowed to go out ,  i should obsess over a dead guy ,  too . 
it &apos;s shakespeare .   maybe you &apos;ve heard of him ? 
like i &apos;m supposed to know what that even means . 
at least i &apos;m not a clouted fen -  sucked hedge - pig . 
can &apos;t you forget for just one night that you &apos;re completely wretched ? 
bogey lowenstein &apos;s party is normal ,  but you &apos;re too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that . 
what &apos;s normal ? 
you &apos;re ruining my life &apos;  because you won &apos;t be normal ,  i can &apos;t be normal . 
i think you &apos;re a freak .   i think you do this to torture me .   and i think you suck . 
what do you think ? 
oh ,  i thought you might have a date  i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m bothering to ask ,  but are you going to bogey lowenstein &apos;s party saturday night ? 
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we &apos;re going . 
oh my god ,  does this mean you &apos;re becoming normal ? 
can you at least start wearing a bra ? 
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don &apos;t get out of my way . 
nowhere .  .  .  hi ,  daddy . 
where &apos;ve you been ? 
i have a date ,  daddy .   and he  &apos; s not a captain of oppression like some men we know . 
i &apos;m missing something . 
fine .   i see that i &apos;m a prisoner in my own house .   i &apos;m not a daughter .  i &apos;m a possession ! 
you &apos;re not going unless your sister goes .   end of story . 
he &apos;s not a  &quot; hot rod &quot;  .   whatever that is . 
it &apos;s that hot rod joey ,  right ?  that  &apos; s who you want me to bend my rules for ? 
no ,  but
the prom ?   kat has a date ? 
daddy ,  i want to discuss the prom with you .  it &apos;s tomorrow night  -  - 
because she &apos;ll scare them away . 
why ? 
promise me you won &apos;t talk to any boys unless your sister is present . 
just for a minute
daddy ,  no ! 
wear the belly before you go . 
it &apos;s just a party .  daddy . 
oh ,  god .   it &apos;s starting . 
if kat &apos;s not going ,  you &apos;re not going . 
daddy ,  people expect me to be there ! 
it &apos;s just a party .  daddy ,  but i knew you &apos;d forbid me to go since  &quot; gloria steinem &quot;  over there isn &apos;t going  -  - 
otherwise known as an orgy ? 
if you must know ,  we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends . 
and where &apos;re you going ? 
daddy ,  i  -  - 
exactly my point
but she doesn &apos;t want to date . 
but it &apos;s not fair  -  -  she &apos;s a mutant ,  daddy ! 
then neither will you .   and i &apos;ll get to sleep at night . 
what if she never starts dating ? 
no !  you &apos;re not dating until your sister starts dating .   end of discussion . 
now don &apos;t get upset .  daddy ,  but there &apos;s this boy .  .  .  and i think he might ask .  .  . 
just sent  &apos;em through . 
padua girls .   one tall ,  decent body .  the other one kinda short and undersexed ? 
never
fan of a fan .   you see a couple of minors come in ? 
didn &apos;t have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan .   aren &apos;t they a little too pre - teen belly - button ring for you ? 
always a pleasure ,  brucie . 
best case scenario ,  you &apos;re back on the payroll for awhile . 
you humiliated the woman !  sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score . 
no ,  i  &apos; m not . 
buttholus extremus .   but hey ,  you &apos;re making progress . 
the hell is that ?   what kind of  &apos;guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you &apos;re talking to her ? 
extremely unfortunate maneuver . 
hell ,  i &apos;ve just been going over the whole thing in my head and  - 
you told me that part already . 
it &apos;s her favorite band . 
assail your ears for one night . 
okay !   i wasn &apos;t sure
he &apos;s pretty ! 
dead at forty - one . 
her favorite uncle
it &apos;s a lung cancer issue
number one .   she hates smokers
are you kidding ?   he &apos;ll piss himself with joy .   he &apos;s the ultimate kiss ass . 
will bogey get bent ? 
in that case ,  we &apos;ll need to make it a school - wide blow out . 
this is it .   a golden opportunity .  patrick can ask katarina to the party . 
like we had a choice ?   besides  -  -  when you let the enemy think he &apos;s orchestrating the battle ,  you &apos;re in a position of power .  we let him pretend he &apos;s calling the shots ,  and while he &apos;s busy setting up the plan ,  you have time to woo bianca . 
you got him involved ? 
hey  -  -  i &apos;ve gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street . 
i thought you hated those people . 
you know ,  if you do go out with bianca ,  you &apos;d be set .   you &apos;d outrank everyone .  strictly a - list .   with me by your side . 
that &apos;s what i just said
did she actually say she &apos;d go out with you ? 
forget his reputation .   do you think we &apos;ve got a plan or not ? 
i &apos;m serious ,  man ,  he &apos;s whacked .   he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers . 
they always let felons sit in on honors biology ? 
no kidding .   he &apos;s a criminal .   i heard he lit a state trooper on fire .   he just got out of alcatraz .  .  . 
he seems like he thrives on danger
what makes you think he &apos;ll do it ? 
you wanna go out with him ? 
what about him ? 
unlikely ,  but even so ,  she still can &apos;t go out with you .   so what &apos;s the point ? 
i teach her french ,  get to know her ,  dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me . 
the mewling ,  rampalian wretch herself . 
that &apos;s her ?   bianca &apos;s sister ? 
yeah ,  just a minor encounter with the shrew . 
you could consecrate with her ,  my friend . 
you mean i &apos;d get a chance to talk to her ? 
guess who just signed up for a tutor ? 
sure do  .  .  .  my mom &apos;s from canada
you know french ? 
joey dorsey ?   perma - shit - grin .   i wish i could say he &apos;s a moron ,  but he &apos;s number twelve in the class .   and a model .   mostly regional stuff ,  but he &apos;s rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out . 
he always have that shit - eating grin ? 
because they &apos;re bred to .   their mothers liked guys like that ,  and their grandmothers before them .  their gene pool is rarely diluted . 
why do girls like that always like guys like that ? 
i could start with your haircut ,  but it doesn &apos;t matter .   she &apos;s not allowed to date until her older sister does .   and that &apos;s an impossibility . 
why not ? 
bianca stratford .   sophomore .  don &apos;t even think about it
who is she ? 
you burn ,  you pine ,  you perish ? 
that girl  -  -  i  -  - 
yeah ,  but these guys have never seen a horse .   they just jack off to clint eastwood . 
that i &apos;m used to . 
couple thousand .  most of them evil
how many people go here ? 
get out ! 
thirty - two . 
how many people were in your old school ? 
yeah .   a couple .   we &apos;re outnumbered by the cows ,  though . 
i was kidding .  people actually live there ? 
north ,  actually .   how &apos;d you    ? 
so  -  -  which dakota you from ? 
c &apos;mon .   i &apos;m supposed to give you the tour . 
so they tell me .  .  . 
you the new guy ? 
you get the girl . 
what &apos;s the worst ? 
where ? 
she kissed me . 
you makin &apos; any headway ? 
she just needs time to cool off i &apos;ll give it a day . 
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns  .   that &apos;s a direct quote
i don  &apos; t know .   i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it . 
what &apos;d you do to her ? 
then ,  go get her
sure
cameron  -  -  do you like the girl ? 
she &apos;s partial to joey ,  not me
what  &apos;re you talking about ? 
it &apos;s off .  the whole thing . 
cameron ,  i &apos;m a little busy
don &apos;t make me do it ,  man
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night . 
so what does that give me ?   i &apos;m supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can &apos;t play their instruments ? 
okay  -  -  likes :   thai food ,  feminist prose ,  and  &quot; angry ,  stinky girl music of the indie - rock persuasion &quot;  . 
i &apos;ve retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you &apos;ll find helpful . 
what &apos;ve you got for me ? 
yeah  -  -  we &apos;ll see . 
and he means that strictly in a non -  prison - movie type of way . 
and why would i do that ? 
leave my sister alone . 
your sister here ? 
away . 
where ya goin ? 
not at all
hey  -  -  do you mind ? 
they &apos;re running the rest of me next month . 
yeah ,  and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow .   tough break . 
the vintage look is over ,  kat .  haven &apos;t you been reading your sassy ? 
enough with the barbie n &apos; ken shit .  i know . 
i don &apos;t know ,  dorsey .   .  . the limo .  - the flowers .   another hundred for the tux  -  - 
get her to act like a human
do what ? 
how &apos;d you do it ? 
a deal &apos;s a deal . 
it &apos;s about time . 
forget her sister ,  then . 
forget it . 
a hundred bucks a date . 
what ? 
i just upped my price
i got her under control .  she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image . 
watching the bitch trash my car doesn &apos;t count as a date . 
i &apos;m on it
when i shell out fifty ,  i expect results . 
fifty ,  and you &apos;ve got your man . 
take it or leave it .   this isn &apos;t a negotiation . 
fine ,  thirty . 
i can &apos;t take a girl like that out on twenty bucks . 
how much ? 
i can &apos;t date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend .   and that &apos;s the catch .  she doesn &apos;t want a boyfriend . 
you &apos;re gonna pay me to take out some girl ? 
you got it ,  verona .   i pick up the tab ,  you do the honors . 
but you &apos;d go out with her if you had the cake ? 
you need money to take a girl out
you just said
sure ,  sparky .   i &apos;ll get right on it . 
yeah ,  whatever .   i want you to go out with her . 
two legs ,  nice rack .  .  . 
what do you think ? 
yeah
hey  -  -  it &apos;s all for the higher good right ? 
you better not fuck this up .   i &apos;m heavily invested . 
what ?   we took bathes together when we were kids . 
you and verona ? 
uh ,   yeah .   we &apos;re old friend*
i hear you &apos;re helpin &apos; verona . 
so what you need to do is recruit a guy who &apos;ll go out with her .   someone who &apos;s up for the job . 
does this conversation have a purpose ? 
but she can &apos;t go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her .  right ? 
we &apos;re not . 
well ,  actually ,  i thought i &apos;d run an idea by you .   you know ,  just to see if you &apos;re interested . 
we don &apos;t chat . 
nope  -  just came by to chat
are you lost ? 
hey . 
oh ,  honey  -  -  tell me we haven &apos;t &apos; progressed to full - on hallucinations . 
william  -  he asked me to meet him here . 
who ? 
have you seen him ? 
oh ,  good .   something new and different for us . 
you  &apos; re looking at this from the wrong perspective .   we &apos;re making a statement . 
okay ,  okay ,  we won &apos;t go .   it &apos;s not like i have a dress anyway
listen to you !   you sound like betty ,  all pissed off because archie is taking veronica . 
well ,  i guess we &apos;re not ,  since we don &apos;t have dates  . 
can you even imagine ?   who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ? 
i got drunk .   i puked .   i got rejected .  it was big fun . 
you didn &apos;t
i did bianca a favor and it backfired . 
you didn &apos;t have a choice ?   where &apos;s kat and what have you done with her ? 
i didn &apos;t have a choice . 
you went to the party ?   i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity . 
who cares ? 
what &apos;d he say ? 
no fear . 
you think this &apos;ll work ? 
if i was bianca ,  it would be ,   &quot; any school you want ,  precious .   don &apos;t forget your tiara .  &quot; 
does it matter ? 
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death ,  but i &apos;m consuming .   do you mind ? 
neither has his heterosexuality . 
that &apos;s never been proven
william didn &apos;t even go to high school
william would never have gone to a state school . 
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male - dominated ,  puking frat boy ,  number one golf team school .  i have no say at all . 
you could always go with me .   i &apos;m sure william has some friends . 
the people at this school are so incredibly foul . 
but imagine the things he &apos;d say during sex . 
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking ,  but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions .   you &apos;re venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy . 
an attempted slit . 
what &apos;s this ? 
just a little . 
mandella ,  eat .   starving yourself is a very slow way to die . 
block e ? 
he always look so
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s completely incapable of doing anything that interesting . 
that &apos;s pat verona ?  the one who was gone for a year ?  i heard he was doing porn movies . 
patrick verona   random skid . 
who &apos;s that ? 
don  &apos; t you even dare .   .   . 
oh ,  bianca ?   can you get me my freshman yearbook ? 
because i like to torture you . 
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ? 
yeah ,  but then i fucked up .  i fell for her . 
is that right ? 
besides ,  i had some extra cash .  some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl . 
i thought you could use it .  when you start your band . 
a fender strat .  you bought this ? 
i didn &apos;t care about the money . 
really ?   what was it like ?   a down payment now ,  then a bonus for sleeping with me ? 
it wasn &apos;t like that . 
you were paid to take me out !   by  -  -  the one person i truly hate .   i knew it was a set - up ! 
wait i .  .  . 
it gets worse  -  -  you still have your freshman yearbook ? 
that  &apos; s completely adorable ! 
that &apos;s where i was last year .   she &apos;d never lived alone  -  -  my grandfather died  -  -  i stayed with her .   i wasn &apos;t in jail ,  i don &apos;t know marilyn manson ,  and i &apos;ve never slept with a spice girl .   i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune .   end of story . 
what ? 
my grandmother &apos;s  . 
look ,  i &apos;m   -  -  sorry  -  -  that i questioned your motives .   i was wrong . 
oh huh
it &apos;s just something i had .   you know
it &apos;s scurvy &apos;s .   his date got convicted .  where &apos;d you get the dress ? 
how &apos;d you get a tux at the last minute ? 
nothing !   there &apos;s nothing in it for me .  just the pleasure of your company . 
answer the question ,  patrick
you need therapy .   has anyone ever told you that ? 
you tell me . 
so i have to have a motive to be with you ? 
create a little drama ?   start a new rumor ?   what ? 
because i don &apos;t want to .  it &apos;s a stupid tradition . 
why not ? 
no ,  i won &apos;t go with you
no what ? 
no . 
you know what i mean
is that a request or a command ? 
go to the prom with me
you &apos;re amazingly self - assured .  has anyone ever told you that ? 
no one else knows
what ? 
you &apos;re sweet .   and sexy .   and completely hot for me . 
no  -  -  something real .   something no one else knows . 
i hate peas . 
tell me something true . 
i know the porn career &apos;s a lie . 
hearsay . 
the duck ? 
fallacy . 
state trooper ? 
for .   .   .   ? 
you up for it ? 
you never disappointed me . 
how ? 
then you screwed up
something like that
so if you disappoint them from the start ,  you &apos;re covered ? 
i don &apos;t like to do what people expect .  then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change . 
yes
acting the way we do . 
so what &apos;s your excuse ? 
yeah ,  well ,  don &apos;t let it get out
a soft side ?  who knew ? 
i dazzled him with my wit
so how &apos;d you get chapin to look the other way ? 
good call . 
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect .   and piss you off . 
the partridge family ? 
maybe . 
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ? 
forget it .   i &apos;m stayin &apos; . 
put your right foot there  -  - 
try lookin &apos; at it from this angle
c &apos;mon .   it &apos;s not that bad
i guess i never told you i &apos;m afraid of heights . 
look up ,  sunshine
he left !   i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me . 
other than my upchuck reflex ?  nothing . 
so what did i have an effect on  ? 
don &apos;t for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties . 
unwelcome ?   i guess someone still has her panties in a twist . 
unwelcome . 
wholesome . 
pleasant ? 
you  &apos;re so  -  - 
i heard there was a poetry reading . 
what are you doing here ? 
excuse me ,  have you seen the feminine mystique ?   i lost my copy . 
no offense ,  but you &apos;re sister is without .   i know everyone likes her and all ,  but  .  .  . 
bianca
who ? 
he just wants me to be someone i &apos;m not . 
so what  &apos; s up with your dad ?   he a pain in the ass ? 
i &apos;m gettin &apos; there
oh ,  so now you think you know me ? 
you don &apos;t strike me as the type that would ask permission . 
my father wouldn &apos;t approve of that that
start a band ? 
this . 
do what ? 
i should do this . 
why &apos;d you lie ? 
then why &apos;d you ask ? 
no ,  you weren &apos;t
maybe . 
were you in jail ? 
busy
when you were gone last year  -  -  where were you ? 
but it &apos;s gigglepuss  -  i know you like them .   i saw you there . 
and i &apos;m in control of it . 
what ? 
kat !  wake up ! 
you know what they say
i thought you were above all that
hey man .   .   .   you don  &apos; t think i can be  &quot; cool &quot;  ?   you don &apos;t think i can be  &quot; laid back &quot;  like everyone else ? 
i know .   it &apos;d have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila .  you don &apos;t seem like the type . 
i hate him . 
dorsey . 
who ? 
why &apos;d you let him get to you ? 
just let me sit down . 
see that ?   who needs affection when i &apos;ve got blind hatred ? 
like you could find one
because then i &apos;d have to start taking out girls who like me . 
why ? 
sure ,  i do
you don &apos;t care if i die
i told you
why  &apos;re you doing this ? 
leave it to you to use big words when you &apos;re shitfaced . 
this is so patronizing . 
what if you have a concussion ?  my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable .  not that i could tell the difference .  .  . 
i know ,  just let me sleep
uh ,  uh .  you lie down and you &apos;ll go to sleep
i just need to lie down for awhile
you &apos;re not okay . 
i &apos;m fine .  i &apos;m
okay ? 
funny ,  you &apos;re the only one
i say ,  do what you wanna do . 
 &quot; i &apos;m getting trashed ,  man .  &quot;  isn &apos;t that what you &apos;re supposed to do at a party ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
why ,  don &apos;t you ? 
you know who the raincoats are ? 
you know ,  these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats ,  but they &apos;re right up there . 
do you mind ?   you &apos;re sort of ruining it for me . 
that &apos;s what you want ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
excuse me ? 
hey .   great show ,  huh ? 
depends on the topic .  my fenders don &apos;t really whip me into a verbal frenzy . 
you &apos;re not a big talker ,  are you ? 
hi
i was in the laundromat .  i saw your car .  thought i &apos;d say hi . 
are you following me ? 
seven - thirty ? 
you  -  -  covered in my vomit . 
come on  -  -  the ponies ,  the flat beer ,  you with money in your eyes ,  me with my hand on your ass .  .  . 
and why would i do that ? 
then say you &apos;ll spend dollar night at the track with me . 
i don &apos;t really think you warrant that strong an emotion . 
you hate me don &apos;t you ? 
i know a lot more than that
like where ?   the 7 - eleven on burnside ?  do you even know my name ,  screwboy ? 
the night i take you to places you &apos;ve never been before .   and back . 
oh ,  right .   friday . 
pick you up friday ,  then
my mission in life . 
there &apos;s a way to get a guy &apos;s attention . 
sweating like a pig ,  actually .   and yourself ? 
i mean wo - man .   how ya doin &apos; ? 
oh ,  christ .   don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve changed your mind .   i already sent  &apos;em a check . 
when i go ? 
you know ,  fathers don &apos;t like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives .   it means we &apos;ve become spectators .   bianca still lets me play a few innings .   you &apos;ve had me on the bleachers for years .   when you go to sarah lawrence ,  i won &apos;t even be able to watch the game . 
no  -  -  impressed . 
what &apos;s the matter ?   upset that i rubbed off on her ? 
bianca did what ? 
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy . 
which parts ? 
parts of it . 
so tell me about this dance .  was it fun ? 
no ,  daddy . 
i don &apos;t understand the allure of dehydrated food .   is this something i should be hip to ? 
funny . 
yeah .   she left with some bikers big ones .   full of sperm . 
was that your sister ? 
i want to go to an east coast school !  i want you to trust me to make my own choices .   i want  -  - 
you &apos;re eighteen .   you don &apos;t know what you want .   you won &apos;t know until you &apos;re forty - five and you don &apos;t have it . 
so what i want doesn &apos;t matter ? 
as a parent ,  that &apos;s my right
because you &apos;re making decisions for me . 
why can &apos;t we agree on this ? 
i thought you were punishing me . 
is this about sarah lawrence ?  you punishing me ? 
then tell them i had a seizure . 
my insurance does not cover pms
enough ! 
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ? 
you decided . 
i thought we decided you were going to school here .   at u of 0 . 
i know . 
just smack her now . 
am i supposed to feel better ?  like ,  right now ?   or do i have some time to think about it ? 
no  .  .  .  i believe  &quot; heinous bitch &quot;  is the term used most often . 
tempestuous ? 
the point is kat  -  -  people perceive you as somewhat  .  .  . 
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls .   i was merely a spectator . 
well ,  yes ,  compared to your other choices of expression this year ,  today &apos;s events are quite mild .   by the way ,  bobby rictor &apos;s gonad retrieval operation went quite well ,  in case you &apos;re interested . 
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action . 
katarina stratford .   my ,  my .   you &apos;ve been terrorizing ms .  blaise again . 
yeah .  .  . 
kat a fan ,  too ? 
right . 
macbeth ,  right ? 
oh yeah . 
you think ? 
yeah .   i guess . 
cool pictures .   you a fan ? 
hi . 
hey there .   tired of breathing ? 
man  -  -  don &apos;t say shit like that to  me .  people can hear you . 
sweet love ,  renew thy force ! 
you were right .  she &apos;s still pissed . 
no  -  i &apos;ve got a sweet - payin &apos; job that i &apos;m about to lose . 
so you got cozy with she who stings ? 
i &apos;m likin &apos; you guys better
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows . 
yeah . 
ever been to club skunk ? 
just for now . 
are you telling me i &apos;m a  -    &quot; non - smoker &quot;  ? 
good enough . 
what ?  ! 
we &apos;re your guys . 
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast ? 
patrick ,  pat ,  you &apos;re not looking at the big picture .   joey &apos;s just a pawn .  we set this whole thing up so cameron can get the girl . 
so dorsey can get the girl ? 
that &apos;s where we can help you .   with kat . 
dorsey can plow whoever he wants .  i &apos;m just in this for the cash . 
i think i speak correctly when i say that cameron &apos;s love is pure .   purer than say  -  -  joey dorsey &apos;s . 
what is it with this chick ?   she have three tits ? 
the situation is ,  my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford . 
what plan ? 
whatever the hell it is you &apos;re standin &apos; there waitin &apos; to say . 
what ? 
say it
see you next week ! 
you &apos;re completely demented . 
well ,  you know  -  -  there &apos;s the prestige of the job title .  .  .  and the benefits package is pretty good .  .  . 
you weren &apos;t abused ,  you aren &apos;t stupid ,  and as far as i can tell ,  you &apos;re only slightly psychotic  -  -  so why is it that you &apos;re such a fuck - up ? 
what &apos;s to discuss ? 
why don &apos;t we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid ? 
i &apos;m at a loss ,  then .   what should we talk about ?  your year of absence ? 
touch of the flu . 
i don &apos;t understand ,  patrick .   you haven &apos;t done anything asinine this week .  are you not feeling well ? 
with the teeth of your zipper ? 
it was a bratwurst .   i was eating lunch . 
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls . 
i missed you . 
that  &apos; s what i thought
absolutely not . 
did i have anything to say about it ? 
your daughters went to the prom . 
what just happened ? 
but  -  -  who  -  -  what  -  -  ? 
have a great time ,  honey ! 
dr .  ruth ? 
what do you wanna watch ?   we &apos;ve got crap ,  crap ,  crap or crap
kissing ?   is that what you think happens ?   kissing isn &apos;t what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day . 
they &apos;ll dance ,  they &apos;ll kiss ,  they &apos;ll come home .   let her go . 
pirate  -  -  no question . 
would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral ? 
you &apos;re not helping . 
tumescent ! 
jesus !   can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating ? 
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country . 
what &apos;s a synonym for throbbing ? 
make anyone cry today ? 
in the microwave . 
can &apos;t be that far ,  i say .   also ,  i don &apos;t like the smell of the sea around here .   smells like a cunt .  bad sign .  .  . 
we left three weeks ago ,  alonso .  can &apos;t be that near . 
we should have seen land . 
we &apos;ll all go crazy .  .  . 
he &apos;s the devil &apos;s child .  .  . 
with a face like that ?   i don &apos;t want you looking at me .   you hear ? 
ah ,  leave him alone .   he &apos;s doing no harm . 
what are you listening to ,  chicken ass ? 
you &apos;ll be drinking your own piss .  .  .  for the glory of spain .  .  .  and admiral colon .  .  .  !   bastard ! 
the water &apos;s going putrid in the barrels . 
i never seen heat like this !   not even in las minas ! 
if - god - wills - it ! 
asia can be found to the west  -  -  and i will prove it . 
blind faith is what i consider heresy ! 
don &apos;t you realize your words could be considered heretical ? 
did he not choose a carpenter &apos;s son to reveal himself to the world ? 
if god intended our proximity to asia ,  do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ? 
no .   the portuguese have already discovered black - skinned people .   i ,  too ,  will find other populations  -  -  and bring them to the word of god . 
is that all that interests you ?  gold ? 
trade ,  your excellency .   according to marco polo ,  the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world .  even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold . 
if they agree to follow me ,  yes . 
your life ,  and that of others ! 
your eminence ,  there is only one way to settle the matter .   and that is to make the journey .   i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible . 
excellency ,  you are right . 
senor colon ,  an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew .   i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment . 
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations ,  the circumference of the earth is approximately .  .  .   22 , 000 leagues or more .   which makes the ocean .  .  .  uncrossable . 
i am ,  your eminence
unfortunately ,  don colon ,  that is precisely where our opinions differ .  .  .   are you familiar with the work of aristotle ?   erathostene ?   ptolemeus ? 
yes ,  your eminence .   the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks . 
you say asia can be found by sailing west ? 
a waste .  .  .  ?   let me tell you something ,  arojaz .   if your name ,  or mine ,  is ever remembered  -  -  it will only be because of his . 
what a tragedy .  .  .  what a waste of a life .  .  . 
you can see for yourself . 
on the contrary ,  your eminence .   it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross . 
it won &apos;t be easy to get rid of your prophet now ,  don sanchez . 
indeed .   the world is full of mercenaries  -  -  and states often make use of them ,  when it benefits them .   my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain . 
he is a mercenary !   did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions ? 
naturally .   but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a .  .  .  dispute over a point of geography . 
the judgment is ours ! 
the state has some reason to be interested in this man &apos;s proposition ,  your eminence .  .  . 
i can &apos;t keep my eyes off you .   i would like to catch up with all the moments i didn &apos;t spend with you . 
what is it ,  now ?   tell me .  .  . 
i am busy inside . 
can &apos;t you stay with us a little ? 
not everything .  .  .  do you think i care ?   i &apos;m a free man again .   riches don &apos;t make a man rich ,  they only make him busier .  .  . 
they took everything .  .  . 
they tried .  .  .  but i didn &apos;t let them . 
god .  .  .  you &apos;re so beautiful !   i can &apos;t believe no other man has ever taken you away from me .  .  . 
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service . 
you don &apos;t usually ask . 
beatrix ,  i want to ask you something . 
that &apos;s something you can &apos;t decide . 
i don &apos;t want you to wait for me . 
i &apos;m not asking you to swear to anything . 
thank god .  .  . 
she said yes . 
i find that hard to believe . 
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman .  .  . 
i &apos;d love to argue with you sometimes .   but you &apos;re never here ! 
are we going to argue ? 
well .  .  .  that &apos;s true .   i have a child by a man who won &apos;t marry me !   who &apos;s always leaving .  .  . 
i haven &apos;t given you much of a life . 
i know . 
i could be gone for years . 
i am afraid this is not the worst news . 
how could i be ?   the mainland has been found .   exactly as i said it would . 
i am not a seaman .   but i heard it is no more than a week at sea .   i hope you are not too disappointed . 
how far from here ? 
congratulations .   then i am free to search for the mainland . 
viceroy of the west indies . 
appointment to what ? 
my letters of appointment . 
yes .  .  .  i remember .  .  . 
don alonso de bobadilla . 
bartolome and giacomo colon . 
may i ask by whom ? 
forgive me ,  don bobadilla  -  -  those positions have already been taken . 
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands ?   is it not so ? 
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind . 
really ?   god .  .  .  i wouldn &apos;t know where to start .  .  .  and yet .  .  . 
i want you to tell me everything you remember ,  father .   from the beginning .   everything . 
he never had one .  .  .  except aboard my ships ! 
he asks when he can come to visit you .   he left his address . 
what does he say ? 
i am not listening ,  father .   but i can &apos;t help hearing . 
what are you listening to ? 
there must be a passage to that other ocean . 
father .  .  . 
not bad . 
how are you feeling ,  fernando ? 
this time with me ! 
i have to explore the mainland . 
yes .  .  .  yes ,  i do .  .  .  on all of them ! 
do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven ? 
you promise ?   do you swear on st .  christopher .  .  .  ? 
there &apos;ll be a time . 
i want to go with you ! 
all of them created by people like me . 
roofs .  .  .  towers ,  palaces .  .  .  spires .  .  . 
what do you see ? 
look out of that window . 
i am not afraid of you .   you are nothing but a dreamer . 
call them . 
all i have to do is call the guards . 
to rise so high ,  in so short a time ,  is a dangerous occupation .   a little hypocrisy goes a long way . 
what .  .  .  ?   do i have so many already ? 
you seem to have a special talent for making friends . 
good !   we are also in need of judges .   except there are no thieves ! 
don bobadilla is already a judge ,  my dear don cristobal . 
but we do have a lack of notaries .  you should contact my administration . 
 .  .  .  for a commoner ? 
you defend yourself admirably .  .  . 
forgive me ,  don colon .   but what about gold ? 
they don &apos;t see sin in their nakedness .   they live according to nature ,  in a never ending summer .  the islands are covered with trees ,  filled with blossoms and fruits .  and .  .  . 
if you won &apos;t accept our proposal ,  we &apos;ll simply find someone who will . 
and were you never ambitious ,  excellency ?   or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles ,  a fault for the rest of us ? 
then you are too ambitious . 
i &apos;m not bargaining ! 
i remind you ,  senor colon ,  that you are in no position to bargain with me . 
no .  .  .  !   i have waited too long ,  fought too hard .   now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit !   no .  .  .  i will not be your servant ! 
no ? 
no .  .  . 
you never learned how to speak my language . 
utapan ,  won &apos;t you speak to me ?   you used to know how to speak to me . 
you did the same to your god ! 
you have to find them ,  utapan .   look what they did ! 
ask him if he will help . 
he understands . 
we will work with his people .   we want peace .   ask the chief if he understands ? 
he has medicine .   tell him we admire his people . 
chief says .  .  . 
 .  .  .  and also to bring medicine . 
chief says  -  -  he has a god . 
to bring the word of god . 
why ? 
thousands . 
chief says  -  -  how many ? 
tell him his country is very beautiful .   tell him we are leaving men here  -  -  to build a fort . 
chief knows . 
tell the chief we thank him . 
you come !   you speak first ! 
island .   far . 
what is it ?   a tribe ?   an island ? 
say not here !   cuba ! 
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i have the impression that i didn &apos;t change that much .   i still can &apos;t accept the world as it is ! 
oh ?   so you are a new man ? 
new worlds create new people . 
i knew you would . 
i have to disagree . 
you &apos;ll always be older than me ,  father . 
i suppose we &apos;re both old men now . 
give me absolution . 
i believed in you .  .  . 
you are bound by an oath ,  father . 
my son ,  my son .  .  .   your certitudes are sometimes frightening .  .  .   christopher ,  you must speak to them .  and if you don &apos;t i will . 
if i tell them ,  they won &apos;t follow me .   you know that i am right ,  father .   you trust me .  .  . 
may god forgive you .  .  .  !   you must tell them !   you must tell your men ! 
i am not sure .  .  .  it could be twice the distance . 
how long ? 
i lied .   the journey will be longer than i said . 
what are you saying ? 
father ,  i have betrayed my family .  i betrayed my men .   and i betrayed you . 
i am listening ,  my son . 
forgive me ,  father .   for i have sinned . 
in nomine patris et filius ,  et spiritus sancti . 
colon !   don &apos;t ! 
all of them !   just lies ! 
damn all of you !   you all set up theories based on what ?   you never leave the safety of your studies !  go out !   find out what the world is about and then tell me something i can listen to ! 
colon ! 
damn god ! 
if god intends you to go ,  then you will go . 
wait !   i &apos;ve waited seven years already !   how much longer do you want me to wait ? 
you mustn &apos;t give way to despair .  you must wait . 
only god knows the meaning of such words ,  my son . 
i &apos;ve been contradicted all my life .  .  .  eternity ! 
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted ! 
passion is something one cannot control ! 
father marchena ! 
i &apos;ll try to remember that ,  marchena .  .  . 
two minutes .  .  .  and already you &apos;re a dead man .   don &apos;t let passion overwhelm you ,  colon . 
so was christ ! 
esdras is a jew . 
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr ,  esdras .  .  . 
how can you be so certain ? 
ignorance !   i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands . 
how can you be so certain ?   the ocean is said to be infinite . 
to open a new route to asia .   at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it .  .  . 
why do you wish to sail west ? 
with some difficulty .   i had to promise them you were not a total fool . 
how did you manage it ? 
that &apos;s what it says . 
god .  .  .  that &apos;s in a week ! 
father ,  i am doing what i think is the best for him .   and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself . 
diego is a bright boy  -  -  a pleasure to teach  -  -  but so serious .  .  .  brothers should be raised together ,  colon .   even brothers from different mothers .  .  . 
your majesty  -  -  some men are content to read about things .   i must see them with my own eyes .   i cannot be other than i am . 
there is one thing i &apos;d like to understand .  .  .  why do you want to go back ,  after all this ? 
thank you . 
but without your brothers .   nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies .   you may explore the continent . 
they come and go as naked as the day god created them .  .  . 
do they have such thoughts ? 
thirty seven ,  your majesty .  .  .  and you ? 
how old are you ,  senor colon ? 
a woman ? 
i know what i see .   i see someone who doesn &apos;t accept the world as it is .   who &apos;s not afraid .   i see a women who thinks .  .  .   &quot; what if ?  &quot;  .  .  . 
you show no inclination to speak otherwise ! 
may i speak freely ? 
surely you can do anything you want . 
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council . 
that she was impregnable . 
what did they say about granada before today ? 
the ocean is uncrossable ? 
no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors . 
i should not even be listening to you ,  since my council said no .   but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity .  .  .  and sanchez ,  that you are not a fool . 
you will regret this . 
you &apos;ll be held in detention ,  deprived of your privileges and possessions .   until you are returned to spain where you will be judged .  have you anything to say ? 
savagery is what monkeys understand . 
in one act of brutality ,  you have created chaos .   tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us !   all that because of your criminal savagery ! 
you did not hear me ,  don colon .   not my horse . 
don moxica  -  -  we all have to work . 
my horse doesn &apos;t work . 
we can &apos;t raise the wheel without it . 
we came here to stay !   to build !  not to start a crusade .   in this forest ,  there is enough danger to sweep us away in days !   so we will be brave and swallow our grief .   and in the name of those who died ,  we will accomplish what we came for . 
we don &apos;t need to know . 
you want a war ?   fine .   we are a thousand .   they outnumber us by ten !  who will you kill ?   which tribe ? 
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders ,  you &apos;ll do as i say . 
we lost cousins ,  friends .   we will wash this in blood . 
the indians have no such word ,  don moxica . 
and you say this is an indian vice ?  by god !   i don &apos;t see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin . 
we can &apos;t be . 
he &apos;s drawing an isthmus .  .  .  he &apos;s saying we &apos;re on an isthmus . 
what &apos;s he doing ? 
twenty eight . 
what do you read ? 
come over here . 
well ,  i surely know what a quadrant is !   but i &apos;ve never seen it used at night before . 
and what do you think mendez ? 
well .  .  .  it &apos;s the men ,  sir .   they wonder how you know our position .  we &apos;ve lost sight from land days ago .  .  . 
god be with us admiral . 
due west ,  captain mendez .   and may god be with us .  .  . 
you &apos;re right .   let the men decide . 
you tell that to them ! 
pinzon ,  pinzon .  .  .  all we can do now is go forward !   think about that ! 
you bloody .  .  . 
you never did .   you did all the talking for both of us ,  remember ? 
jesus maria !   i should have never listened to you ! 
and then what ?   half of the water has gone ,  the rest is nearly putrid !  you know that ! 
you don &apos;t know anything !   listen colon ,  these are my ships ,  right ?  so i &apos;m telling you we &apos;re turning back ! 
the land is there .   i know it ! 
we &apos;re lost ! 
you think i don &apos;t know that ? 
we &apos;re on the verge of a mutiny ,  colon ! 
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive !

is this true ,  brother buyl ? 
 .  .  .  but there is worse .   he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility .  .  . 
we weren &apos;t expecting immediate profits ,  were we ?   we must have faith .   we must give time for time . 
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying .   but with no gold !  the new world proves expensive ,  your majesty . 
yes .   it would be a pity ,  wouldn &apos;t it ?   call him back ! 
 .  .  .  into a monk .  .  . 
never ,  your majesty .   although .  .  . 
you were right ,  don sanchez .  .  .  his demands could never be granted . 
yes ,  your majesty . 
is that the man i knew ,  treasurer sanchez ? 
officers ,  there &apos;s your killer ,  do your duty ,  arrest him ! 
 .  .  . so we kill someone famous and if we are caught ,  we are sent to mental hospital .  .  . 
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s abuse ,  i think it &apos;s torture . 
i &apos;m abused .   don &apos;t you think ? 
can i see your back ? 
out on my back when i was a small boy . 
your father put cigarettes out on you ? 
that &apos;s what he did to me .   he put cigarettes out on me .

your father blamed you for your mother &apos;s blindness ? 
yeah ,  yeah .  .  . bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind .   and my father blamed me for her blindness .  .  . 
back in the czech republic ? 
yeah ,  she went blind giving birth to me .  she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me . 
your mother was blind ? 
my father always degraded me .   killed my self - esteem .   and my mother was blind .

i need to know about your background .   i need to know about your upbringing .   why you &apos;re here . 
what else do you need ?

thirty - percent .   no more .   or i call another lawyer .   this is the biggest case of your life .   don &apos;t try to negotiate .   thirty percent .   say yes or no . 
but it &apos;s .  .  . 
no .   no way . 
i would say .  .  . half .   half is fair . 
what &apos;s your cut ?   how much ? 
look ,  i haven &apos;t really focused on that kind of thing . 
what about my movie rights ?   book rights ? 
don &apos;t worry about him .   think about yourself . 
no ,  he is here .   shit .  .  . 
disappeared .   they &apos;re looking everywhere .   maybe he went back to czechoslovakia . 
what about oleg ? 
well ,  you didn &apos;t appreciate the severity of it until recently .   no question about that . 
i was all of these . 
 .  .  . delusions and paranoia . 
oh ,  sure .

i brought you some letters .   it &apos;s really fan mail .   women mostly .   one wants to buy you clothes ,  another sent a check .  another wants a check .

daphne ,  i .  .  . 
i don &apos;t want to drag you down with me .

pouring it out !

i &apos;ll get my clothes . 
i &apos;ll make some for us . 
in the kitchen . 
do you have coffee ? 
right . 
you better get packed . 
i &apos;m glad i met you . 
no matter what happens .  .  . i &apos;m glad i met you . 
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process .   eddie recommended one . 
if you were my boyfriend ,  i &apos;d suggest you find another girlfriend that isn &apos;t going to jail ten - thousand miles away . 
if i was your boyfriend ,  i might be . 
ludwig ?   he &apos;s gay  -  are you jealous ? 
is he your boyfriend ? 
i &apos;m sorry . 
i still can &apos;t believe eddie &apos;s gone . 
are you alright ? 
i &apos;m sorry .   i didn &apos;t mean to .  .  . i &apos;m glad .  actually i &apos;m glad it &apos;s over .   all this time .   hiding .   never being able to look anyone in the eyes .  always afraid that someone would find out who i was .   never trusting anyone .  .  . 
they &apos;re not gonna send you right back . 
you don &apos;t know .   i &apos;m sorry .   i was desperate .   that &apos;s not me .   i shot a cop .   can you imagine what they &apos;ll do to me when i got to prison ? 
i know . 
i &apos;m not a whore .   i &apos;m not a whore . 
i &apos;m just trying to find out who you are . 
what are you asking me ? 
so you were never a prostitute ? 
i came here .   i had no money .   i knew no one .   i couldn &apos;t get a job because you have to have a green card to get work .  they approached me  -  i could &apos;ve made a lot of money .   i considered it ,  but .  .  .  it &apos;s not who i am .   they pay me below the table at ludwig &apos;s . 
no . 
what about back home ? 
no . 
did you ever turn tricks before ? 
yes ,  i considered it . 
you considered becoming a prostitute ? 
yeah .   this way . 
so .  .  . the station is empty ? 
the men are out of quarters  -  practicing putting out fires . 
somewhere else ? 
i can &apos;t take you to my place . 
do you live alone ?   i &apos;ve been in these clothes since .  .  . the killings .   could we stop at your place ?  i could take a shower .  .  . before i go into custody ? 
divorced . 
are you married ? 
they won &apos;t until this is over . 
i will if they don &apos;t send me back . 
if you cooperate with the da  -  maybe they &apos;ll help you with your situation . 
now i become custody of police department ? 
yes ,  but he was a cop . 
alright .   that &apos;s a justifiable homicide . 
 .  .  . my little sister and i shared a flat  -  i came home one night and a man was raping her .   his gun was on the chair .  .  .  he came at me and i shot him . 
you &apos;re a cop  -  you &apos;ll never believe me . 
look ,  we can help you but right now we have to deal with what &apos;s happening here .  tell us the truth .  .  . is that the truth ? 
i &apos;m from a small town in slovakia .   like the south here .   the police is right ,  a civilian is wrong .   so i fled . 
a cop ? 
no ,  no ,  don &apos;t talk to immigration ! 
are you here illegally ?   don &apos;t worry about that .   we &apos;ll talk to immigration .  they won &apos;t deport you . 
arrest you for what ?   why would we arrest you ? 
if i tell you ,  will you arrest me ? 
whether you tell us or not ,  we &apos;ll find out .   better if it comes from you . 
go on . 
tamina was a friend of mine .   my shower was broken ,  she let me use theirs . 
c &apos;mon ,  start at the beginning .   you know these people ? 
i told your partner ,  i can &apos;t help .   i didn &apos;t see anything . 
yeah ,  sure .   beep me when you &apos;re ready for the press conference . 
i &apos;m ready to be briefed .   excuse us . 
oh yeah .  .  .  ?   alright . 
look ,  after jordy briefs me ,  you can do the press conference .   how about that ?  the case is all yours . 
well ,  i &apos;m the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i &apos;d like to be included in decisions . 
it was my decision ,  not his . 
oh . 
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .   get a good lawyer .   you &apos;re suspended until your trial . 
but chief ?   over this ?  ? 
how are you going to fight this ?   maybe if oleg hadn &apos;t gotten away and you &apos;d been on the front page ,  as a hero ,  this thing would be easier to fight .   you &apos;d have the good to weight against the bad !  it &apos;s unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there &apos;s nothing i can do !   gimme your shield . 
end my career ? 
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine . 
chief  -  i know i screwed up  -  but this guy was no innocent civilian . 
forgot ?   you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ?  ! 
what was i supposed to do ?   the guy tried to mug me .   i was gonna send a cop back  -  i just forgot . 
the public doesn &apos;t have any idea what we do and now you &apos;re going to define our image !   this is going to be our rodney king ! 
okay .   but not water sports . 
chief  -  mind if i take her ? 
oh really .   that &apos;s nice .   you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ?   are you out of your fucking mind ?  ?   are you having that much trouble gettin &apos; dates ?  ! 
no !   nothing happened . 
a shower !  ?   did you take one ,  too ? 
i let her take a shower . 
what do you mean ,   &apos;cleaned up ?  &apos;
ladder 20 was on the rock for training .  we stopped there .  .  .  so she could get cleaned up . 
i came to see how the investigation was going .   i called and you &apos;re not here .   i wait up at the station and you don &apos;t even show up !  !  !   i beep you  -  you don &apos;t return my call .   where the hell have you been ?  ! 
hey ,  chief ,  what are you doing here ? 
 &apos;cause we got more important things to do ,  like finding out who did it . 
then why didn &apos;t you talk to the reporter ? 
who do you think ,  chief ?  ! 
who did cause and origin ? 
yeah . 
alright .   swing by her apartment .   let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street .   you got that ? 
yeah .   he finished awhile ago . 
did the d . a .  videotape her deposition ? 
you do that ,  wiseguy .   now let &apos;s solve this thing before eddie flemming does . 
i said ,  yeah ,  you &apos;re right ,  chief .   as soon as we get somethin &apos; we &apos;ll let you alert the media . 
what was that ,  korfin ? 
yeah ,  right . 
don &apos;t you guys understand ?   it &apos;s all about image .   the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime . 
i know .   relax .   take it easy .   don &apos;t worry ,  we &apos;ll get those fuckers . 
he got my gun !   motherfucker was filming the whole time ! 
no .   i &apos;m okay . 
are you hit ? 
stay with her . 
the other side of the street .   the guy with the videocamera .   don &apos;t look  -  put her in the car .   stay this side . 
c &apos;mere .   you wanna go to homicide school ?   here  -  make yourself useful . 
yeah . 
only one guys checked in ? 
it &apos;s okay . 
sorry .  .  . pd only . 
still unknown but we &apos;re running prints .  kid over there caught the case . 
any i . d .  ? 
takin &apos; a bath . 
where is she ? 
a timer . 
what &apos;s he looking for ? 
you ready ? 
tomorrow .   at lunch . 
when ? 
i &apos;m gonna propose . 
what &apos;s the kid gonna say  -  sorry ?  meanwhile i &apos;m not here anymore .  like last week  -  we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up  -  spleen here  -  liver there  -  his heart in a pan .  six hours ago this guy was walkin &apos; his dog or buyin &apos; a quart of milk .   who knows ?   but some kid &apos;s robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can &apos;t tell if he &apos;s a piece of beef or a human being and i &apos;m thinkin &apos; that &apos;s me .  sooner or later .   that &apos;s me . 
it was freaky ,  i &apos;ll tell you .   stupid kid . 
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell ? 
vodka tonic . 
coffee for me ,  i gotta slow down . 
she washes hair up at ludwig &apos;s  -  a salon on 63rd and madison . 
he had a videocamera ?   where is she ?  quickly ! 
tall ,  short - haired ,  scary eyes .   second guy with him was .  .  . shorter ,  with a wrestler &apos;s build .   and he wouldn &apos;t turn his videocamera off me . 
describe him . 
he said he was her cousin .   i told him where she works .   they were just here . 
daphne .   another guy came in asking me about her ,  too . 
what are you saying ? 
boy ,  she &apos;s so popular all the sudden . 
did you tell him you did ? 
no . 
do you have any czech girls working for you ? 
yeah .   he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia ,  but i sent him honey  &apos;cause once they get there ,  you know ,  it doesn &apos;t really matter  -  honey was killed .  .  .  ?   poor girl .  .  . 
oh my g - d .   honey !   honey &apos;s dead ? 
we don &apos;t have her i . d .  yet ,  but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
homicide ,  miss hearn .   it &apos;s detective eddie flemming .   open up . 
i have nothin &apos; to say .   if you wanna contact my attorney .  .  . 
police .   we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions . 
who &apos;s there ? 
you know ,  i don &apos;t know .   i like you .  you remind me of a puppy i used to have .  he pissed on the rug all the time ,  but i still kept him . 
why &apos;d you help me back there with the chief ?   why &apos;d you stand up for me like that ? 
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer .   here ,  here &apos;s a number of an immigration lawyer .   that &apos;s how you help her .  but you can &apos;t get involved in her like that .   you &apos;re gonna jeopardize your career ,  your life and you &apos;re gonna jeopardize my case .   and lemme give you another piece of advice .   maybe you don &apos;t watch tv but i &apos;ll let you in on a little secret  -  the whole fuckin &apos; world watches television .   and when you get out there ,  they know your face .   and the little fame ,  the little fuckin &apos; itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job .   and i get more done because of it . 
but ,  i mean ,  didn &apos;t you ever go out on a limb for somebody ?   i mean ,  you shoulda heard her there .   tellin &apos; her whole story .  .  . i believed her . 
well ,  it &apos;s not up to you to decide whether she &apos;s innocent or not .   don &apos;t you understand ,  that &apos;s why you &apos;re a professional . 
i told you ,  you know ,  i thought i was doing the right thing ,  you know ,  i think she &apos;s innocent . 
no ,  i don &apos;t think you were a fool ,  i just think you were stupid about it .   i mean ,  to say the least ,  you outta know better .   you don &apos;t know her well enough .  she &apos;s got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her ,  it &apos;s fuckin &apos; over .   you can deny it all you want ,  but it will not make one fucking bit of difference .  you &apos;re dead . 
yeah ,  just her in the shower .   nothing happened .   look ,  i &apos;m sure you probably think i &apos;m a fool and i fucked up ,  but .  .  . 
just a shower ? 
i took her there for a shower and that &apos;s it . 
well ,  you shoulda because nobody &apos;s gonna believe you didn &apos;t .  .  . including me . 
look ,  eddie ,  i &apos;m tellin &apos; you  -  i didn &apos;t touch her . 
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs . 
hey .   i &apos;m a professional . 
okay ,  tell you what ,  i &apos;ll give you a head start .   you take her to the station house .   don &apos;t let her out of your sight .  she &apos;s the only warm body we got left . 
you know what i &apos;m saying here . 
you &apos;re her savior ?   is she the kid you &apos;re gonna save from the burning building ? 
c &apos;mon .   you intimidate her  &apos;cause you &apos;re a celebrity .   she sees me differently . 
so am i . 
i &apos;m serious here . 
my point exactly . 
i don &apos;t have a girlfriend . 
what would your girlfriend think of that ? 
yeah . 
you wanna talk to her alone ? 
look  -  let me talk to her .   any leads i get ,  they &apos;re all yours .   just let me have a first crack at her . 
raw deal . 
she &apos;s fucked .   even if that story is true . 
something back home ? 
why not ? 
is that all there is ? 
she just saw two of her friends killed !  they probably threatened her . 
what are you hiding ?   why are you afraid
then i guess we &apos;re doin &apos; this the right way ,  aren &apos;t we ?   if we pull up to a burning building i &apos;ll gladly let you go first . 
i wanted to run up to a building on fire ,  kick in the door ,  rush into the smoke and save a kid . 
hey !   i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid .   i dreamed of running up to a door ,  kicking it in ,  pulling my gun and yelling  &apos;freeze !  &apos; at the bad guy !  what &apos;d you dream about ? 
of course . 
so am i .   alright ,  i &apos;ll go inside and you cover the back . 
i &apos;m on duty . 
you thirsty ? 
i &apos;m on my way with eddie .   ludwig &apos;s .  63rd and madison .   the suspects might be there already . 
leon  -  meet us at 63rd and madison .  hair salon .   ludwig &apos;s . 
better than one . 
two heads . 
i &apos;ll call it .  .  .  tails . 
tell you what  -  i &apos;ll flip you a coin .  if you win you can come with me .   if you don &apos;t win ,  you don &apos;t come . 
this is ridiculous .   i &apos;m not gonna be in your way  -  we can talk the case over . 
i &apos;ll let you know what happens . 
but what if it does ?   you might need my help . 
this has nothing to do with your fire . 
mind if i ride along with you ? 
you got any better ideas ? 
you goin &apos; to the escort service ? 
stay here . 
my folks are . 
you &apos;re polish ? 
my parents are from poland .   i can help with the eastern european angle . 
this isn &apos;t homicide school . 
i can watch you ,  eddie .   maybe i &apos;ll learn something . 
there wasn &apos;t a fire .   there &apos;ll be nothing for you to do . 
i &apos;ll come with you . 
or czechoslovakia .   the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years .   these are very intense people and they take things personally . 
eastern europe .   like what ?   romania ?  hungary ? 
maybe it &apos;s a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message .   burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe .   it could be to humiliate them .  just burning them up ,  no proper funeral ,  it &apos;s like condemning them to hell . 
look ,  i &apos;m not even sure she has anything to do with this .   i saw her outside after the fire  -  thought it was a lead .  maybe she saw something .   maybe she was visiting somebody here .   who knows ? 
what would you call her ? 
who says she &apos;s a suspect ? 
maybe you don &apos;t care about that either .   prettiest suspect i &apos;ve had in awhile . 
hmmmm . 
pretty . 
the super said he &apos;d seen her before but she didn &apos;t live here . 
you were right ,  they were both dead before the fire .   the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine .   that &apos;s usually an indicator of something personal . 
if you found me steppin &apos; on your crime scene  -  it might piss you off ,  too .   what about the report ? 
sure .   but i would like to ask you something .   you got a problem with me ? 
did you get a report from the m . e .  ? 
good .   good .   commendable . 
i don &apos;t even watch tv . 
nah ,  why should you ? 
well ,  just so you know ,  i don &apos;t care about that stuff . 
well ,  just so you know .   i gave you guys the credit . 
nah ,  i musta missed it . 
watch the news ? 
it &apos;s your crime scene now .   you can do what you want . 
why don &apos;t you explain it ,  bobby .   hey camello !   you mind punching a hole in the floor ? 
no ,  what is it ? 
you know what that is ,  right ? 
no ,  we don &apos;t mind .   you mind leon ? 
hey ,  that &apos;s great you guys got it all wrapped up ,  but you don &apos;t mind if we go through the routine ?   it gives us somethin &apos; to do . 
smarter than americans .   you &apos;re fed cry baby talk shows all day long .   not only will americans believe me ,  they &apos;ll cry for me .   so .  .  . detective eddie flemming ,  would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ?  maybe you can propose to her now ? 
you really think you &apos;ll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ?   how fuckin &apos; stupid are you ? 
if you kill me and film it you &apos;re putting a noose around your neck . 
so tabloids don &apos;t have to do re enactments .   they going to have real movie this time . 
good  -  be tough to the end .   actor who plays you will want to die like hero . 
then do it ,  asshole . 
i kill someone famous . 
what &apos;s your accomplishment . 
your opinion .   you see ,  they going to make a movie about me ,  too ,  eddie .   and write books . 
what do you want ? 
so .  .  . who &apos;s nicky ? 
don &apos;t be late . 
thank you . 
see you later .   good luck . 
okay . 
yeah ,  yeah .   good thing . 
okay .   and you know what ,  i &apos;ll swing by my place ,  grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours .  .  . how &apos;s that .  .  .  would that be a good thing . 
yeah .   i promise . 
you promise ? 
tonight . 
okay ,  til tonight . 
i love you . 
patronizing you .  .  .  nay ,  i love you . 
yeah .   i &apos;ll do that .   as long as you &apos;re not patronizing me . 
i promise .   we &apos;ll talk .   you &apos;ll be great .   you &apos;ll be fine .   go ahead ,  just imagine that ,  uh .  .  .  just look into the lens and imagine you &apos;re talking to me . 
promise ? 
i &apos;ll tell you tonight .   let &apos;s do it tonight .   as soon as you get back we &apos;ll talk .   we &apos;ll talk . 
no .   no ,  listen to me here .   i want to know what you &apos;re talking about .   you know ,  the shoe thing and the marriages and .  .  . 
no .   go ahead .   you &apos;re gonna be great . 
okay .   that is great .   but i can &apos;t go now ,  we &apos;re in the middle of something here . 
well ,  that &apos;s great . 
yeah . 
that &apos;s good . 
oh my g - d ,  they want me to anchor .   they want me to anchor tonight ! 
okay .   okay .   hold that thought just for a second .   they only call me when it &apos;s an emergency .   just hold that thought .   can you call back ? 
answer it . 
no .   tell me what you want to say . 
answer the phone . 
don &apos;t worry about the damn phone .   i won &apos;t answer it . 
jesus .   and last week you came over with blood on your shoes .   what am i going to do with you ? 
could be leon &apos;s . 
look at this .   you have blood on your shirt .   whose is it ? 
you &apos;re not so bad yourself . 
you &apos;re ruthless . 
well ,  who was it that taught me how to do that ?   huh ? 
you were merciless .   you didn &apos;t give a shit if you got me or not . 
that was good .   you were holding the evidence . 
yeah ,  well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence .   that was .  .  . 
yes you are .   i &apos;m not just some reporter .   i don &apos;t just stick a microphone in your face .   you could give me something . 
i &apos;m not . 
alright ,  alright ,  eddie .   don &apos;t patronize me . 
maybe i should just ,  ya know .  .  . turn to the cameras and say ,  do you mind if we just work something out ? 
stop it . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .   did i embarrass you ,  sweetheart ?   oh .  .  . 
you didn &apos;t have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues .   you could give me something . 
i can &apos;t .  .  . i can &apos;t answer you just because you want me to answer you ! 
what is your problem ?   why &apos;d you snap at me ?   i just wanted a statement . 
hey . 
hey ,  honey . 
okay . 
alright . 
alright . 
alright ? 
alright . 
yeah .   now &apos;s not a good time . 
eddie ,  are you okay ? 
alright ,  cut ,  cut ,  cut . 
um .  .  . now is not a good time ,  okay .  detective jackson &apos;s hurt .   he &apos;s fine .  i &apos;ve got a fire marshall shot ,  detective jackson is hurt but not seriously . 
do you have the suspect in custody ? 
he was hurt ,  but not seriously .   he &apos;ll be fine .
