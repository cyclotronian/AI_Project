The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Sure have.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
You know Chastity?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Where've you been?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
In 9th.  For a month
But
Let go!
I just wanted --
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
What makes you think he'll do it?
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
You need money to take a girl out
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Who's that?
He always look so
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
You're not okay.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Kat! Wake up!
No, you weren't
Who?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there --
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Good call.
No, I won't go with you
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Tempestuous?
Say it
What?!
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You're completely demented.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
She said yes.
How far from here?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
What does he say?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Why do you wish to sail west?
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
All of them!  Just lies!
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Where can I meet this man?
You bloody...
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Your mother was blind?
I can't take you to my place.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Is he your boyfriend?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Any I.D.?
Only one guys checked in?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
I don't even watch TV.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Promise?
Are you married?
This all you want?
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
I did.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
It's easy to learn.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
Well, he killed my partner!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah?  What kind?
CONTINUED
It's about my salary cheques.
Oh?
Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
CONTINUED
CONINUED
When are you coming home?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Really?
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Roger.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
This is three years old.
I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Yeah, I noticed...
You're crazy.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
We eat when I say we eat.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
Just tell me about the money.
He's after your money.
Where's the goddamn car?
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
What?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
We missed.
Notice something funny about that bus?
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Thanks.
Yeah...
How did they get away?
Who are all these?
What am I wanted for?
I'm all wet.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Hello.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Whaddya think?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Stall.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
What're you laughing about?
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Where's Leeloo?
I don't have time... I need to know.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
Hello?
Eto Akta Gamat!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Apipoussan?
You get that off the screen?
It's not?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
You're killing me...
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
What are these for?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Friend of yours?
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What's he talking about?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
How long you been working there?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
He's odd.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
He succeeded.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
You don't have any other choice.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Okay.
Yes... ?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Why do you think he did it?
Hello... ?
I remember.  You just left...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
You alright?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Kristen, what happened?
No...
How long have you been awake?
You look great!
Rick, please.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I'll tell you later.
Feeling better now?
You don't get it, he's after me...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, beautiful.
How was the meeting?
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
You think that's the place she's buried?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Then get out!
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Where are you going?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
You, too?
You could train someone else.
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Cyclops?
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Dave - !
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
Why?
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Chub says you're fired.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
I used to play ball.
Double A. New Britain.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Don't mind if I do.
Where'd you get the blood?
I'm fucking out of here.
Why do they do that?
But it's not funny now.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Jesus, why?
Are we going in this?
What do you want, then?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
You're a policeman.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
Lillian!
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
No problem. Look, I...
I'm sorry about what I said.
You don't mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Money.
Oh, Wade.
Coffee's perked.
It makes me sad.
What the hell are you talking about?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Just do it.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Find them everywhere. 
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
He didn't leave us.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Put your pilot on.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Leave my daughter alone.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
Elaine.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Are you afraid?
Ted, the lever!
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Roger.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Can I hold him?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Captain Oveur?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Striker.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
You've been hurt.
Do you want to talk about it.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Both pilots!
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
What's the matter?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Airsick?
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
We have clearance, Clarence.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
William Harcourt?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
He didn't recognize me.
What is this?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
What is this?!
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
You think this is the guy who did it?
That where Anderson worked?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, I heard of it.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
Ripley...
That's right.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
What is it?
So.
Yes, Hicks?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Thanks.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
What did you think of the music?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
No! I won't have him back.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Why?
Where?
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
No, I'm not playing this game.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Why not?
Go back to bed.
Really?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Alone.
This is not his handwriting.
I see that you're expecting.
I said play!
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
What a charming idea. May I see?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
A-flat, Majesty.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Why not?
You don't have secrets from me.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
What?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
With all my heart, Mozart.
What happened? Is it over?
I do.
What?
Strange!
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
I do not seek forgiveness.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
Yes.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Are you absolutely sure?
Where?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Yes.
And what else?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, why?
Yes, go on.
What?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
I'm a werewolf.
It's nice to see you.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Feeling better?
He all right?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
All right, you two, move along.
Now see here young man.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Jack.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
That's a wolf's head.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
What the hell was that all about?
Beware the moon?
Could be a lot of things.
No, but he was on the moors.
Shit! David, what is that?
Oh shit. What is that?
See anything?
Where are we going?
David! You're hurting my feelings.
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Do you have any hot soup?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
Oscar, what's the matter?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
What good will that do?
Oh!
Thanks.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
What do you mean?
What's this?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me
Shall we let the people come in?
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Yes, of course.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
I don't know.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
I already told him I was home.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
I'm afraid so.
Yes.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh, Matt . . .
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Everybody in?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I'm sorry, Cole.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
But if we take their money and supplies...
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Not now.
She had a moustache.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
What are you saying?
Fine. We hit this bank.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Well?
What the --
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Jesse.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Of St. Louis?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Distracting enough for you?
That would have made an impression.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
How'd it go in there?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
You've killed your fair share of men.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Did you kill Yankees?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Was it worth it?
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Really?
Really!
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Parker.
What is that?
This is him.
How did you know?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Uh huh.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out.
It's a plain end. I think.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Why don t you just go for Price?
We need to talk.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Doesn't he live here?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Carnes? Wait.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
Oh, something. . romantic?
Yes?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Patrick?
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Well...
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Yeah.
She's my...cousin.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Where did Paul hang out?
He had a yacht?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
No hash browns?
Yes.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Speak up. Come on.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
He's your boss. He's not your --
They hack into people's programs?
You think I don't know that?
Great!
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
That'll be a test, won't it?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Longitude 109 --
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Did you wanna be alone?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Do we post it on the Net?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Time?
How close are you?
Why were you so careless?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
...He knows.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Care for some saki?
Hungry.
Where am I?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Yes?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
My wedding tackle.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
I can't. You're drunk.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
Everything seems to be in order.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Right.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
What about his teeth?
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
And how do you feel about that?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Red ...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Quite a collection.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Such as?
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Steed, we really must be --
But why? What's the point?
And I suppose you're the knight.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
That's what we were working on.
Steed ... !
To kill me?
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
I told Mother I took care of you.
What's that you're wearing?
What is it?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
No, please! I beg you ...
One shot -- for emergencies.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
All right!
Rick, I want to talk to you.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Fine. How's everything going?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
God, you're a slob.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Let go of me!
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Why is Cole here?
I hope Ilene's all right.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I just want to be alone.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Mrs.?
Right in there, pal.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
You think that's really any of your business?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
What the hell are you doing here?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Aren't you even curious?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Who's going to die?
Dad!
He just wants to --
They're waitin' man.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
-- Burn them.
Alderman Swayzak.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Yeah.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
He gots to be did.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Well you did.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Seconds and thirds, too.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Good morning, Cheeba.
No offense.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
My tap shoes.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
How long has my father been like this?
So what's up with you?
How did you know?
Sounds risky to me.
You've said that already.
Just want to say good luck.
For what?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
This is crazy.
Don't make me have to use this.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Where are you from?
Yes you!
You sing and dance?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I don't know who I am.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
You don't read, do you?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Good day to you, young sir.
Where are you bound for?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Never.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Why are you shaking?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Yeah, if you've slept.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You too?
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
We don't need the tapes --
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Where have you been, Jay?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Why?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
His chest was hamburger --
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Where are they!
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Stay where you are.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Hostile and uncooperative.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Are you sure?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
So what now?
We need to talk --
Do I have a choice in this?
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Tell him to shut up --
What do you think?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Bloom like a flower?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
Or are you too scared?
Fine, you do it.
Bloom!
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
How would you describe him?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Helping people makes me happy.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Spooning the sherbet.
You're not trying to run away?
The one about the witch.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
She was a witch.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
I'm sorry.
You don't even know me.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
This is it? The whole vault.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
It's bad.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
What happened?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Was she one of your teachers?
So you never bought any land.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Hello.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
"Frenzy".
They go. John. They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
In every sense. If at all possible.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
So uh...
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
You are throwing me out.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
When? Now? Oh. No.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
The fuck you laughin' at?
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Where's Ronnie?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
I said... STOP!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
You take it straight?
Want another?
Tell me what to do.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
I don't want you to let go.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
How a girl get like that?
You get a call from Rose?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I feel better. Do you?
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
You got any money?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
What happened?
What'd I tell you?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Yakuza.
She disappeared... shit!
Nick --
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Ich said you left.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
She ever pull down her shades?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
And I'm supposed to care?
They want your autograph.
We're police officers.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
What's the point?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Would you like to be modified?
I've done some questionable things.
When?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Well, when do you get paid?
You start.
I like you.
What's that?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Taffey Lewis?
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
Book the good ones for where?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
Are you for real?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Do I make you nervous?
I can imagine.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Is this to be an empathy test?
But in your profession that is a risk.
She didn't know?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Same thing.
Where are your folks?
Whatcha doin'?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
What makes you think so?
This is my new friend...
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
My office.
Well, that depends...
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Right.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
I think it's the eyes.
...Okay.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
It didn't used to be that way.
When do you need her by?
Where's he gone?
He has a computer?
The guy with the underpants!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Hey, Eve!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
No!  Not crazy!
Okay. I like that.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
...the pipe tobacco.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Uh-huh.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
I love Lucy!
What's the capitol?
This must be very new.
The recovery is very impressive.
Why did you park way back there?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
What?  What is it?!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Hello.
Dad!
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Yes!
Calvin?!
Watch this!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Calvin!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
What are you bitching about now?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Stop it, you two!
I see "elegant."
Alright, I will.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
What's that mean?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Yeah! That's thinking.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Frank. Come in.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What color is it?
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
Do you like talk like that?
I made it go down the toilet.
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
It used to make me laugh, but.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Shut up.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hello, daddy.
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
I don't want to go.
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
I'm going out for awhile.
God, you scared me.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
How ya doin' Dad?
How is Central these days?
What else is new? Right?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
Brilliant.
That sounds good.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
You want to tell me about it?
Did you see her undressed?
Who, me? Why should it?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Jeffrey!!
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Look under the body.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Anybody you think is evil?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
What are you saying?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
They got nothing.
Hello.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Would someone please come over here and...
me up the...
Absolutely not.
So what do you think?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
She was in here when it went down.
They were wearing masks.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
So what are you thinkin' here?
Hello?
Liberating isn't it?
We'll keep going, Roc.
What is it my son?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Did you see that?
Loop around real fast.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Holy shit.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Why not?
What about them?
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
She's from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
He's gone. He stole the car.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Who's in the car?
You're all clear.
Freeze!
Who tripped the alarm?
What?
So how is it in there? 
I think I may have found a way out of here.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Are you serious?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Anthony, I --
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Yeah.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Is that him?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
They are.
What the fuck possessed you?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
How long has he been in there?
What do you mean get back?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
You said 48 hours!
Come on, Bob.
I couldn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Do you have your own room?
How long do you have to go?
And what does that cover?
He left his sweater.
Is that your chiquita?
You a good pool player.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
-- it hasn't been two years --
It's just a nightmare.
Sleep. Sleep now.
That's crazy.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
I wanted to kill him.
Why is she trying to kill me?
Say it.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
What do you want?
Where am I?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
-- go -- take the van! --
What kind of problems?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Some women like Dobermans --
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
When will his trial be?
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Keep these. We're going too.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
We must run in different directions!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Where is my son?
Thank you for accepting.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
You will die! It will be awful!
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Why? What for?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Darn it!
You know the answer to that.
All the dads are gonna be there.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Just. Like. Jason.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not since we were kids.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
There's one major hole in your story.
Where are we going?
I don't get it.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Just get out, didja?
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Goodnight.
Hello, Rick.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
You haven't heard my offer.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Do you know where they are?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
I don't understand. What about you?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
I must find out what Berger knows.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Ilsa, I --
Yes.
-- Is what?
Hello, Rick.
And I congratulate you.
Good evening.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
But we made a deal.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
No, Captain, please.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
This is the end of the chase.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Where were you last night?
Give me another.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too little you'll die.
Get water!
What are you doing?
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Yeah, a long one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Merry Christmas eve.
You know, for when you travel.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
What's that, written on the sail?
There was a coffin?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
I am one lucky guy.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
When'd you start working here?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
You fucked us over.
And never take.
Forget it.
That's why you're a gambling man.
For the third time.
Hello?
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
I beat the odds!
This stinks really bad.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Thanks.  For everything.
May I ask, where are you bound?
He'll need clothes... some money...
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
I mean your parents.
And that I can drive a truck!
Where's Mandalay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
I know, I'm sorry.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
I'm okay--I can walk.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
Did you know your mother better?
Did you grow up around here?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
They're migrants.
So. What should I do now?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
There was no visible wound?
It looks like scurvy.
It's obviously an aborticide.
I am not a doctor.
Do you like to read?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Do you know him?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Then it's malaria?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Don't this place look like home?
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
The Anti-Christ?
But there were other factors.
Nice.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
We'll take care of it.
Fuck that. We're going too.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Shit.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
How much?
Listen, Scooter --
Come on. Harder.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Sorry, I --
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
You told me to change my hair!
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Tick-tock...
It's bad luck.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
King ain't gonna like this.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What happened?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Ten percent.
Speak.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
You sell it.
What are you doing?
Three years, two months. March '93.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
What?
Great.
To coincidence.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Do you believe in astrology?
What happened?
I'm in trouble.
I know that. But you can now.
They mean it.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I want you to forget what I said.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
Who are these guys?
Hey Jack, join us.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Girlfriend?
You can start Monday week.
That hair will have to go.
How do you feel, Jack?
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Fuck that shit.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Snap out of it, bomb.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
-- automatic channels open --
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle! Help me.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
Sir?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
What?
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Move it.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
I know.
Girlfriend?
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
The other one like you...
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I'm sorry.
Well, not me personally.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
With your help.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Thank you.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Please...
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Huh?
What the hell is that?
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
No... You don't think...?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
I got...
They're not idiots.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Yeah.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Hi... what's going on here?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
How much longer is this gonna last?
Wanna walk me home?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
That was a compliment.
That's alright... I understand.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Hey.
What?
Come with me.
People aren't that simple.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Know what?
Who is Frank?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Who is the boss?
A sign from whom?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Nothing.
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Our son just called me a bitch.
How did this happen?
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
What is wrong with you?
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Oh, Amber...
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Mom!
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
This, this... This is bullshit!
What're you doin' here?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi...
Okay... well, bye.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
This is -- what?
I will if you shut your piehole.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
What kind of a dog is he?
What do you whistle?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Oh no, I can't do it.
What other job you got?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
That's what you think.
Give me that again!
Was it -- swine?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
But -
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Did it go well, darling?
More romances for John?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
This man belongs in hospital.
Never mind that, I want my man!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You've acquired a taste for this?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
What is it, Treves?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Romance!
Have you read it?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
What's this?
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Who are they of?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Won't come out, eh?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
Open up! I know you're in there!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Erik. You don't understand.
The second note.
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Is there nothing men can do?
No. 
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
But it IS! Look!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Scream.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
Halfdan the Black's here!
I... I... KILLED her...
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Row!
You need to say a bit more than that!
ROW!
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
How did he do that?
Are you all right?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Together we stand!
Made by YOU, Loki!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did my father and his father before him.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
There is nothing we can do...
And keep your sword greased.
Thanks, guys.
May I help you?
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
Come up to Boston with me?
I'm sorry.
Why what?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I don't have one.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
What do you want to hear?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Yeah.
How can you watch this crap?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You're drunk.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Cool.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I knew.
Listen, did you want to make love?
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
I just got in.
I might be making a mistake.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Clementine.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Definitely!
Boo.
See you later, alligator.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yup.
Hey.
What do you want, Stan?
Howard, your one o'clock.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
That's lovely.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Stan? What's going on?
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Oh, hi.
The voltage looks fine.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
What was that?
What do you believe in then?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
Where are the others?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
No, I guess not.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
It's holding... She's holding...!
Coffee.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
What, Justin, what shows you?
What does?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
It's insane.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Weir is dead.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Thank you.
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
You've got to listen...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
He served on the Goliath.
Can you see a body?
Almost got it.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
What is it?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
Where is Reed?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
It's about to be a broken face.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Reed?... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Now what is up with that?
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Stop it.
You two need a time-out.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Front page?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
It's just business.
Victor, your scar --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Easy, mon.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Any problems?
Leave me alone!
Jeff you have company!
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Hey, Mike?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Did you get her number?
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Mark. What happened to your date?
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
My brother is gonna shit.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Does that ever happen?
I paid for it and everything.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Is this your first time?
What's April 16th?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Rum and ice, please.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
How long do I have?
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
You degenerate pig!
Lucy.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
Read the newspapers.
Like big lizards.
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
The airport is over there!
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
I will not die because of him!
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
What now, Geronimo?
We're going to get help.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Will I go crazy or something?
Doesn't your foot hurt?
He's dead.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
Nine?
I wouldn't do that, son.
'Eh, Chief?
NO, but I will lock you in.
Shit!
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
HELP MEEE!
DON'T!
Hold it!
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
You're afraid!
Okay, but come here first.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
You learn your lines?
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
...Don't you?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Of course.
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
What?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Well? What'd you think?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Frances...
Oh no...
Shit. I meant the other way around.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
What's left of my blood.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
There's just one more thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Pretty morning.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Did you expect him to look you up?
That's me, Clifford.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Huh?
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Why?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
I should go. I should leave today.
He always was opinionated.
Have you seen Willie?
Father's so proud.
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor!
A warming wind.
Henry Clerval.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
That's blasphemy!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Quite a place.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Preposterous.
Re-configure the leads?
Your men are right to be afraid.
What'd you see?
You draw very well.
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
How the... did he get in there?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
How come?
I'm sorry.
Somebody's there, Barry.
You just had some lucky shots.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
You said it was just you and your son.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Why do you want to stop?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
What about Kate?
What's your name?
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
She's dead?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Then?
Why are you so agitated?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
To your family.
What's this stuff?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
Not even for lunch?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Whiskey!
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Best in Mexico.
Gotcha!
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Got it.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
White House boys want a private meeting.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You'll think about my offer?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
So dump on me.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Which is guy-speak for...
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
At first.
Do you, uh, know...
Say again, sir?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
That's cuz I'm married to you.
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
I'll take them all.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
...he's pregnant.
You never said it was off the record.
You'd be surprised.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Really? A girlfriend then?
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Somebody must have seen it.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
We know.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I understand.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh my god, It's real.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
... Yes?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
... What does that mean?
A hologram...
I am SO SICK of being right.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Can it be repaired?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
I heard it too.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Explain -
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
What's going on?
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Anything.
Okay... On what?
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Continue forward, sir?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
Who is that!?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Let's not over do it...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
The British army, sir!
And how rusty are these muskets?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Martha... what?
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
But, you do come from a military family?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
General Greene?
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
What the hell are we doing?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
George, you know I only love you, but...
They can use their imaginations.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
My daughter, I ask only...
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
You see the paper?
Who?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
And that's for the airport.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
About sixty.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
You know how to write one of these?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
She's great. Gimme the money.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Or else what?
You say look at you?
Why would I do that?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
You mean, Leo?
Ever shot anybody.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
It was in the Herald.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You've been losing.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
I think it's not horrible.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I told you not to -
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Hello, Doris.
I don't have a dog.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Which two?
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
The turbine blew.
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Maybe that is his boat.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Did you?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
If you get it back in one piece.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
How much longer's that gonna take?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Bodies're too fresh.
That'd be my guess.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
Morning everybody.
That's a good thing?
What?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
You sure it wasn't me?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
It's not gonna hold us.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
What?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Ho-ly shit.
Oh, man.
We're still drifting.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Give up?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
What are you trying to say?
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
So Josh...
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
I just stopped in to say hi.
When did I say I hated you?
What? Why?
Why?
You can have that one.
Hey - why do you have this?
I want to do him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
Ew, look at this...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I totally, totally hate you.
Give me all your money, bitch!
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Hello?
Why? What did he say?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I dunno...
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
How much is this?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
How much is it?
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm totally serious!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
So is that your boyfriend?
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Jesus...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
You can open your eyes now.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I... I don't think so.
...What do you mean?
Uh... sure... come in.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Please Josh?
Maybe she's with Josh?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Seymour?
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
You've never built in Africa.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
What a good week.
Have you got it?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
How many do you think they've killed?
Good news?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Hello, Peter.
What do you think?
His name is Oscar.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Does she know anything about babies?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
What is it, honey?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
You've got to do something!
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
You were supposed to help me with this.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
From where -- Neptune?
Nothing.  Not a trace.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
I'm Ray --
What happened?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
What's your story, Pete?
Does it have any favorites?
You finished here?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Who's the stiff?
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
He is the Destructor.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
What's that got to do with it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Can I help you?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
May I please see the storage facility?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
You talked to Gozer?
What now?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Sorry, Buddy!
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
They will.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Ray -- Something's here.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Do you believe in God?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
For the gods, spit it out!
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
The Senators admire you.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
This is our oil from our estates?
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
Who the hell are you?
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Then get a large cash advance.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you always drive like this?
We won't. Let's go inside.
And it's all over now.
I do.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Is that him over there?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
-- really incredible --
What?
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Carl who?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Where are you?
Is it a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
I want to say something first.
How are you?
Well -- goodbye then --
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Well.
Yes?
Are you afraid of me?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
How do you get out of the house?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Why did you do that?
What was your major?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
What are you doing?
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
I don't believe you.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Oh, no.
Why did you say that?
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Why?
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Say that again.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
I know.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Hello.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
And what are you going to do?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I'll pay you back.
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
I'll do anything for you.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh!
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Why do you look at me like that?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
No.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
Do you understand?
Why later?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
I've no luck.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
It's always so quiet here.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Anyone asked for me?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Oh, I've got to find it.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
You dance splendidly.
What's the matter?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Moreover...
Skiing? 
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
I understand you perfectly.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Come here. 
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
I know you did -- I said you did --
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
How clear is Manchester?
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Motherhood.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Not much time.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
Perk, remember?
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Up to you.
No.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I didn't teach you that.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Big spender.
No.
What?
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
She didn't see you, in other words.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Don't I get any say in this?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
That's that, then.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Well, when you put it that way.
Carter.
That's it?
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
What the --
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
He found you, didn't he?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Thanks!
He do that to you?
Is Tim there?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
What if your parents come home?
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
What is it this time?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Come on!
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Miss me, baby?
Home is important to a man.
You know what gets me?
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I didn't tell you everything.
You know what gets me?
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I wanted to apologize.
What an awful sound!
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Sir?
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
No.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Can I get dressed first?
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
Not at all.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Disease?
We all are.
Please--
What then?
And what is his most cherished possession?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Unless she has nerve.
Two hundred years old.
You're begging him to kill you?
No you don't.
I'm going to call the police.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Help your mother find the bullet.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're a son of a bitch.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
What is this thing that kills me?
Don't shoot.
Can't do it.
So long, you guys.
Because he was cruel?
Kid--kid--
What's this?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Thank you, kind sir.
That's why I'm crying.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Yes?
I'm touched.
I wish Paul luck.
You fool, you fool.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Yeah.
Are you Niki?
It's your money. You talk.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Nah.
Of Joanne's?
Jesus.
You know what I'm talking about.
Say what?
No.
Neither am I.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
More or less.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Andy.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
In G.R.? Why?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
I'm only human, you know.
What are you doing here?
Do the police want to arrest me?
What happened?
How's your business, Jake?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Take it or leave it.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Fifty cents admission.
I thought you were a businessman.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
The guy who bought you that ring.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
You are at the University, Candy?
But there is a family resemblance.
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Because if you are...
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Here's your shovel.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Sort of.
All right.
All right.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Well, I really don't smoke.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
But they have.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Why?
How do you do?
Yes. It does.
No.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
You liked your teachers?
Then why did you leave?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
What would you say?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
How about to slit his throat?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Parasite!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Frank.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
And you're sure it was a woman?
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
O.K. Let's go.
Wait!
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
I need to touch it to "see"...
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
That's all for you, Sammy.
hound of resurrection --
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
How does he know so much about me?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
You're kidding --
Myers??? How's your arm?
What was that??
Are you sure about this?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hit me.
What's happening?
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Got her mother's looks.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
This isn't for real.
Nobody escapes us.
We've got such sights to show you --
You bastard --
Frank --
But you said --
...somebody...
I'm hurting
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
What happened?
What's the problem?
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Just a thought --
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You're done worse.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you all right?
-- I'll go see.
You know it's not often I... you know...
I suppose that's right.
Well, isn't it?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Who brought me in here?
What a pretty tune.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
What did you say?
I have to talk to you.
I'm afraid it's true.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Where are you going?
I'm here.
Not that late.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
What are you doing?
Play it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Yeah.
What are you snickering about?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Why would they care?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
Why not?
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Anna Moss.
May I help you?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is that it?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob --!
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
What is this.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
Did you say something?
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
You won't like it.
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Don't forget your CDs.
I guess I am.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Just local, of course.
Very persuasive.
About what?
Enough, Liz.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Are you okay?
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
That way.
And after that?
What do you think?
But you must have --
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
He was unsual.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Grave robbers?
Why not?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'd rather hear yours.
What's all that?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
He is older than I.
I didn't kill the watchman.
There are differences.
I haven't killed _you_.
What's wrong?
A murder.
I'm calling an attorney.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Stop.
I did at that.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Does it change with me in the room?
I'm twenty-two.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Spare a chair?
How are you?
I haven't drunk this much since-
You've been here from the start.
This your present address?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Who is it?
I'll keep you in mind.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
The five hundred? Sure.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Oh, she was here.
Did you give her the money?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Just for the first year.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
He's in the insurance business.
Then what does he want with you?
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
You said it.
Never mind that. What's the story?
She jumped out of the window.
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
All the words you've got.
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Then why are you doing it?
Sure.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
How about Bruce's?
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
They're always after me for interviews.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
So have we!
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
What a chase!
Just a minute, Johnson!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
What went off?
Where is he?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
No -- don't out me off.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Who is this man?
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I won't.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Who is it?
There goes another scrub lady.
Mother!
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What's that?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The City Sealer's office!
But how do I know...?
They wouldn't take it.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Baldwin -- his name is.
What's that?
That was a googly!
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Here's to music. And absent friends.
Has Sue got it right?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
And where do you think you're going?
I can't do it. What's the point?
It seems to have survived.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Which way?
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
Wondering what?
What the hell are you laughing about?
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
She's pretty cute.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Really fucking awesome.
What was that?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Go around him.
Check this out.
What are you doing!
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Huh?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Thank you.
What are you laughing at?
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
How long has it been?
I don't hear anything.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
Why? Why are you doing this?
We gotta break it open.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Hello, my little boy.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Fine.
What?
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Hunh.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
That's what I'm counting on.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
How'd you know where I was?
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Come on.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
For me.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Half.
The expensive kind.
He's my partner.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
How do you feel?
Quit. He's too good.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
When?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Who's he?
What's the limit?
How much you playin' for?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
How long have you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
Hey!
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I'm hungry.
Do you want me to go?
Give it back to me.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He's a gambler.
Well, what else does?
No, I want to walk.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Where do you come from?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
I came to play pool, Fats.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Are you all right?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What do you want?
I don't know.
Humans.
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Do you know how to follow a map?
Where, Jimmy?
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
Your father asked you a question.
You still believe in him.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
You saved a lot of lives.
What the hell is this?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
What're you talking about?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Not really...
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Not listed, huh?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
This I can see.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
How're we doing?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
This is ridiculous.
A meteor?
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
You scared the hell out of me.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
Damn it!
But I gave you some this morning.
I'm not leaving.
Call them back.
And before here?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Dad?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Schneider?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
Where did this come from?
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
What do you know about this place?
This one. I think he's in here.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Dad!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Found it.
They want my diary.
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
I ought to tell you something.
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
It's a new experience for me.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Interested in local curios?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Who?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Indy, look!
You don't look very good.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
India...
What?!
Can you move your arm?
What's happening?
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
What is it...?
Wait -- what're you doing?
What?
What're we going to do?!
Anymore ideas...?
The last Sankara Stone.
Where are you,...Al?
Who was it?
You're in my head...
Your name is Al...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah...Who?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
What do I do?
I don't know...To get Al.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
Sue them.
Door's locked.
Just walk down the hall?
I'm back.
You mean...just leave.
I don't have any.
I'll get in trouble.
They'll know who I am.
Do you notice anything.
Eat it?
I don't want to eat it.
It's sand.
What is it?
Help me out, will you?
Wait.
Where is she staying?
It worked.
Follow that busboy.
It's embarrassing.
You got any books in there?
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
Osaka.
What do I do?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Don't touch a thing.
Door to the right. Get up and run.
haka xuki.
He hung us up dry.
Holy...
Gimme a minute.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
What are you doing?
You just got a Mickey.
Doesn't matter.
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
What happened?
PEM115!
How about a deal?
Surveillance Cameras?
You have nothing...
Sir?
I don't want to intrude.
What brings you here?
It may have been affected.
You may not remember things.
When you remember...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Take the card.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Dinner...tonight.
Let you leave without it.
What's so funny?
What way?
I waited for you.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Why did you stay with me?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
You know where he went?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
Hiroshima.
And you?
Now what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
What did you tell them?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Just like that?
What could you find in this place?
You can't take that.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
When's your deadline?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
When's the air date?
Sure.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Do you want more rice?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
I'm afraid you are.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Yeah?
Why?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Why? Who said?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Thank you, Bob.
Jeffrey Wigand...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
I disappeared on you?
Give me a break!
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Who's that?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
...but that's as far as I go...
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
What did you get us?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff...
Good. But Jeff...
You attract a crowd.
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
That's not the point.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
Most certainly.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
What a touching story.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
You like kids.
You're vulnerable.
How do you know?
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Oh, for the love of...
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
To victory.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
Hmmm...
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
I don't believe you have "things."
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I fell in love Miles.
Hello Marylin.
Forgery and Fraud?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Miles Massey.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
...arty farty!
Did Marylin end up with money?
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
What's Kirshner?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Berry spoons.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
That's an evasion.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Peter Warne! 
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
What happened?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
What do you think you're doing!
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
Now, just a minuteyou can't
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I better go over and see her.
It takes money to buy food.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
What're you going to do?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
You're forgetting you're married.
Congratulations.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Where's the bus to New York?
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
What!
Huh?
You're drunk.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
You send telegrams here?
Send it collect.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Yeah.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
You know damn well who it is.
It leads farther than that.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
No.  Never heard of him.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
How many men are working with you on this?
Do you walk home?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
How old is that machine gun shit?
What?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Why were you with him?
Great, you're here.
What's she want?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
My pocketbook.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
But now you're telling us now you do.
Is it dark?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
What did they want to know?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
No, you didn't. What branch?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
If you're having some.
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
How do you feel about getting old?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I see.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
What do you do when he comes home?
You do that?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Most of the times.
I know what it looks like.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Uh-huh.
That would be one point of view.
I thought I did.
There was a guy with Melanie?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Yeah?
If you want.
No, I give it to someone else first.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Four years?
Is it ready to go?
Want a Metrix?
So where did you go?
About five years ago.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
He went to meet that stewardess.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
I didn't look like a bum.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
So what, you left her there.
You couldn't just hit her?
Came outta where?
Then what?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
I'm going out for a few hours.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Who's it for? A relative?
You didn't hear?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
You know who this is?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
My money's in that office, right?
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
I'm alive.
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Well, try, huh.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
There was a bang.
Don't go.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
I had this weird flash just then.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Jacob, what can I do?
I moved the couch. That's all.
That help?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I'm going home.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Why? What for?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
I can't do it.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Who else were you expecting?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Bullshit!
Where have they gone?
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Where's West? New Jersey?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
I can't move.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Where's Wong?
He's burning up.
He'll never make it.
Push 'em back.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Everywhere, like a plague.
The army?
I don't know. I don't know.
A car accident.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Where the hell were you?!!
Nice touch.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Hurry!
Earth II.
Get them in the lab!
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Sergeant!
Jesus, God!
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
I couldn't save them.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You wanna release your air tanks?
Did you like it?
You okay?!
I'll help you in.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
You must shut down the engines.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Jesus!
Barbie from hell...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
Do I have to?
I missed you too.
How do you know?
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
You're not going anywhere.
More soldiers?
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
What's that one, there?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
What about us?
Right.
Only 24 hours!
He lost it on the way up.
Got a pen on you?
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Wait a minute! I need you.
What's that, a ship?
Christine what?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
One more after this, then I'm going home.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Follow him!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
You know how I feel about her.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Charisma?
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
You're being really immature.
I still have your virginity!
Wait, let me take that.
You know it's okay.
I try really hard, actually...
Hey man.
Just like our moms and teachers!
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Nails? Really?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
When was this, like '96?
Oh.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Cute?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
You do?
Oh, okay. Like this.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
What...
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Yeah, like people in love.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
What?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
...Pardon?
Are you takin' the pictures?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
What?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Early, what're you doin'?
Where you from Walter?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie.
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
What's that?
Brian I want him out of our car!
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
What happened?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
She can fuck?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
78th.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
That.
Right.
So really, it's good luck.
Man, Telly, your little brother is getting big.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Casper.
Where you goin' tonight?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. Come on.
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
I'm sorry.
Miss, would I be prying?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Who, Benny's little sister?
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Yep.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Slow.
What man? What is it?
We seem to have a little problem here?
Casual.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Yes you are.
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
Sorry.
You still having a problem with this?
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
To get your attention.
You'll find her.
You know her?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
What scars?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
What is it, dad?
Any sign of rape?
What about prints?
Well?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
What do you see here?
Feel like practicing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
We need your help.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead after the game.
It wasn't intentional.
I think it's interesting.
No.
I know it was bad.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I'm hungry.
Peter...
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
Take the western passage.
That's a better one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
There is nothing.
You have not slept in two days.
I can't reach her.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
Do not let the waters touch you.
They can be saddled.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Let me comfort you.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
He will not!
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
Each to his fate, lad.
You see?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Take...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
When I say I love you.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
What if you don't make it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Mine.
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Walk with me?
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Most certainly.
Red flag, man.
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Are they standing?
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Is it a boy or a girl?
What's your shoe size?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Water?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
But it's a top three school --
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
What alibi?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
So everything you just said --
Was she carrying a weapon?
What's going on?
Uh -- both?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
God, that felt great!
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Our group is full.
I'm a bitch.
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Good luck.
Don't ask.
But maybe it's not what you think.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
So now you're -- ?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
What?
I did?
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
You're beautiful.
And I fully support that.
I completely agree.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
East coast people are different.
You go where?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
I didn't mean --
Thanks for the backup.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Hovering?
Fire moat... why do that?
We watch... good fun...
Like some vile toadstool.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
It's bluebells!
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
By the grace of God.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
This is ogre's magic.
I should hope not!
I pray always to be worthy of it.
God's blessing.
Wait!
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Can we trust him?
Water doesn't burn...
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
A good day for singing...
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
How're these?
A promise is a sacred oath.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
They tricked you.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Step lively now!
What's this now?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
How do I get the horn back?
Exceeding fair.
I don't believe you.
This is sad news, be it true.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
I'm promised to another!
Where?
Sorry, Jack.
Uhm... fine work.
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
In a dream.
Marco!
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
He's not there.
Do you guys feel like painting?
Mom?
Can you keep Sam straight?
You're a good girl.
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Where's your dad?
Really?
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Where are you?!
This is such a street of whiners.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Maybe...?
Well, it's the least I can do.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
I hate turkey.
No one would blame me if I left!
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
I'll have to pay him back.
Hi, Alyssa.
What would you like to be?
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I loved him too much.
After everything.
And you told Mom today?
What kind of house?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
Lock the door behind you.
He never answers.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
I love those doors.
It makes me sad.
I used to live here.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need help?
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I could die.
Don't move!
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
What are you talking about?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You never really trusted me.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Do you know anything about building a house?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
The door was open.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Sharp.
Married?
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Where they taking us, anyway?
What are they gonna do to us?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
That's some long green.
That's right, a loan officer.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
You're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What ain't there?
So?
This fork is filthy.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
You still got that map?
You drew this?!
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I know people.
You get ketchup?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Let it go, Claude.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
You sure it was him?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Where am I at, man?
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
I can't take that, mama.
Is everyone here?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Blacks welcome there?
ADRIAN!
Is this a joke?
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Valerie's crying!
Did you just talk?
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
This is bad, Nicky.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
What's with that guy?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Look who's back from the dead.
Looking for the chief.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
You gotta kill yourself.
Adrian?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Valerie?
Nicky!
Why is that funny?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Why?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Why did you do that??!!
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Where do you live, Mary?
When do you go up?
You prefer women?
You could have called me yourself.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I wish I could help you.
I'd rather be with you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
And Sanctuary?
Beloved husband...
I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Listen.
Why not?
You recognize that guy?
What's that, Ed?
Can I call you?
Pete?
You like it?
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
In pornos?
You liked it.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Are you my man?
Okay. Thanks.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
That's not Fred Madison?
Yeah, Mack?
When he went to work, right.
What's your axe?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
When you didn't come to the club.
From the club. You didn't answer.
You're up early.
What's that? Another tape?
Don't you want to watch it?
What the hell is going on?!
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
How ya doin', Pete?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Sheila...
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Sheila... Stop...
Cable from Gainsford.
Yes, sir.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
I say, good morning, Lovey.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
There you are!
Charming chap.
Chalmers Bryant!
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Cave, eh? Where?
And the wine - excellent.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Who?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
Just what I needed too.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
What's it mean?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
George, come back!
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
I'd go mad!
Maria?
You can't take her away from here!
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Thank you.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
What do you want him to do?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
You'll wait till you rot!
Thank you.
You shot an eight year old girl.
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
what's this?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
He's here to help!?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
What are you doing?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What the hell does that mean?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Did he say where?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
And they're buying it?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
I have to go back.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
John?  What is it?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
You the sentry?
You the only sentry?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Lara called me.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You're certain?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
You set me up...
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She spoke to me.
Wally, listen to me...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
I won!
Come on!
I was looking for you...
Sean, wait...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Do you know who I am?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
What about the picture --
Who made you do this?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
You're talking about the precogs...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Then how did he --
This is all my fault.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
Congratulations, sir.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Precog Deja Vu...
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
What kind of cop were you before this?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
What about your meeting?
This your work?
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any sugar either.
That was our apartment.
Since right after we lost our son.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
I don't get it. What do you do?
Is he cute?
Oh no. What is it this time.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
No.
What's wrong, baby?
You're not my daddy.
Hello.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
You talk to Max today?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Max offered to stake me.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
When's it going down?
So what do we do?
He must have that shit troughed.
Where we going?
You bet the ponies?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
A bad heart.
'Trustafarians?'
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Ask if he said anything to her.
We need guns.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I like it.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
It's ours.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
I'll get the girl.
C'mon, man...
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
This is bullshit, man.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Yeah. What vibe?
What are you doing.
We need guns.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Dude, we were practically made...
Hey, boys.
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
What's up, man.
Yes?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
Here they are, then.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
What about my keys?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
Who's gonna outfit us?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Scotland.
I'll get it.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
I'm wearing, Archie.
Man live by his rep.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
What did you give it to me for then?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What for?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Little.
I can't.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Did you hear what I said?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Dear heart, where are you?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Let him finish.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
You know that gal?
She know?
Is she hooking?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
That ain't bad.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Who the hell are they?
What am I doing here?
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[Senor?]
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
Deal.
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Drive.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
Who's he?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
Yeah, right...
How long you staying, Crease?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Creasy?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Did you like school, Creasy?
And don't start crying.
You're fast.
Well, I let him go.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You don't drink like you used to.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I don't believe you.
Where are you?
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
Bye, Mom.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Who's that?]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
You helped him get this job.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Waddaya gonna do now?
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Hey! What are you doing here?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
Oh.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Ah?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Marty...
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
Okay.
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
What do you want me to do?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Miss you, Walt.
Y'all mind the store.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
I have a tent to myself.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We think the same way.
Give us this day our daily...
Gimme three.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
I think I heard about that.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
He only lasted one season.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
See you.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
You really say the cutest things.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Yes, Reverend?
Why can't you look at him?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
O'Reilly!
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Sir?
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Huh?
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Ted Sheldon.
Did you write this?
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
All right, boys, here he is.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Hey, Boss.
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Racket? What do you mean?
Is there a crowd in the street?
No -- you can't do that.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
You can't kill me like this.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
How do you feel after a shooting.
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
We see each other every couple of months.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
I can't do that.
Get good at it.
What's the first commandment?
You know why I like the track?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Is the hostage injured?
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
That a new picture?
What do you think?
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
You like this place?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Yeah.
Tell him to give me a raise.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What have you promised them?
What do you want?
This is how you pick up women --
Where you plugged-in from?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Won't be time if he gets access --
What did he tell you?
Not his style.
Need the disk back!
I've got to get back.
But I don't know anything about programming.
And it meant something.
What?
What's so funny?
Voice activate.
Access granted.  Male or female?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
SKULL!!
Just shut your gap!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
How the heck?!...
I am the mighty ape!
THREE SECONDS!!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
I got my partner in there!
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
You here with Bobby?
I booked passage to London.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Who'll make the rules?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
Where we headed?
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And how many soldiers do you have?
He's an animal!
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
The terms will be mine.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Forget it.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
Who did this?
What?
What's the maximum safe dose?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
DEATH!!
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
What's the matter?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
You want to come inside?
So, what do you think?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
He seemed quite taken with you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
He's an organic farmer.
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
How about getting married?
Any time.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*You won't?*
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
I did. What about it?
A dirty frame!
Yes. Come in.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Certainly would, Joseph.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Whose statue is that?
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Committee.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Have you always had to--work?
Lena.
Already? All these letters?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Sure.
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
What! Who?
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Mr. President...
Senator Paine will state it!
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Pixilated.
He's still pixilated.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
In a day or so, I think.
The guy's balmy.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Look, I can do it!
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
That's the rub.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
How's it going? Okay?
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
How is this, sir?
We'll send for the police!
Relatives of old man Semple.
Nuisance value?
I can't find him.
Where?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Will you have a cigar?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Now, where were we?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Mrs. Semple?
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
A what?
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Proceed.
Uh-huh.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Tails tonight, sir?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Dr. Mumford.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
It was Henry Follett.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
And the Brocketts?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
What can you tell me about this?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
I'm not making any promises.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Please... forgive me.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Well, there's Lily.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Slash what?
Who else knows?
Did you carry a gun?
And the drugs?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
I never killed a priest before.
Goin' somewhere?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Why would I do that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
It's everybody's problem!
You...! YOU...!
Juicy?
That thing gives me the creeps.
None taken.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Do I?
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
Come on, baby!
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Eat your mustard.
Superheroes.
That boy's got talent.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Hi.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
So why don't you just tell her!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Or flowers.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
The who?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Jeffrey!
It's on the television.
Hi.
She likes you.
Don't crunch the leaves.
To us!
Where am I going?
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
You realize what is at stake?
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
No, they're living in Nice now.
My God...!  What time is it?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
When is she supposed to return?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Will you use the troops?
May I offer you a drink?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Who is it?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
You wrote it.
What was there to tell?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Me neither.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
What's crackin'?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
Blow.
What you see?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
What is it?
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Just do it.
William.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Mr. Nasty time?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Where to, sir?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
How do you know that?
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
Are you 'fucking with me!?
What about the gun?
What...?
How should I...?
Again.
I think you better put that away.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Ready?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
Oh, Jesus ...
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Get moving.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
He never told about the money.
What do you figure he done with it?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Here they come.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Leavin', boy?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
AAA-MENN!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
I tried to save her.
John...
It's all here.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I'll see to Pearl.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right boy: where's the money?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
How old are you?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
Mornin', ladies.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
This man down at the Drugstore...
What'd you all talk about?
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
How long's this been going on?
It's just a stupid cat.
What the hell's going on!?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Okay?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
She dreamed this would happen...
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Who? Who did that?
Where you think you're going?
Did you sleep?
Get into bed.
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Someone else was there.
And then what happened?
Do you think I did it?
What you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
No more fights?
What are you serving?
And you too, Ninotchka.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You feel it, though.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
He's cutting our throat...
That must be the one!
We had to take it on account of the safe.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Which lawyer?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
I am, Gaston.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Good evening, Your Highness.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Business.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
What for... why?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
What do we do now?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Then do it through my lawyer!
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Will you smile?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
I don't look too foolish?
You remember this room?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
How do you do?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Comrades! Comrades!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Our salute will be a kiss.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Oh, Leon!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Did I hear something about jewels?
What did he say?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Yes, Swana, you did.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
You leave me no choice.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
May I have your bags, madame?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
It's just a place for workmen.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
This is June twentieth?
Sorry ...
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
About a dozen.
Who?
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
I did?
Well, why not?
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Where are they?
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
What'd he say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
How the fuck did you know?
Mein Kampf?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
No, Henry.  I don't.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
The lie?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Jesus Christ!
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
You're not a failure, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
Tomorrow.
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How'd you know I was here.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How many a those things you got now?
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
He won't neither. He never has.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
Don't get hurt.
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
You gave your word?
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Llewelyn.
Odessa.
So... for how long do we have to...
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
And where is that.
Yessir?
Mm-hm.
What airport would you use.
Airport.
...I know where you are.
All right.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
This. And the gas.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
How's that?
Tent poles.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Then you'll like me.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
How is she?
...I meant your food.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
It wasn't a woman.
Jesus...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Oww, the arm, the arm!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
You're lying!
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
It's all right.
What?
I gotta go.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
She called you 'George,' George.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Your husband?!
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
The fuck you talking about?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
That is so right.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
It's not here. Let's go.
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I never said that I believed...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
What'd you get her?
Really?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Yeah? The sport utility?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
You lie, motherfucker...
That's right!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Izzat right?
Whuhh...
You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
'N turned into a frog -
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I counted to three, honey.
The preacher said it absolved us.
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Who's the honcho around here?
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Who gave you this idea?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Great ass.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Good morning, girls.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
No, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
No, sir!
Where are you from, boy?
What did you call me, Mayo?
How late?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Sid, there's no baby.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
How did it go with you guys?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
And you turned him down??
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
Jets.
Could you believe those girls!
Hey, you guys still awake?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You're welcome.
You should see the look on your face.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
The walls are steel, right?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
And we're never getting in.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
No, Edgar Allen.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Too many stairs.
Fuck him.
What do we do?
I heard you.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU HAVE TO!
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Not an option.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
You were. infantry right?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Yeah, I do.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
You got something on your mind... "brother."
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You alright?
Yeah.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
What news?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Did your father teach you humility?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
You don't hate him.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Don't touch him.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
How far away?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Is he really all right?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Yeah, sure.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
You need a glass?
What were you listening to?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Leave me alone!
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Well, honey...you know that...
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
I'll watch my back.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
Do you believe him?
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
That was before I met one, of course.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
Blast it, I'm already awake!
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
It's still against the law.
Is that so?
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
On what?
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Pollution?
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Do you think she will give us the designs?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Do you think she loves him?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Yeah?  So what?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
You're afraid of him.
Like Crazy Glue?
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Just like old times.
Do you have something to bring me down?
No cheese.
Susie... I...
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
I could have you fired right now.
Icky!
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
May I use your telephone?
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
I suppose you're going to print them?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Do you like them?
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
This way.
Yeah!
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
How's that?
Right - for the first time this year.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Well, when are you quitting?
What play?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
That's a lovely dress.
The boss is getting hoarse.
You what?
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Okay.
To Old Madrid.
Hey, Gallagher!
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
A statement? Good.
I suppose you know why I came?
I don't eat waffles.
Yes.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Stop calling me Mother!
And you struck him right here in our house?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
Shhh! Do you hear something?
It's haunted just the same.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
You sure you want to know this?
It's okay. It's alright.
Does it look okay?
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Oh, hi ...
Where'd you get this?
What?
Wait ...
I told you where I was.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
But where would we go?
It's six-thirty ...
I don't believe it.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
I think I've got something to say.
It's like the basketball team.
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Hello Bud.
What are you doing?
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Oh God.
What did you do to him?
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
You got the admissions letter.
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Sure ... Where would we go?
So what's it like?
How?
I like calling you David.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Yeah ...
I had nothing to do with that.
EXCUSE ME?
There's worse places.
Do you have the lettuce?
Bud ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Oh, hi.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
It's beautiful.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Free?
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Yes, I'll be there.
...yes I'm still on hold...
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
What's the listing?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Really?
No.
Hi....what....what's up....?
Yes.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Are you telling me no?
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
How long have you known her?
You like her?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
I don't freak out very often.
Hello?
Yeah?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Where do you have to go?
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok.
Why?
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
You want her to call you Jack?
I'll say whatever I want --
Sorry about that.
Yeah.
Mhm.
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I'll see you there.
What's the problem?
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
I must grant him his last rites.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
And --?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
They can't be serious.
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
It's no secret that you loved her.
Abbe de Coulmier!
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
As you say, Doctor.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
You're just scared.
That poor woman.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Marion--
This picture--
I just want to understand--
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Hearst?
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Sigmund Freud?
The great Spanish bullfighter
This better be good
Oh Christ...
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Fuck you
It doesn't have to be
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
It's 350 pages long.
It's good, huh?
I want you back
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
You're lying to me.
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Oh, no--
They wanna talk to you.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
How do you know? You know her that good?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
See? That's all there was to it.
How's that?
What do you mean, "you"?
Three more, I figure.
You don't talk very much.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Jake...
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Now take the rest off.
What'd you see?
Why don't you just call him up?
Sure, what else is new?
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
How's the weight? Ok?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
No, you're his wife.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is Doyle's house.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
If possible -- both.
I can't do that.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Where?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Read some good books.
Like what?
Hello.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
That's abnormal.
You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
We've progressed emotionally in --
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Isn't he a salesman?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
What about this morning? Any developments?
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Ten here.
Goodnight, you idiot.
And your stomach?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Something big going on somewhere?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
So do I.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What do you think?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
What is it you're looking for?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
I wonder where he's going now?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
I have the whole weekend off.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Well?
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Buzz Gundersen.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
You can't protect me.
Mother--
You thought I was Mom?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
You're absolutely right!
Excuse us a minute?
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Hi.
You remember me?
How'd you get here?
Jim!
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
We'll take it!
Plato?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
No--I was just--maybe--
I'm getting that way, too.
You can trust me, Judy.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
She's being called for.
You can't find... what?
Toys for... adults?
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Where the hell are you going?
Ashley, Jesus --
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You forget where I work?
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
You motherfucker.
He'll kill you.
Nick, please, it's me --
I thought we'd have a few more days.
So does it look a lot different?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You... you don't know me --
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Be more specific.
You knew the place --
Hey, it's... been two years --
What the fuck are you talking about.
So what the hell good are you...
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
No gun.
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Cancer-sucker.
That motherfucker --
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Tell Ashley... I...
That was my king!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, did ya see that?
We can work this out, can't we?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
A little.
Didja use the commode story?
I can do that.
Jesus Christ!
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
As opposed to good?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
I got the diamonds.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
So, is he dead or what?
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
You don't know how good it is to see you.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
Like what?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
Don't you trust me?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Where you going?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I can't --
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
Where'd they go?
Oh... that's the time you went away.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
We might as well start a fire.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
We got to get movin'.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Would you like to learn them?
Good night, Miss Wells.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Are you okay?
I found a picture of his wife.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Maybe we can study together or something.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Let her go, Cin.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Hanson, please.
Stop! --
What the hell are you doing?
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Are you?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I got it!
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Got a problem with that?
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Professor!
What the hell?!
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I'm so glad you're here.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Did you hear?
0h, shit!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
CHIP!!
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
You got your wish.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
When I wanted to.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
I haven't got that much in cash.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
Redi's all right.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What were you talking about?
And that was all?
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her - something you never get hold of - something that keeps a man following after her.
At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Do you think he knows about this?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
You'll be all right?
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
My window - - through which I see the world.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you're offering me --I am being allowed to join -- to buy safety by betraying Jacqueline -- is that it?
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
But he also wrote --
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
This food is excellent.
Would you mind?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
Why is that?
You're what?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Donna?
No.
About sex?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
You know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
No.
So you do fantasize?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
And you feel the same way with John?
You're really never going to make love again?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Come on!!
Why are you ashamed?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Goddam right.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
What?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
No, it's nothing like that.
I don't want to talk about it.
He just asked me questions.
Thank you.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
The extrovert.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
You just want to ask me questions?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
And you ask questions, right?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
Not today. I've got other plans.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Why not?
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Mr. Millaney?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Jesus!
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Medical clinic?
Anything wrong?
Can I call you at the office?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
What happened?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
I don't get it.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
When do I get to see Brad?
SPONSOR!!!
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
Oh my poor baby.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
. . .For his own good.
Brad!
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
Our field.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Glass or bottle?
You okay, Miles?
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Is it chicken?
Two years ago, buddy.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
How old's she going to be?
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Yeah. Tight.
Sure I know Maya.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
What'd Christine say?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Do you like them?
Let me use your phone.
Well?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
We gotta go back.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
She got anything good?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Is she sleeping or...?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Maya.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, Maya. No.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Ken.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Huh.
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
There's dust in it.
Explain noises.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
Do you feel comforted?
Where are you going?
This is going to do nothing.
Merrill!
How do they know it's over?
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
I don't think so.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
Who?
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Where's your brother?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
The jury saw it differently.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What's stopping you?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
What about his brother?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Where's the dog now?
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
The picture's dead.
Where is she?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
... Simone.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
No, I'm okay.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
You know, I... don't know.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Good-night, Daddy.
Why didn't she thank you?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
About you and mom?
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Nice boat, Taransky.
I know what you're up to.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
You did create me.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
I forgot your name.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Why?
What'd you write?
What kind of words?
That isn't magic.
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
How often do you see them?
...No.
Dr. Crowe?
You really look better.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You know that accident up there?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
She wanted me to tell you--
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
I don't know how else to look--
Stuttering--
...He doesn't get invited places.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Bitch.
Bitch.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
"Peggy-Sue" --
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
What about Jeremiah?
What's wrong?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
What are --
Suzie... No.
No --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Like your guitar break.
-- Where have you two been?
Where's Mac?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
How about Brenda?
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
No reception out here.
What?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Who's the lucky fella?
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
I'll get if for you.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Why? You have a bowling date?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
Anything?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
By stealing my car?
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
What can I say?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Also boring.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
-- How we doing?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Bandit two, you read me?
Five thou.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Who?
I've got concerns.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
Here. Sit.   Please.
My debrief --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...When did you know all this?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
I'm working on it.
That takes some of the sting out.
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
Why?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I want to hear your version.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
You murdered her!
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
Is there anybody else here?
How long can you go without sleep?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
What do you want?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Jesus...
Don't.
You go home.
Why did you say those things?
Who have you been talking to?
Was she right?
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
No.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
How can you be here...
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
It's terrific Win.
Straight ahead.
I'm supposed to call in.
You live in Manhattan?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Let's get a drink.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Yeah.
No dog.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Yeah.
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
You don't want to know.
So.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Did you hear what I said?
What was that?
What did you do tonight?
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Ellie...
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Are you in charge here?
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
How are things going, pal?
How about dinner tonight?
You coming in?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Peter-- you took this picture?
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Flash, get lost.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Now tell me you love me.
Are you okay?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Yeah--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Would you cool it already?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
You're making my life difficult.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Toxic dumps, huh.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Yeah, Roz.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Absolutely no class.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
Private property, bub.
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Break it off!
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Jawohl.
Let me go! Let me go!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Equipoise! Equipoise! What did I tell you, Animal?
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Betty! Betty!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Anybody call?
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Go on.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
I'll make it five hundred!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Is it all right if we smell it?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Target their Bridge.
Captain=8A
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
This is its current position.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Population?
Is she still angry?
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Antonia?
Close to retirement?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Yes.  Thank you.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Aye.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Status!
Tractor beam, aye!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Aye sir, coding now.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Could it be Spock's?
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Did your collaborator know?
This planet is aging in surges.
I don't understand.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Yours...?!
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
What I have done, I had to do.
I ordered no interruptions.
Sir, may I --
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
I still don't under --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
David. Please.
Don't tell me you've got something.
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Well done, Commander.
He's on a build up to detonation!
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
She's not responding...
On screen.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
And who is this?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Not enough against their shields.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Kirk here.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Reliant's command...
On screen...
Admiral?
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Time!
Admiral on the bridge!
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Prepare for warp speed.
Fire all phasers...!
Certainly...
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I would accept that as an axiom.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Now wait just a damn minute.
That's crazy!
Oh, joy.
An experimental device, doctor.
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Can you isolate the wave?
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
"Neutralized?" How?
So you were at Berkeley.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
Do you trust me?
How will that be done, exactly?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
What's that?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Steady, now. We need your help.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
Spock...?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
Spock: Condition report!
Aye, sir. Descending.
Three-one-zero, aye!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The whales...?!
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
You have warp capability?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
There are days.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Why not...?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Incomplete, I might add.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
You're not going to launch anything until...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
You're not finished here?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
I don't think they believe us.
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
Who is it?
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Initiate launch sequence.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You think they're still up there?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Ready to make a little history?
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Main bus...
Where in the States?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Did you need something?
What?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Why?
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
No!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Shields. Battle stations.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
An accident wasn't good enough...
Your friends are late...
What took you so long?
Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That's an order.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Surely not.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Are you dining on worms?
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Her own father...?
Any progress?
A lie?
Direct hit -
Trouble?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Why?
Why?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Remember him?
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
How long does he have?
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Yes, sir.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Why?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Yes.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
You're not here.
What's he doing?
Deanna, on my mark.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
I won't do it.
No!
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Strength in numbers?
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
All of this so you could capture me?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Yes.
That's your life... not mine.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Report!
Are we prepared?
And?
Benny, there's nothing there.
What did I tell you?
What can I do for you folks?
What do you think of America?
Where's that?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Mrs. Haydn...
Please...
Ah... no...
Steering wheel.
Which way?
No gas.
Go.
I am husband?
I want to try it.
Horses.
Why are you going here? What is here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
Yes.
The driver will...
Yes.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Yes.
Where are you going?
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
What will you say about us?
This is yours...
How long will it take you to get home?
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
You sure this is your car?
They after you?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Hello...
We can't let you do that.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
I made my choice, Lenny.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
He has his uses too.
Who did it?
That's not sayin' much.
You should feel like shit.
You alright?  Y'okay?
So've I.  Too much.
Top ten.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
So there never was a death squad.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Are we having a bad night?
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
No more, Lenny.
Whatup Lenny?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
It was a tough call.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Mace... you're a girl.
Are we under arrest?
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Besides that.
Testa?
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
You... surprised me.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
I think I talked to him.
Its called insubordination.
How do you feel, Agent
Do you think he singled you out?
I'm hesitant to...
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
There was talk of a file photo.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
You work with Koessler?
Doesn't fit.
Yes I do.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Suspect Zero?
So you went underground?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
...not until you book it...
You haven't told then, huh?
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
The poor thing. Six years?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Me too.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
...Which one...?
I miss you, Mike.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
There's the rub.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
An eight.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Oh, like that song...
Him?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
That's right.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Wake up, baby.
They're all skanks.
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
Always.
...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
That's bullshit.
I know. I know.
Baby, you did fine.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
...So give me the fuckin part...
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Selling scrap metal.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
What are you doing?
What the fuck..?
Because he's a bitch.
Is she looking at me, baby?
It's on.
...we're not...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
No.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
But you needed a drink first.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
What was this for?
What miracles you do for strangers.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Give them some money and send them home.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
What was that?
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
I'm German-Irish.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
What time do they expect us?
Michael...
He'll be OK.
Tell me!
Send some bodyguards.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Do you renounce Satan.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
I think so.  Detective squad?
How do you do.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Hi Tom.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Shut up.
You know, a primer.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I'm never going back!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I've got plans!
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Who is it?
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
You should watch that!
Hardly.
Yes it is.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Hello Marge.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
He hates being confronted.
Oh my God. Tom.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
You've got Dickie's rings.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
What?
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
You're kidding.
Ditto.
And tomorrow?
We'll be there.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Do you want me to stick around?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Why lie?
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I really don't want to see anybody.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
How much for everything.
How much to get a permit to carry?
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Well, we're all working tonight.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Really?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Damn.
Well... mostly...
Travis?
He's Black, OK?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I'm serious, really...
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
20 bucks?
I don't remember.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Well, you want to or not?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
Why not?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
No.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
So whatja do now?
No, I want long shifts.
Who?
Anything you say, officer.
So howsit?
What's the action around?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Not really.
Limp dick?
You knew?  All this time?
God's speed.
Hi.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
I do?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Were we going to get married?
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Your dancing's very good.
I see...
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
No.  But...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Why?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Jesus...
I'm here.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
That was beautiful.
Sit.  Play with me.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
Ancestors?
They all know you?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Yes, I did.
Mother!
Do you know him?
Where does he live?
It's a surprise, you see.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
You did say birds?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
They won't be.
Then he saw.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Doesn't what make me...?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
I didn't break that window!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What's that?
You like me, huh?
Yes, but...
What?
Without any clothes on?
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
But you tore it up.
I do different things on different days.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
How long have they been gathering there?
What time is it?
We'd better light some of those lamps.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Scotch, light on the water.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
He's not home.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Well --
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
This is not a woman!
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
But what makes a thought start?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
What did they give you?
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
How about sign of a big black bird?
Just don't believe everything you see.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
You killed her!
Please. Come inside.
You wrote this?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Such power exists?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
No foolin'? Will you?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
Oh -- hello--
Just twelve.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
Why not?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
All together?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
I can't beat a Triumph.
What is this, David?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
David.
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
... And stay outta here.
Good!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Lights out, Sam.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Hi...
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
What happened, Michael!?
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Where these tracks headed?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
You catch anything he was saying?
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
We should have jumped his ass.
Neither will we.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
Put that down!
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
What kind of test?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Maybe it ain't coming.
What's happened?!
Ah... no.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
What's your name?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
We make them see what we wish.
Why?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
And why not?
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Dance with me...
Admiration?  My my.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
My God...
We took a walk three days ago.
In the future, we'll be better.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
You wouldn't believe me.
This... was my home.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Is there a lot of illness?
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
That machine --
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Is he all right?
And this is your "work"?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
He said he traveled for two months.
You won't even try?
Yes, sir.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
We'll see about that.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
He's recovering on the third floor.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
I don't understand...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
This is really happening, isn't it?
I need to get this letter to someone.
What're those?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
You're sure?
They're not here.
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
How?
And if I didn't want to come?
You were convicted of the crime.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
You don't understand.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Of course you don't know.
Well, how'd you get here?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
You don't think that's crazy?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
How?
Hon.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Honey?
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Who do you think did it?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Alright.
That's certainly possible.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
So how come you don't have any kids?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Where'd y'all go?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Is this your car?
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Oh my God.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
But you think he fools around.
Call him?
Will I be?
What's wrong with you?
Now what?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
What little dogs?
What?!  What about him?!
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Thelma, that is not an option.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Are you going to apologize or not?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
I don't know about this, Dom.
His mother?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Stalker, huh?
Very nice.
The sawbones?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
By the way, what's your name?
How'd you know that?
Are you... an architect?
I work with retards.
A surprise?
All set.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Jai alai?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
You what?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
You little fuck.
Thanks for picking me up.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Oh. Well I am.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Are you all right?
You look great.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
What what are you doing here?
But but what about Steve?
Yeah? What do you want?
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Ho there.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Well, there's only one thing to do.
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
My father --
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
And?
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Should be here any minute.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
This is a restricted area.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What are you --
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
What was he saying?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
That's not solid.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
It's not real.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
This Clear Moon's house?
Who did?
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Do you want a coffee?
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Two.
What would?
I can't.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Does it bother you?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
And now I want you.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Goose is dead.
What does it mean?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Well?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Tomcats?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Is there something I should know?
Is it you?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Tom Kazansky.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
It's a victory roll.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
You didn't help.
He's a good pilot.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
I can take care of myself.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Need a ride?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
So, been married long?
I'm listening.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You open it.
HER!
I don't know.
They found us!  Everybody out!
Where?
Look at this shit.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Lori...
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
What are you doing?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
--I got a trip to Mars.
The hell you're not.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Clever girl.
Right.  Mars.
I'm not interested in that.
I love you.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
I'm not falling for it.
Now what?
What reactor?!
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
You didn't cook breakfast?
You're gonna get us hung up.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
Somebody paying you to do this?
The con...!  Oh my God.
And I appreciate it.
Think it's still following us?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Gimme back my bottle.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
Come now. Did you see the gun?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
-- an angel dust dealer --
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Ten years is a long time.
-- Easy as that, huh?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
-- What?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
I embellished.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
-- About what?
...I'm dying out there.
'lo, Cecil.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
The stuff we got last night.
We can do it right here.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Well, where are you going?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
You try that you little monkey.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
HE'S GONE.
No.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Take a look at this.
Are you going to see James tonight?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Where are the Cookies?
What are you doing?
The pages are gone. That's real.
Did you make me a tape?
Right on time, baby.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
What about tonight?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
Good night, Mom.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Are you sure you're okay?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland...
What's wrong?
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
You're right. There's no one here.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
He was accused of jury tampering.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Just now...
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I did.
Objection!
Thank you. When Debby...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Dr. Thompson...?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Yes.
I'm sorry...?
Thank you...
Yes.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Are you done?
I object, your Honor...
Exception!
I changed my life today. What did you do?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Mr. Galvin's...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Dr. Gruber.
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
It's a long road that has no turning.
I have to talk to you.
Who have we got?
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
They've all stopped at the same time.
Is that... machine...?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
What's up?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Yes.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
DO you mind...
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Time for sleep.
He's on his way.
And...what's the man doing?
Home.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
When do you think it'll be done?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Freddy, for all I know.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
You got it.  What's happening?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
Then what is he doing?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Me?  Why me?
Can I get you something to drink?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
She isn't that old.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Why then.
Hey, shut up will ya?
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
Yes, sir.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
Don't ever call me stupid.
What?  Come on...
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
Well, that was neighborly.
But, they don't speak English.
What are you blubbering about?
No.
I can't be sure.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
No.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
What is it?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
You hitched yet?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
In what capacity?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
You won't of missed much.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Sailor!
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
What's that, peanut?
You got me, peanut.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
You ready for this?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
And no AC.
Now what?
That you, Sail, honey?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Sailor? You know what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
How can you say that, Sailor?
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Course I am, mama.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Take care of him?
Just tell me what you want.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Put your shoulders back.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
You're stoned.
What's this guy's problem?
Sometimes we have to improvise.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
How bad is it for you?
So whose car is it?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Came to my senses.
Me? What can I do?
Is that in my chart?
She told you about...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Can I ask you something about her?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Thank you.
He didn't give his name.
Yes.
But... ?
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Kinship. And what's here?
What?
It's warm.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Near Carvel?
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Thanks for that. He all right?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
But where? I need the street.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
New?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
I'm through improvising.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
And?
Where's Emily, Hank?
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Cherry.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Then what? What?!
C'mon, Walter.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
You always carry these?
See anything interesting?
Too much sun.
You walked home.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
People have the right to know.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
You seem a little hostile today.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Why do you think you're here?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
When did it all start?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
No, I am not going to --
Where are you?
Don't ever do that again.
I'm only asking questions.
Very weird.
Are you?
Doesn't it get noisy?
Something happened to you.
So?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, there.
I never hurt them. Never.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
I'm sorry, Walter.
I've changed.
Being here, with me.
I've got problems.
Thank you.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
I'm taking you back out.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
You never did like being called that, did you?
What happened?
No.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Try again.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Son of a bitch!
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Virgil?
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Cab One, radiation readings?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
Hey!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
Would we see the flash?
A little more so this time.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Well?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Are you feeling better?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Oh, Sandro...
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
Do you consider that a compliment?
I'm not coming.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Giulia...
Yes, sir. Three times.
What other boat?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Thank you.
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Let's talk about something else.
Well, who in particular?
Often?
Where do you meet?
No. I was sick.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
Why should I?
What else did she tell you?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
Agnes...
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
What the child?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She's dead isn't she?
Yes?
Why?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you intelligent?
And why am I here?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Would you like to tell me?
Hm hmm.
Who?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Him.
Not your fault...
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
That's absurd!
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Shortly after she came to us.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Like keeping her home from school?
Listening to angels?
She molested her!
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
We'll see about that.
Bullshit yourself!
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Pipe!
She's been touched by God, yes.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But how did it happen?
That's what I have to believe...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
Eight and two thirds.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Oh, it's all right.
What about all these letters?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Me? Why?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Grotty?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Sure. .
What's up?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
I don't think that bit's right.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Thank you.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Yes.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
A book!
What are you doing?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Clean though, isn't he?
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Gie's a kiss!
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
What's old got to do with it?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Is it?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
You're a window rattler, son.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Down the ... er ...
Eh, what's all this?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Are you in pain?
Gravity?
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
I have recorded the transmission.
Computer, what language was that?
Just <u>hold it</u>, <u>hold it</u>!  Computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
Yes!
Yes?  What is it?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Dead!
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
It's clear.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
It will be.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
Oh no.
This should do it.
What's the frequency?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
Receiving.
It's close, real close.
<u>What is it</u>?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
They're getting pretty close now.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
We do know that.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Would somebody fill me in?
Engaged.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Let's hear it.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Better?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
How many of them are there?
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Listen to what?
But I'm going first...
Still got him?
Hold it, hold it...
Is this the suit?
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
Okay, we're in business.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
I've found Ackland!
Where'd you leave them?
How's it going?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
How do you know my name?
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
I didn't mean just the Theater.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
You sat and talked until it was light...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
Bill...
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Happy little housewife...
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
Yes, dear.
With the paper to prove it.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
So few come back...
What have I got to do with it?
Don't run away, Bill.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Lemme fix you a drink.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
An answer.
Why not?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
Not at all.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Oh, but there is-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
She's just outside the door.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
Lloyd, what happened...?
What time is it?
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
What's so funny?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
I'm sure.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
I never said it was!
Yes, sir.
Call, what call?
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
"Liebestraum."
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Anything to help you out, Max.
July of '71.
--I'm trying--
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
'68.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
Goddamnit--
--we gotta top the Times--
I think that's him.
What's the matter?
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
What does it say?
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Sure--off the record.
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Right.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
What's this?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
There were more then.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
That was awhile ago.
Go on.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
What?!
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
That's not why we're going out.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
No comment.
There's our man.
That's stupid.
Dad!  I know!
Yes dad.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Dad.
Okay, I get it.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
You can do that?
So you need to change, right?
Shame on you!
Jim...
Tonight?
Vicky, wait.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Now?!
You sure you're comfortable?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
What?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Okay, explain.
...Guess what?
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Merde! Just missed!
Salots! Shitfucker!
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Hello?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Holy mother of God...
What does it say?
Okay. Be careful.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
You recognize her?
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Not you too -
Uncle Terrence?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
What do you mean, maniacs?
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Now!
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Is everyone all right?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Did I tell you that?
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Come on up!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Don't let me go!
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Why does everyone have to act that way?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
What do we do now?
So where will you go?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
She does.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Perhaps you could convince her?
Hey, you on television?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Singer!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
You're like New York. You're an island.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
So sorry.
Oh - you're an actress.
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Sylvia Plath.
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
what I mean?
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
it's my first time.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Okay?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Look at these guys.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Really?
Oh, you have my body.
M'hm.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
You're so sure about it.
You followed me!
M'hm.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Okay, let me have this.
Yeah?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Here's a real present.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
God.
God.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
What'd I do?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Sixteen years ago.
Mean?
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Ah.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Well, sit down.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh. What about?
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Isn't Skye amazing?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
Honey?
Oh.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
You should have brought him.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
He's gonna miss his flight.
It's not a contest.
I'm the hired help.
Escape hatch.
The suspense is killing me.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
We've heard lots about you.
We closed.
Take your time, Jer.
You want me to uninvite her?
In the kitchen.
Truce.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Panes!  How are you?
Has she called?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
You lose this?
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Something soft.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
I need to leave you now.
I've never done this before.
Lemon or raspberry?
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Of course it's alright.
I didn't say a word.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I was impressed.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Shit!
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Um.  Happy for you.
We're going to have to go back out there.
She's such a great photographer.
What do you mean, thank God?
Are you asking me out to dinner?
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
And you are...?
You dance...
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
What <u>was</u> that thing?
We're going to die!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Bala!
You new, kid?
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
Ask me why we're so successful.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
So this is your mother's apartment?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Say, you got a lulu.
Oh, I never catch colds.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I forgive you.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
You all right? What's the matter?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Who?
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
Do I have to?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
I mean, after that?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
I'm not through with you yet.
How would you like to go tonight?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Don't mind what?
Now you're being bright?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Want to tell me what happened?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
How's the patient?
What's this -- you packing?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
You got a girl-friend?
Say, this is Snugsville.
Not so rough, honey.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Doctor.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
What !
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Moonby what?
Sometimes.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Why they call you that?
And the grass?
Charlie?
Who's he?
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Can I go get those mangos now?
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Well, get in there.
Get in there !
What the hell is it?
They're not Cong.
I --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
How did they know?
Yeah.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Good swell.
You smell that.  You smell that?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Why did you come to ... my province.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
Go away -- hide yourself.
The other one --
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
What will you do after the war?
Are you warm, Captain?
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
20   CONTINUED:  
117  CONTINUED:  
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
215  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
39   CONTINUED:
My dad was a Navy doctor.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Be careful, okay?
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Does he have people?
Been driving long?
Stay put!
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
How long has he been having problems?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Oh, please...
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
The stiff one eye?
Hey -- you let him...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
How to die, mostly.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
How's Verdell doing?
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
Oh, is he dead?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
I told you to go on in.
Because...  ... you love her?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Why?  What happened?
No shit.
Yeah.
Probably.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
What?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Really?
What?
I don't believe that.
They're worth less points.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
That's a ridiculous move.
What happened to her?
Were you attracted to me right away?
That doesn't sound normal.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Then, I'll sail alone.
I think I've heard of you.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
What are you thinking about?
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
Oh yeah, what's that?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
There shooting at something.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
She's tired.
If you get out can we be together again.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
They'll do it.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
So, he didn't fire you?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Josh!
Will you come home and forget all about him?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
Out with Belinda?
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I told him to leave me alone.
Now it's okay?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
Landon!
This play -- ?
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Saturn. Beautiful.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Yeah.
Oh. Just not at school...
You were great the other night.
She great or what?
What do you actually know with religion?
Come on.
Are you trying to seduce me?
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
It's gone now.
But if you could, you would?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
You're marrying again.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
This is 1952....?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Hi, Marty.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Oh yeah.
No, Chinese food is fine.
The sunrise? What for?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Huh?
'Bike fine point?'
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
And where am I gonna be?
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
You didn't?
Obviously!  
How you doing, Cato?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Doing what?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Nothing.
Quit my job.
What a nice place.
My stomach's growling.
You know what I think?
Are you sure?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
You okay?
You're a welcome sight...
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
He offered you money?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
...Hello.
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
A souse!
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Howdy, neighbor.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
...This must be boring you.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
How did you know about that?
Barton. Are you all right?
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
...Yes, thank you.
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Fink.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
...Okay
...Those your only bags?
Is this multiple choice?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
Yeah, I was drinking.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Take care, you hear?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How about the booze?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
Were you with him last night?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
How did you feel when he died?
Even though you were fucking him.
I passed.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Yes.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Nope, can't say that I do.
How'd it go, son?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
Why not?
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Where the hell you goin'?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Keep your three o'clock.
Fuck you, Phil.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
What do you think?
Of what?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Cool.
Ouch..
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Piss painting?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
No.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
I'm not black.
Would you like to see the wine list?
You want me to put it here?
Who's that?
Your people.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
I don't really have any problems.
She's good.
Guess I just got sick of him.
I thought you hated this place?
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
What's wrong with me?
That is amazing. What year is it?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
So shut up and keep painting..
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Admiring your handiwork?
I'm listed.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Uncle Alfred?
I love you, old man.
It's good to see you.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
And?
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Who's Ivy?
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
What say we turn up the heat?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
...Afraid.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Up here, Al.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
To kill me.
But...
Fast work. You just moved here.
He sure did.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Find anything interesting?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Why do you do that?
I don't-.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Chase?
No.  Wait...
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
A hit.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
GET IN THE CAR!!
I'll have to ask you for that film.
... How long have I been out?
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Do you sail?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
Keep her on the line!
We got 'em!
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
... Why the mask?
You are on drugs.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Hi,
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Big day today, huh? 78
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Say that again, son.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
David, David, David ...
Welsh again.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Well, there is that ...
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Shut up, dill-hole.
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Talk ta me, Bork.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Really? That's where we're from.
You got two seconds!
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
What about this Beetle guy?
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
And your sushi was remarkable.
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Handbook?  When...?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Three syllables.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
God, you're anatomically correct!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Just don't tell Lydia.
Where is your mother?
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
What's wrong?
Is there much more of this torture?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... And please call me Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
I would like to watch television.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
What is that?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
To watch...? To watch me...?
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Can you see well?
I feel very good in here.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
How long do we stay in here?
... That is a very small room.
Yes. I've seen that done.
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Since you were a child?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Good morning, Mr. President.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
... Would you take me on a tour?
... What do you make of all this?
... Yeah...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
What?
Which one is Elijah again?
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
Why?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
We?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
My God!
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
I've fallen in love.
Lotte? Is that you?
Let him try.
Hello, Don.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No.
No. Don't be an ass.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
When?
Is there dancing?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Stay in him forever?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Yeah what?!
You saying nothing counts?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WILL YOU STAY?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
I want somethin' sweet.
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Well, if you want my opinion...
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
No. I mean work work.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
I know what I see.
Can't locate him.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Jesus.
No, You looking good.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Fuckin' A.
Yeah.
I am the Walrus.
They posted the next round of the tournament--
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
It's already posted.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
What do you need that for, Dude?
I've had a--
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Oh yeah?
That's really thoughtful but I--
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well yeah...I know that.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Oh shit.  Walter.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Huh?
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
This driveway.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Yeah.
Dude.
Well?  Aren't you?
Bullshit. Walter!
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
How do you feel?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
So you're going to do this?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Going on twenty years now.
What took you so long?
Don't try to talk --
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
What are you looking at?
Graffiti --
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Is he sick?
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
You don't have to be.
This isn't human blood.
That's weird --
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Inside the grave?
No!
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
So says her website.
--now c'mon!
Was that you laughing?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
There, what? I didn't see anything.
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
We should be so lucky.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Fire escape??
She would've had to have a key, anyway, to lock the deadbolt behind her.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
Nobody's going anywhere--
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
Hold this.
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
What--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
She got <u>paid</u>.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What?
You gonna be alright?
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
What the fuck's going on here?
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
On the phone. Was it for you?
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Well I'll be damned.
...Ray?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
...So what're you doing tonight?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Sure don't.
...You know that car?
What "what"?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...There's a big--
...it's too damn risky.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
...Why?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Why do you do it?
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Is Sandy part of this?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Hello, baby.
Hello, daddy.
Where are we going, Frank?
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
You can hit me, if you want to.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Come in.
What do you want to do?
You like to open me. don't you?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
You called me Jeffrey.
I'll call you.
I don't want to go.
What else is new?. right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Are you alright?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
What's the plan.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
You didn't tell him about me?
It's okay.
My father has a gun at home.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
Well. Okay.
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
On the plane.
Blanca, por favor.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
You wanna split?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
What did I tell you?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
You?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
But you must.  It's the only way.
Good to see you, Diego.
Please, continue.
I know.
Touche.
George, good to see you, my brother.
I'm calling it three.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
Who's the cheapskate?
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Freedom.
Yeah, maybe.
I know.
I know.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
George.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Hello.
Not in front of the kid.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
I don't know.
What are you doing here?
What do you want from me?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
California, huh?
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Because she's visiting me.
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Yeah?
It's not enough.
Smith.  Hampshire....
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Second name.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Where's Kader?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
How you doin' Mister D?
About three hours.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
No questions.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
I've got work to do.
What about Miss Lawson?
She was here?
Why not?
Why do you think she left you?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Yes.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
What happened next?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Do you think I did it?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Something like that.
Can we get out of here?
That's not an answer.
Nothing.
Hello?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Why would she lie?
Can I see you later?
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
I love you.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Is that alright, Frank?
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Albert's got the stomach flu.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Well, I can help.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't say that!
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Well, I'd like to read them.
Then why do you?
I bet mom could've helped her.
Not yet. You want to go?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Oh, that's nice.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
He's very... clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
And did you?
Do you miss it?
Smells like dirt.
You really don't need anyone?
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Can I help?
But you don't mind.
Uh-huh. And?
Am I too heavy for you?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
I don't know. Please...
You feeling better Franny?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
Oh my God...!
It clearly states in the will --
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Hell no!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
Are you nuts?
'S up?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
We can climb out.
That's what?
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Cinn?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Jimmy Bones?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
You shouldn't have hit me.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
The money!
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They just left, didn't they?
You can't leave.
I need you ...
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
But everybody is all right.
Now that's teamwork.
Not on duty, sorry.
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
This is a beautiful place.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Do you know him?
No.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Why?
That's his brother.
Any bodyguards?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
He'll have to run.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Oh, God.
I know you will.
And what if I couldn't do that?
Treadstone?
I think so.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
So what's in Paris?
I said ten thousand.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
I needed a break.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
You knew he was coming.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
xxxxxx.
Stop where you are.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
What?
What if it doesn't come back?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
...ergency procedures.
... fix themselves.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
...ven't you?
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Go away.
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Jack!!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... no.
Out of kindness.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
And you're mine.
They weren't at school with us.
Say it was a mistake.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
You stupid bastard!
Who are you? Let go!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Why not?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Turn!
Shit! The house is on fire!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Don't you like parties?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What do you think? ... is it me?
But if they did promote you
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Lime, I need to use your computer
My mother said it would be all right.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Mother? Is that you?
Uh ...
Whatever happened to you?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
But we can get one.
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
Ha!!
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
The pace?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
Frank Pierce.
Okay, what happened?
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Is he going to be alright?
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Promise you won't go inside.
This is not a good time.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Who's that?
I'll drink to that.
He got better.
He one of them?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Where's Burke?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Let's get in a fight, then.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
You're in the stomach!
Shit, shit, shit...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
No.  No.
What did they do with you?
Okay.
It's nice to see you.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Which would you prefer?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
Yes.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Yes.
Do you feel good about it?
Aaron, will you tell me?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I think you're the Devil.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Just a few questions?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Yes.  That's right.
I really have to go.
Yes.  How do you know?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Anchor?
I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
Bye, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
I've got another story.
Jane?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
So what did you think?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Hi.  It's me.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
Hello?
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Take it easy.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Walter can I ask you something?
Alright we're clear.
What's it called?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Look at the size of it!
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Oh yeah?
More champagne, your majesty?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
It was.
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Yeah.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Well...why murdered man?
A show..how soon can we go?
What do you have in the box?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
You're gonna shoot me!
Well, I'll go home with you.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice to feel needed.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
No, we didn't.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Wheels?
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Something like that.
No, you didn't.  When?
You want some water or something?
They were vampires, weren't they?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Things are kind of confusing.
Hey, Buffy...
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I crashed your party.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I was a slave.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Oh.  Sorry.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Come one, that was so weird.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Pike.
So very much.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
The mark of the Coven.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Okay, let's go.
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
Cool!
Oh, yeah!
Buffy, the ape-woman.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You said "Crash".
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
How ya like that?
Just till I lose.
How 'bout a back rub?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
It's Skip, for you.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Crash...I want you.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And now you wanta teach me?
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
Will that work for me?
Don't bump me.
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
How come you don't like me?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Step outside, pal.
No way.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
What'you want, kid?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You were wandering around.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
He even played golf with the President.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Okay.
She's not here, Sam.
I'll call you right back.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Yeah.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Hey, Ace.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You lost your control.
Yes, you lost your control.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
...hundred yards further down the road.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Sam, we got a problem.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Why're you crying?
You sure?
Oh, fabulous.
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
I bought him a watch too.
Get off of me! Stop it!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
The arrangement is over!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
You threw it away?
I put her to bed.
Oscar wants you to call him.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
Why do you want to do that?
Just wait there for me!
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Loose machines are right back over there.
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
No.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Yes.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
Can I go in?
All right. Okay, okay.
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Sure.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
What? What?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm always here for you.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
I just talked to him.
There's more!
Ace saw Vegas one way.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
This is Nick.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Don't know.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Tony.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
There's a lot of people here.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yes, uh...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
I better go report this in...
I've been looking for you.
God, can you hear me!
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Pass!
What's the catch?
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
I'm a good mother!
Hey, you're anti-male.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
You seem sad, Spooky.
Nice breasts.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
What's this?
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Nels?
Any minute.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Where'd they take you to?
What makes you say that?
Who?
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
"Theo?"
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Hey drop it, okay?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Why tell me this?
Did you jiggle the phone?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes sir.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
What's happening?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
They did some great job of reforming you.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
I'm handling it.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
You're making it too easy.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
And then?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Just cut his hair, you know.
Saw that one.
He agreed that he was.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Good thing in a man.
Maybe he wants something.
You fucking promised.
Take your clothes.
No.
Everybody wants something.
Hi.
What was that?
Perform?
You on the game?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Piss off, Dave!
He lived here with you?
No.
Do I?
What does that mean?
So I'm sorry.
Do they know?
Kind of wish I didn't.
There's Dave. He knew too.
What?
Come on.
You do something for me, Dil?
You'd do anything for me?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
So tell me.
Good-bye, Dil
Died...
Tell me you love me.
What's Fergus?
She was --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
So what do you need, Fergus?
You don't know that.
Eddie and Tinker died.
Leave her out of this.
Of course. I forgot.
Perfect.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
What?
You sure about that?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Fuck you.
Thank you, handsome.
What's that?
Hey --
They won't let him die.
I'm not a gambling man.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Fergus?
See? I was right about you.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Help me.
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
Don't run off, Jude.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
And you know what?
All right -- where's the letter?
What are you talking about?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
No.
But you're -- divorced?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Why can't you be serious?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
I think Tex did it.
Yes, I know.
Got you.
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
About how wealthy would you say?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Yes, but we're divorced.
Where did everything go?
What's going on?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Go on.
Yes -- that's right.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Do you know him?
What is it about?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
I get all your CDs.
Hi Jody.
You're grounded Friday night!
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Hi honey.
You know her?
Should we close down any eruption?
What happened?
St. Michael's.
She was murdered?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
You aren't going to the party?
Then you should go.
Not that many.
Someone tried to kill me.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
This place is empty.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I heard you got attacked.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Lisa Sherman?
Unfair?!
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
 Oh...
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Since when does...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
He could've called first.
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Huh?
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Come on, get in the truck.
It happens to this piece of shit...
...town. 
No, no, no.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
...I'm not the psycho.
...I believe in live and...
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
Oh, shit.
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Whoo!
I made it!
Shut up!
Hang on!
 Okay.  Okay. 
Oh, shit!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
A-And you  owe me...
Hey, just shut up.
Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!
Oh.
Okay. 
Okay, here we go.
...-natic.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
...face" crap you've been telling me?
...us.
Oh!
I was undercover as a tennis player.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
Hey.
I urge you to be persuasive.
But...
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Listen, deputy.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
They were all wearing hardware.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...about--
...always done, Richard?
And let me guess.  You failed.
This is it.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
There.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Is this your establishment?
Assumptions are always...
Not tonight...
I want you to look at one another...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...it.
And don't give him any ice cream...
 Two pots of coffee...
Oh, no?
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...somehow. 
It's after five...
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Great.  All right...
Thanks. 
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Dr.  Long!
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Okay, doc.
Get in 
Gimme this god-...
 Talk to me.
Arlo.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
Is she all right?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Sure thing.
I'll throw that in too.
That's a filthy habit.
I'm not.
That's just lovely.
How do they do that?
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
No.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
For very long?
How did it happen?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
You sure shout that?
That dam is a con job.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
We got it. We got it, baby.
As little as possible.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
I said I want the truth.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
On his day off. Get the exact address.
How do you know?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
The obituary column?
Yeah, Sophie.
Oh my goodness.
I'm sorry. We don't.
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
I don't understand.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Do you know me?
The water.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
That's a long fall.
Gittes?... Gittes?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
Of course not.
Then go home and forget about it.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Yeah?
Not exactly.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
How's school?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Emily!
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Emily, you -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
You're very easily amused.
A chicken?
A rooster?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
How old did you say you were?
Yes -
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Close the door, Raymond.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Yes and no.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
What's this?
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
You can hold me down.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
Train. It took eight hours.
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I just told you.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
How'd you get here so fast?
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Are you open?
Excuse me, do you have...
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
You don't want to know.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
What did he say?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
The milkmaids.
At least we're stuck here together.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Oh, my god.
His dick was in his mouth?
Let me borrow your car.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're kidding.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
Who eats cock?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
You still didn't have to choke me.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
You know him?
Go open the video store.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
You calling me a liar?
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
I said go ahead.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
What were you doing up so late?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
"Be there?"
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
You sucked his dick!
HOW MANY?
Hey! Where are you going?!
What is it?
You had to tell him.
What did he say?
Thank you for being rational.
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
What are you talking about?
What did he say?
I do about three-fifty, four.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
You hope what feels good?
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
Twenty bucks?
Did you catch that thunder?
Answer the man.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Go on, fetch.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
She's tough.
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Can you see light?
No luck?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Never, what?!
Thanks for holding on.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Just kidding.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
It's up there, on the Tower.
Travers, you're not running things.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Why didn't you send the money over?
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Do you still feel suicidal?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Well, who can blame them, sir?
What do I want?
I'm gonna be sick.
I wanna be sick.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Crime?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Something like that.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
But not now?
...he's two floors below you.
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
What?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Vincent?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
They said send you downstairs.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I never told her.
Are you crazy?!
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
You think I'm crazy.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Yes.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You okay?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Was that who I thought it was?
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Murdered?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
You will?
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
My father's house.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
What's that?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Excuse me?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
So, you doing anything tonight?
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Agent Lowry.
Do you believe me?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
Is it possible...?
Peter sends his regards.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it?  What's happened?
David --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Got a bogey, boss?
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
So who -- what -- are you?
Can you show me?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So we passed some kind of test?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
But the work --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Ellie -- are you okay?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
Spoken like a true believer.
How do you mean?
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
What?
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Yeah.
No.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
Borrowin' or payin' back?
So then you just call him.
But there's still daylight left.
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Man, it's so hot.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
You're fired.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
We'll get the paramedics...
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
When he was seventeen.
Who are you?
I never hurt nobody...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
The door was already open...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
It's a woman shot in a car?
He was in my apartment!
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I heard. Good police work.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
What's wrong with him?
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
There was no sperm.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Where you going?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
Where were you?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
Patient.
Do we have to talk about this?
What's all the dreck?
You're slowing.
What do you think?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
I gather he's late as usual.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
I'm only looking out for you.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
Letty, you should be in bed.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What if it's got a pattern?
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
Don't take it personally.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
For a price.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Furnished?
What are we going to do?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Forget I asked.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Where are the tapes?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Why are you here?
And?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
Tonight?
For what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Because you're the closest.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
I thought they came with batteries.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
They were all French guys.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
How about Canada?
You lived there. You know the city.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
You guys used to work together?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
J&amp;B?
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
You got it in a bar?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
What's this?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Okay.    Okay.
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Put them down.
No, really?
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Let's end this here.
Give it back!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
Then, why did you come?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Save your strength.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
But the sword could be in his compound.
You buying?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Thank you.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Oh really?
You've read The Fountainhead?
Shut up.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
That's also none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
What?
I do.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Outstanding.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
What was that?
That's great.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Why didn't you do something?
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
Excellent.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Why not?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Moving along quite well.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
You didn't?
No, tell me.
Get off me!
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
You're too kind.
I can't thank you enough.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
She's out.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Hey Ronald.
She was very pretty.
Oh, thank you, darling.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
You're shouting at me.
Ollie.
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
These are all from me.
Who are you?
Irena. But who are you?
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
But you must!
It's you...Irena...my friend!
But why?
It's a pretty ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
And does he kill people?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
What is it, ma'am?
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
How have you been feeling?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
I think she broke the skin.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Maybe they have to pee.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Oh no.
Get rid of him!
What happened to his tooth?
DON'T call the police.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
I'm cleaning my stove.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I do development for TV movies.
You're kidding, really?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
It's a matter of life and death.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
Wow.
Script coverage?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I really gotta get going.
No, why?
Is that how you feel?
What's with the squirt guns?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
How do you know?
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
You think mafia hit?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
What kind of animal?
Please, they'll kill me...
Why do you want to speak to him?
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
It seems fine.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Who is it?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
You see it?
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I didn't realise...
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I'm sorry.  About before.
You're a liar!
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
How do you know I'm innocent?
What's with her?
The Washington Post.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
... what?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Clean.
Uh, let me get back to you...
No!...  WE didn't anything...
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
What do you mean by that?
Are you threatening me?
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Gimme a quarter.
This is from the people of Burundi...
They re not my attack dogs.
Oh... Hi.
Yeah.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
What's that?
What are you staring at?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I really don't have much of an appetite.
Yes.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Well I guess...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
So this is it?
Please....shoot me.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
Then why did you come here?
His madness....could be from shock.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
What?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
TONY....TONY....
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Don't stop.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Pleased to meet you.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Yes sir.
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A yawp?
LOUDER!
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
I've found it.
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
Right here...middle of nowhere...
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
And no questions asked.
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Yeah you did...
Looking good...
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
What did you do the my kids!!
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
What the hell does that mean?
What was that?
Someone's back there.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
She fucked us both.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Damn right!
Ammo! Get the ammo!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
Let's go!!!
You don't!
That's new, isn't it?
He's real bad, Nick.
Sure. Why not.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You like to call me Linda now?
How was huntin'?
Holy shit!
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
You Biederman?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Linda, what's the matter?
Okay.
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
You're going hunting?
I'm just so lonely.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
You think we'll ever come back?
What are you, hoping?
Forget Sal.
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Yeah.
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Speak up.
I want to stop aging.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Sir, your limo's here.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Does it drive itself, too?
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Yeah.
Good night, Wade.
Hey, I'm eating.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Rip Van Winkle.
Sanchez...?
But he was such a good cop.
Seat's too high.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Jabez -- ?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
But I like the new one better.
Grandma, look at me!
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Loan shark -- hey?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Now run along, Daniel.
What's the matter with you?
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Coming along, Jabez?
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Dan'l Webster?
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
How much?
Down, Shep! Down!
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary -- it's gone.
I'll get the doctor.
Mary -- what would you do?
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
Do you really think that?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
It is.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Me?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I can't be honest with them.
I'm John McClane.
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
You're all right, Argyle.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
The police...?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Bad for your health anyway.
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
What are you doing?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
What's going on?
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
These seats come out?
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
So... that sure is something.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I know!
Would you do something for me? Please?
I don't have a choice.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Yeah.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
How many you got in there?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
Sonny-boy, one word?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Now, you -- what's your name?
What?
Where's the air conditioning?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
No you don't.
Are you a lawyer?
It's up to you ladies.
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
Ah, Jesus...
He's gone?
We won't have to.
Sonny -
What?
Sal?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
What's wrong?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What are you trying to pull?
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Robbing a bank.
Newsman, not ...
You could give up.
Of course not ...
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
So what?
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Cool it, Choco.
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Not really.
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
Fast and or furious.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Ya back is got.
Yo!
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
How much?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
You the man.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
I thank you.
I hope the block is still standing.
Eddie Lovell.
Ten.
Fifty cents.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Innocent!
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
I'll do.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
WAKE UP!
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Shit!  I forgot.
It's cold.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
You talk to 'em.
I'll do that.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Get the broom.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
HARRY!
O'clock?
What are you wearing?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
You're it.
Owww... refreshing.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
What?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Captain Rob came back?
No one knows?
If you have to ask, you don't know.
You're it.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Well, I'm listening now.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Sorry, Charlie.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So can I come along?
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
I thought I told you to get lost.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
What are you doing here?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Hey you two. Lights out.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
What?
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Are you a Fremen?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
The Voice again.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Uh, beg to differ.
No.  I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
Should I call a doctor?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Don't worry.
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Wow.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
No!  A horror movie star!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
I'm really sorry...
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
B-but it's our money --
Why... yes.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
How's your mother?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Mr. Pekurny.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Al!
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Eddie? ...
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
St. Joseph's.
Hi, Mom. 
Hi. Is Shari here?
Are you sure about this?
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Um...
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Who is it?
Hi.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ohhh...
El/ella -
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Having a problem with your eye there?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
What d'you got?
You're kidding, right?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Looks good to me.
NO, that's fine
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
I guess you know why you're here
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Hello, Mr. M.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Plenty of pep, too.
What a surprise.
So... what do you have to tell me?
Right now?
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
She's doing this to get back at me
Who put you up to this?
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Hell, good luck!
Can I sign yours too?
Yes, Paul?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
Did they deserve it today?
Yeah, I hate them.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
That's him.  That's him.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
You wanted to meet here?
No.
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
And?
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Why?
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
How about White?
On what evidence?
A sweet man.
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Working whores with squad two.
I'm doing a transfer now.
It is?
What kind of a question is that?
Yes.
You knew the deal. No contact.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
Did you call anyone?
That is one ugly sunrise.
Them.
Here?
Drive.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
What are you dialing?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
That's fine.
Very good.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Anything at all?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
What?
I'm sorry.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
You <u>swore</u>!
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
It wasn't me.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Is it over?
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
You don't know who the fuck--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
And then what?
How's the trout?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
You're a moron, you know that?
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Your shoe.
Hey!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Bobby--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
He's kidding.
Dad!
Where've you been?
Yeah.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Jerry--
Ssh!
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta--
What is it you want?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
The originals?
We'd have to--
What about--
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
How'd you get in the building?
How much did you pay?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Do they know them?
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
Why did you hold his collar?
Dance with me.
Shall we be all right?
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Supper. Hana calls after him.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
I think that's called looting.
Oh, all over.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
Oh.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
He's gone, hasn't he?
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I was looking forward to this evening.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Kip?
What are you talking about?
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
The windows don't open.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Where are you at least?
I have a question...
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Very nice.
How much am I paying?
What the hell do I do now?
Motorcycle.
What about your bags?
What's my problem? You want a list?
And good morning.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
I'll need that.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So how long to pop the floor?
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
You bought this for me?
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
He wasn't.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Okay, you're a thief.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Well...What are we doing?
Got it.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
There's always a surprise.
No way to take another day or two?
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
Four billion dollars.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Come on.
Hang on.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
This is just show and tell.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Where've you been?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
How does someone get meningitis?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
What's chromium?
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
At least they made an offer.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
You think there's more?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Is that what you want?
Whoa.  No shit.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Morning!
Ho - ly - shit.
I don't know what to say.
I was wrong.
What is that?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
You're married.
What kind of chromium is it?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
PG& -- Are you sure?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Annabelle Daniels.
You want my number?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
You are someone.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Think you could learn?
No, I need my car --
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Soon, Lord Vader.
You must survive, Luke.
... Luke, you must not go.
... the power?
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
That's right.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We?
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
They're moving away.
Are you crazy!
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
I don't like this.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Get out of here, Lando!
I'll take what's mine now.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
We've got to find Luke.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
My mind fills with so many images.
Will they die?
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
See you in hell, Snake.
Shut up, Plissken.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Defense against what?
75% power.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Later.
What are they?
No screamin' shit.
How do we get out of here?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
Who is Merlin?
I want to thank you.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Yes.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Hello?
Dinner at the White House.
It's serious?
May I ask...?
Oh, she'd love it.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
There is nothing.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
A man to see you.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
So, what causes this?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Where?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Oh my God!
I don't want it.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
Think you can sleep?
Withering Heights.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
No.
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Who is it?
It's my goddamn car!
Just the same.
What's our friend's problem?
You the magician?
Piano.
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Twenty years, Ma ...
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
That's not the point.
Jack.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Count it.
You're their uncle.
Really.  You sleeping?
This time you gotta go.
I made her nervous.
Frank?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Nice, huh?
A gust of wind killed him.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
What's that?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
You all right?
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Hey, Frank.
Just a lucky guess.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Unless you want the right.
Why would I mind?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
How long you been at it?
Couple years.
April.
What?
What do you mean?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
We're not getting paid then.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
How're your hands?
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
So run a little longer.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
What I mean is --
Come on.
Shoes?
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Fucking.
Jack, you with us?
You play all these places?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Hey, we're connected.
What'd she sing?
Wow. You ever see her again?
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Don't worry about it.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
No.
It went well tonight.
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
How do you do it? Every night?
All I said was you were good.
You were good.
Friend.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
The both of them?  In there?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
How'd the show go?
John.  It's good to see you.
What did he do?
He's lying.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Pollux ...
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Now what?
-- Castor?
You killed them?
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
You've got someone in your office.
Castor's escaped!
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Her assistant?
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Excuse me?
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
Where do I go now?
Were friends, arent we?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
Evelyn, right?
Are we finally being honest?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
Hello!
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
How can you do that?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Our life in a nutshell...
You mean this chocolate cake?
You want the cake!?
You really are incredible...
I could stay here forever...
Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
I'm sorry...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Dont get on that plane!
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Those yours too?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
What about his first born?
I had it at four.
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
What's wrong with me?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
What are you doing --
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Okay to proceed.
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
What're you getting at?
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
You mean <I'm> going along?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Doctor...
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
He's making a fine recovery.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
You must carry spare parts --
No need to get up --
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isn't possible.
What can we do?
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Doctor, we've just about had it.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
You said there was a quick way out!
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
I don't believe that.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
I'll never find my way through that.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
One of us pays the other for half.
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
...Blood has been shed.
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
A subconscious-type thing.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Hon? Got the growshries.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Yah!
...Dad?
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
How ya doin', Wade?
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Hiya, Lou.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah?
...Geez.
Yah, that's me.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...This is a nice place.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Nope.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Hello?
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Gustafson's accountant.
...Chief Gunderson?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Not on your feet too much?
Your mallard?
Uh-huh.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
The dynamite...
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
It becomes an addiction.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You're kidding.
I'll take the parasites.
It's for men.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
You hear that?
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Hello?
Tyler?
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
This is how I met --
Well, uh... great.
Insurance'll cover it.
What list?
Yeah.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
I know that.
Where's your car?
What?
Okay... Ghandi.
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
Huh?
We don't need him...
I feel sick.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
"Applicant?"
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
Yes...
You want out?
Defuse the bomb?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Look at me...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Abort the plan.
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Yeah, how?
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
Please, what else could it mean?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Another premonition?
What did you see?
No!  It can't be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
That's why I was there last night.
Is that something you're "feeling?"
4:25.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Carter, get out!
Police are coming.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
I'm sorry we broke in.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Get control of yourself!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Again.
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You better take off.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
I do?
Look, Co...
Why me?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
What's up?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Hello, John.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
What did you want?
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Fine.
What?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
What if I was a relative?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Please don't hurt me?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Have I died?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
... Do you know who I am?
What's her name?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Will you shut-up!!!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
.....What are you doing?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Beautiful night huh?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Don't say that.
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I'm going on over there...
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Sure...
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Robert Eroica...
Robert...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Yeah... I guess so...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
With applesauce?
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Wait...
What?
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
That'll make you happy.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
What?
Yo.
So what's her name?
Come down!
Eddie from Compost?
Like this?
You looking for somebody?
Probably.  One of the many.
You live around here?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
That's what he said.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Greetings, everyone.
So where do you know Alan from?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
So what do you figure?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
That's it.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Why are they after you?
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
Why don't you try suicide?
Do you have a passport?
Will you kill me?
Cute young thing, too.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Alan's in Utah.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You ordered it here?
I mean put clothes on.
What are you talking about?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
What's wrong, Gail?
No.
You can't do that.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Your call is come through.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Two...
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
I do it for love.
You're saying you need money.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
How'd you get this from her?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
You okay?
I came to warn you...
Three hundred.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Ford, you were right!
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Gut feeling.
Yeah, go on...
Two words.  Disco Express.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
I'm still the king!
'Bye, Johnny...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Sal --
Allo... Salvatore...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Comment va-t-elle?
That's in France.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
No, you?
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
No, I don't.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
How do we get to the vault door?
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
What'd you say your name was?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
29 years...?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
It's really you, isn't it?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What are you talking about?
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
When?
Whatta we do now?
Hang on a sec, John.
What?
He took your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
I got it.
How you feeling?
Huh?
You're not looking too good.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
She makes ten.
Which means he probably knew her.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Got a minute?
Are you a good cop, John?
Huh.
Who are you?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What are we gonna do?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Bullseye!
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Never should've let her play.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
So what happened?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
But what if they try and scare us?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
No, I --
Look --
You need to leave.
Steven buggin' you?
Jesus!
Why did you want her body?
Well?
Don't do anything stupid.
I've told you the truth.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Time to check out the waiters.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
What's that?
Jason's here in New York.
Where did you get that alcohol?
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
Did you find Rennie?
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
Can he really take us home?
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
But Rennie...
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
Big mess every time.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
What?
Shoot him.
Had to be him.
What are we talking about?
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Does it feel comfortable?
What about her?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Why won't you tell me your name?
See, Daddy.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
And you've been extremely patient.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Have to hurry back.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Mine was cobalt blue.
But you're his friend.
Home.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
What? Come on, Paisley.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
What was he like?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
They're sparing no one, I see.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Don't underestimate these imposters.
We don't have the manpower.
What are you waiting for?
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
You okay, Jerome?
Suit yourself.
I have to know where you come from.
A day or so.
Where are you taking her?
Not that.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Where?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You didn't know?
What <i>is</i> this place?
I can't.
What is it?
I've got enough here.
What are you doing?
You want to drive?
Where did you get them developed?
What do you want for dinner?
Why are you laughing?
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I don't want to go there.
Who's she?
A man helped me open it...
There may be a hunting party.
You're full of ifs.
You can't trust anything these days.
I want to say something.
We got this far.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
How long before this car's hot?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
What do you have in mind?
How's Mama and the kids?
Come on. How much?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Yes.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Well, he drove it into the river.
I made a mistake.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Really.
I call that regular.
What was bugging Frank?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
And what was that?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Now tell me the truth.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
See you later.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Are you a traveller?
Is he staying the night?
And what you going to do?
You wouldn't.
No chance of that.
Oh, that's nice.
Meaning what?
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
What's that?
You did?
It's too...
That's right?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
...you're absolutely right.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Yes.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Someone should rob the office.
What could somebody get for them?
A job with Graff.
You...
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
That's ridiculous.
I, you know, they should be insured.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
I can't close 'em.
It is dead.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Did they catch...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
What?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Would you excuse us, please...?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
What about the other two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
John.  John...
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
That's alright.
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Mmm.
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
No.  It hadn't.
You robbed the office.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What?
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
Don't.
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Rick...
Yeah.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
And when was that check cashed?
What is?
What's going on here?
She wants her money back.
What...?
You just this morning...
I have the stuff from last year's...
On your pillow.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ready, Frankie.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
I bet you can't guess what happened?
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Where's my brother?
Go on, tell me.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
You're right.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Senator Kane.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I know.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We'll try.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Are we going to eat or what?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What if I say shove it?
So what did you think?
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You did not know?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
I liked it.  We all did.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
What way might that be?
Sorry.  Not today.
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
So it is going to happen after all.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Hey, Boone.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
What are you doing here?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Mr. Kay, sir.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
My monsters?
How's the leg?
What about?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
I know you.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What for?
Where you been, anyway?
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
Have you seen him?
Why didn't you tell me?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
You goin' home?
Any more ...
Hey, Kip ...
Kip -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
I heard you were pumping gas -
So what are you gonna do?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
You hear me?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Dad'd be proud --
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I've missed you, man ...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
On account of Mitch?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
You mentioned that in your letters
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
The alarms go off ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
Whatever do you mean?
The hard part ...
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
How come ... ?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You know what you got here?
What are you doing here, assface?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
The bag with the envelopes.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
Who's gonna do that?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
How's the woman?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
You're kiddin' me.
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
How'd you know where to find me?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
Morgan, Let's go.
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Some other guy?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Chuck, let's go.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
You want us to give you cash right now?
How'd you like that course?
Codebreaking.
What is it?
You're in a safe place, Will.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
Yes.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
--And confuse him--
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Oh, that's nice--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Do you know when you'll be back?
I got one of those too.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
I might understand that.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Probably not.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
So Christ, call her up.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Where were you?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Do you think you're alone?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Don't give me you line of shit.
I know.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Yeah?
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
You grew up around here?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Do you play the piano?
Will? Are you awake?
I know. I just do.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Yes, I do, Will.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
Yeah.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Want to work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Excuse me for asking.
They're all gone--or dead.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Goin' far?
Lookin' for a job?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
But what does *that* prove?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Oh... really?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
I just play my own collection.
That's it?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
That's part of it.
Hello...?
No time.
Is it something you've done?
I was leaving.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
Say more.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
How was your day, today, sir?
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Is that right?
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Did you see Blank in there?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
What's a revival tent?
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
You have a headache?
No, I don't have one.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
So what happened to you?
It didn't work out.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
He's beautiful.
Shit.
Thanks.
Why didn't it work out?
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
Oh, honey... What happened?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
I don't believe this!
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Nothing.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Who's going to want me now?
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
It's me.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
How was the dinner?
Why did you go?
What did he say?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
I miss you, Annie.
Huh-huh. You?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
What was it like?
- See, what you can do for him --...
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
When you figure on branding?
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Of course I have.
Yeah?
Are you afraid of anything?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
It's warmer than I thought.
Jude, you okay?
What, sweetheart?
IT WAS MY TURN!
You shut up, stupid!
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Cool?
Let's keep her.
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
Shit!
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Snoop onto them...
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
What did we learn in school today?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
That's Razor and Blade.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
He's not in this class.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
What the hell are you doing?
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
How?
Shit!!
Good.
Die, dickweeds!
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
A hacker planted the virus.
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Why shouldn't I?
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
It's been eleven months.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
What?
Jamie, wait for me.
Hi Rachel.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
This is starting to spook me.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Where's the radio?
How's it powered?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
Why didn't you wait for me?
What time?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
What's the pumpkin for?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Yes, you can.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Is that all you say?
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Yes, I am.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Right.
Promise?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
PROBABLY going.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh!
I can't resist.
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Yeah.  How are you?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Elliot!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
They're fantastic.
It's so late.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Why should I be afraid?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
...or films you must see or... 
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Oh, yes, you have!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Come on.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Do you miss Frederick?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Isn't that great?
Gee.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
I want to experience childbirth.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Perfect!
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Don't you think she does?
Ohh!
Oh, God...
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
What's the matter?
My script?
Well--
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Well...
No, I haven't.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Well, what about me?
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Right.
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Why are you so upset?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I can't think.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
...how are things at the Hospital?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
What, What, I can't hear you...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Where was the call from.
..It won't be long now, sir...
I like Popcorn...
You give me whatever I want...?
What would <u>that</u> be?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
And how would you know that?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Why?
I know you did what you could.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
My scar is a war-wound.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
...may be the heat....
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...I'm sorry....?
...might I make a suggestion...?
...when I... 
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
...what?
Fine, thank you, but
Ask me when we get home.
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Talia, don't go!
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
What in the hell did you do that for?
Do you really not believe in God?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Don't say that.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I was talking with someone!
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
What do you want from me?
I said I was sorry.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
What is this shit?
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Did to.
You can be so immature!
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
How was the funeral?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
My name is Gina!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
I'm so happy to see you!
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
I think I'm dying . . .
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Him.
This.
I shall call him Diello.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
It's inside a moving car.
Skin cancer.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Sorry.
I understand... I won't-
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Hello I'm Dr...
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
I thought you loved games.
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
It's not that kind of date.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
I didn't even know you had a kid.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Nothin'.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
It's not right, Gale...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
She wants to quit?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Any particular brand?
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
What happened?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
How long does it have to be a new house?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
That's not the case.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
It's fun.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
What did the thermometer say?
Do you see a man?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Even better.
Really?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Yes -- I think it is.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
I'm leaving.
Maybe myself.
As friends -- always as friends.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
Agreed.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
Corpses?
Yes.  How did you know?
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Why do you stare at me like that?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Why not?
Where will you go now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
We found him this morning.
It has to be.
You stayed here again last night?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
What will you do?
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Talley.
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Who sent you?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Not if they're looking at something else.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
You with the cops?
We been through that.  Forget it.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
The cops are comin'!
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Ow!  Shit!
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
You gotta pee?
What happened?
How can we get out?
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
What do you want me to do?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
What is this about?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Please, I don't use guns.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
I don't understand.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Your police are at the gate?
What do you mean, General?
We are better here.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Here, have a sandwich.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Are you sure this is the river road?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Who did you call?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
Our cards, please.
How much?
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
You could have asked for a favor.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
They do not have your connections.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
They are being evacuated.
Go to the roof now.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
That is why they call it coach?
I don't know.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
-- bullshit --
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Melissa!
This thing's going nowhere.
What's in there?
What's down there?
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Or an on-line computer.
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Then who are they?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
You think this is fucking funny??
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
House 2, Guests 0.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
Sorry.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Ghosts killed your father?
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Excuse me?
-- hey! --
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
She's down...
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
I want this one, daddy.
Mommy please help me!
Are we going back to California daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Maura!
You must be a Londrigan.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
This isn't happening...
How long will it take!
Keep talking!
The rain is letting up.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
There's something in there.
Not on station time.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Sure.  Why?
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Yes.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Oh, I don't ...
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Alex, are you....
How.
Don't you just hate kids...
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Hit me with your best shot.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Hudson, don't you understand...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
I hope you know what....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Way to go, Anna.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Bunny, not you too?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
The Shazzammeter!
The Hoopsucker!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Ol' satchel-butt...
-- and she's dynamite!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Hungry, anyway.
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
I'm sure I --
...Certain people are --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I can't print this!
You can't print that!
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
But, Buzz --
Geez, I --
Sir?
...Yeah, go ahead.
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
How's that, Sid?
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
She finds him.
Yellowstone.
She's good, Bennie.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Can't I take it for you?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
In other words, I'm on trial.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
You all right there?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Damn it, Ben --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Anyone special? You know...
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
You want coffee or something?
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Who?
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Please don't.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Forget what?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
I don't ever want to see you.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Hello, Charles.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
And?
Right.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Just thought I'd stop by.
I could say the same thing about you.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
He would have liked that.
No.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Will...I...
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You want me to take you somewhere?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She was only seventeen.
No.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
I told you that was an accident!
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
You're not following procedure.
So you have the answers...
What are we?
I was waiting for you...
But why?
I couldn't prevent it.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
She's no vampire.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
You want death? Is it death you want?
What do you want from me?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
You fool, what have you done?
Unless I make her one of us...
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
And they frighten you?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You can't look at them...
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
Shall we go on?
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I don't know...
Julie?
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
I understand something.
Never do that again.
The shower again?
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
Julie? What's wrong?
I trusted you.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Jeez, that's a full carat --
You stumbled into my hiding place.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
Where is everybody?
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What would I be thinking?
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Do you mind if I go with you?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
Why in the world can't you?
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
You have no car.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
You know where he lives?
Clarence . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
What did you stop it for?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
What's that?
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Is this the place?
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
You're not paid to be a canary.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Yes, you bet.
You want a martini?
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Hello, George, how are you?
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
When?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
With coconuts?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no.
When did you get back?
Where'd you get that dress?
Hi.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Oh, George, George!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
You forgot something.
I can't wait to get there.
Oh, shit.
Don't!
No.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Maybe by now they are.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Hey!
Where to?
Pop....
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
It came up during the meeting.
There is nothing to discuss.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
And sound.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I know you did....
Are you serious?
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Did you say Cable Junction?
When?
Can I go swimming?
Can I go with you today?
Hang on!
I told you, remember?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Me neither.
Tina Wilcox.
Anyone know what time it is?
Maybe it's gone.
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Be careful....
What is it?
What's the lighthouse?
Who wouldn't.
I want Fruit Loops!
Michael....
Yeah.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
We're ready for you.
He's going with you, Doctor.
What's your plan, Brody?
Well, not much longer to go.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
They're coming with us?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
Fine piece of engineering.
I can use a shot of what he's got.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
Recovering nicely.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
So?
What do you mean, we don't?
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Nobody told me.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Why?
How's sleeping beauty?
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
How come?
Herpes?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Polar bears.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Look great, don't I?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Took it this morning.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Come on, let's go.
She still talking to you?
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
I see what you're doing....
I like Grandma's cooking....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
All you all right?
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....
It's just like driving a car....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
You promised me a drink....
Hurry!
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
Can't this thing go any faster?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Yeah....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Maybe I missed you too....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
When I got the grant.....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
What about Carla's gig?
Stop that!
You told me what?
What the hell are you doing?
Jake.
More beautiful with each passing minute...
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Who is who?
Not for me ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Why?
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Is this normal?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Can I see your hands?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Did Amber have a dog?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
You know? How do you know?
Why?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
What does that mean?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
No one has ever dumped me.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Oh Jerry.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Don't let him stay up too late.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Too bad.
-- especially one like this.
Well.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
I don't know --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
What happened to Denver?
I'm sorry, I --
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Rod --
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
--  the kwan.
No, I air-dry.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Thanks for coming.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
What's going on, Jerry?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Udesky.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
I don't remember
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
How was your trip? Profitable?
ALAN!
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
You remember the sounds they made?
Eric, your parents are both here.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
Bonitas.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
How did you know?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
What?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
We took to the rock.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What are they?
I think she's with Sarah!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
So that others would know about this place?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
-- way we could safely --
That little black line?
You've got to be kidding.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Phones are out too.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How many lines of code are there?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Carousel.
Once we have control again we - -
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
And what are those?
- - a gizzard - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
Alan?!
Okay, I'm on channel two.
I know, it's very exciting.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Unpredictability....
Can we chance moving him?
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
I can't see.
Up and down, up and down!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
I can't!  I'm scared!
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Ah - - they're here.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
It's safe?
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
We miss you.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
That's not true...
What's going on?
It's still on.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
Are you going to plead insanity?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
What's that?
Fine -- terrible.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Well, I --
-- Eduard --
Was there something else?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
When I have no reason to doubt.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
What's the matter with you?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
May I ask where your two warders are?
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Ludwig.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
I'm sorry ...
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
It must have been terrifying?
What's that?
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
Sure dear, yes.
Guess!
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Oh no.
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Who?
Gee.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Can't you get him?
He never told me.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
Please.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Spangler says we have a relationship.
You and I -- a relationship.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Where'd you spend last night?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
What?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Some mistake perhaps that --
You must be discouraged.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Well --
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Well?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Are you closing the case?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
What do you have here, Billy?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Show.
You forgot the milk.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Mom--I mean, dad?
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
And what is your present salary?
So do I.
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
I consider it less my failure than his.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Hey, that's terrific.
Please, come, Holiness.
I worry about them.
Mama, my story.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Dalai Lama.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
I need to squeeze this brain.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
I am scared.
They will take Lhasa next.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Please, come in, so cold.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Do you think I must?
I have more men.
I want to go down there.
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Am I running away?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Hmm.
We are here on official business.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Jesus Christ!!
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
Where?  Where?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
He's gonna live?
What are you doing?
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Sorry.
Really--
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
If I'm ever in New York...
Are they feeding?
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
He just came up screaming.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
What?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
They don't believe her.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Are you on drugs?
<u>You</u>?
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
No. He won't come after me.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
What would it take?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
A moth... How did you predict that?
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Time, Pilch! My move.
My God, you've grown up.
Much further?
Are we safe?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
Some say that's the way of it.
One called Magua arrived.
Fort Edward, then?
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
What happened to you?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Le mot d'ordre?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What's wrong?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
And?
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
No way...
Where the hell've you been?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
I need more light on that, Four.
That was a loud one wasn't it?
Something wrong, Cobb?
Shut up, all of you.
No!
Twenty minutes...
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Thank you, Martin.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Personal effects...
If he had his blinkers on--
Yes sir...
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
What is it?
How is he?
It needs blood?
What is it?
Don't spend all day down there.
I'll kill him!
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
Like what?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
You all right back there, mate?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
What they like then?
It must be this one.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Invitations.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
I hope this is the right move.
Hello, can I help you?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
Where did you get those from, a museum?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
That makes it okay?
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Because it's a job?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Sam the Man.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
That the word on our boy?
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
So?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
You were in a fight--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Hey, it's the General.
Where'd he get all this?
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Same as they done in Mexico.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Well--
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad--?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
You going to get married?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Reputation?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
"Mas cerveza por favor."
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Thank you.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
You had to deal with him in running the club.
She finally got in--
You got in late last night.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
People liked him.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
How long have you lived here?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
They got telephones.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
You think we need a new jail?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Otis what?
How much?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Why?
That's Butterfield...
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
What did you find?
Oh Christ.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Is it finished?
... they believe you.
What makes you so sure?
Where the fuck is he?
Are you finished with me?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Him too.
Don't bother.
She has no real grip on reality.
That.
You know Vinovich?
Look, Ma, no wires.
How the fuck do you do that?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Why's that?
You don't think I've got it to give?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
How long have you been married?
Try twenty-five.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
Of course.
No, its easy.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Nice one.
It's bad isn't it?
Do you ever see him?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
What do you want to drink?
I'm going to miss you.
Well... have a good flight.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
Do you like massage?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
You know, eat healthier.
Like Japanese food.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Yeah.
Ok.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
Like popcorn?
See you later.
I miss you.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
I spaced out.
What're these?
I found them in your file box.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
I can take care of myself.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Is he going to be okay?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
You raised me, like a son.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
And also that...
What's that got to do with you?
I'll bet.
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
We need to talk.
Why did he try to kill me?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
You have to say that.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Hello?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
He can see you Thursday.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Monica, what did you do?
There you go.
Which one for tomorrow?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
This brother from my college.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I know.  But chances are...
So how come you could play basketball?
I never knew a girl that could play.
Your Dad play?
What do I have to do?
So?
What's that?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
When'd you get this?
What?
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Hey.
he's just playing, Q...
Hey.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Can we talk?
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
You visiting?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
It just isn't.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
So why'd you give up ball?
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
How was your game?
I just told you.
Sorry.
Why?
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Yeah, hey. Chad.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
...Hello...?
...yeah...
For what?
No.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
About two years ago.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
This is my job.
No.
Eight o'clock?
You really use strong language.
It's fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Just say no.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
-- what kind?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Have you ever been there?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
What happend?
Is it real love?
I have love.
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I'm sick.
He has Phil right now.
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
...cocksucker....
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
Are you asking me that?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Do you have your masters?
What? What? What now?
I don't have to answer your questions.
I live alone.
No I Said.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
No.
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
You want her right now?
What were you saying, Stanley?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
I love you.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
hey.
That's it.
No.
Two years...three years...
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
But you can't say....
Hello?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Where will the money go?
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Hello.
Partridge?
Bottled Water?
Ok.
Yeah.
You ready to keep winning?
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Hi.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
M'lady...?
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
What is that?
Who is he, Aramis?
How is he?
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
Poor Phillippe!
But --
But --
He seeks redemption.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Pull them back!
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
And why are you so glum?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
Do I look all right?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
It's been too long.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Betrothed?  I think not.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I was told this impostor was dead!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Food, moron.
Did they kill him?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
Did you know... about Raoul?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
Yeah?
What did the six-toes have to say?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
What?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Did you read today's paper?
Where up north?
What's going on here?
No, but I'm listening.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
What?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
Are you a regular there?
You don't seem afraid of much.
Don't you guys ever knock?
Long gone, huh?
What about him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
How long do I have?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
Something Lecktor said.
Will?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
Parking permits...
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
I'll cover the back.
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
When do you need it?
You worked out well.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Who?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you see?
Do you have it?
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
Do you know something about that?
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
'Intimate? !"
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
What the hell can I do?
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Hello.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Thanks for the lift.
Yes. Who are you?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Yes, I thought so.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Pictures?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
What were the yards like?
I don't believe in God.
Why does it feel good?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
Excuse me -- ?
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
I'm gonna quit.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
I was very original!
Goals are important.
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Positive.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
We had a deal!!
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
A -- a tourist.
They are dead.  In either case --
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
What?!
Who is it?
You got the money?
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Did you hear that?
He had an accident.
Yes.
Who's coming for me?
No way, no way, this is crazy.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
And she knows what?  Everything?
She helped you?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Tank.
How...?!
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
What does that mean?
Is it?
Should I be?
What are you doing?
No, you... have to be.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Where to?
You got some mouth!
What happened to you Flash?
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
What do you mean?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
Let's get out of here.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Nothing.
Maybe, who knows.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Hey... you got stereo.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
That's your name?
Daddy!
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
I hate parties --
What, honey?
I know you do, darling.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Paillarde of veal.
Honey --!
Red or white?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Well... goodnight.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
It doesn't matter.
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Sit down, Drew.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What are their feelings?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Yeah, that's what he said.
He said that?
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Susan?
Joe --
She's in a great deal of pain.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Yes...
Thank you.
-- Could you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Did you like making love to me?
I like you in a black tie.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
We know so little about each other --
Will it?
What will we do?
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
And what?
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Excellent.  What is it?
And more.
I'll be the judge of that.
Uh --
What the hell do you care?
So that's what love is?
He is --
You are --?
It just occurred to me --
Please.  Talk to me --
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
The 'question' --
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Good morning, Dad.
I don't like to interfere.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
That was wonderful.
Nothing.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I love him.
Are you relieved?
What was that?
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
21.
47.
69.
That's it?
You don't know?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
So you're holding my calls?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Where'd you get it?
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
It's isolated.
Sleep okay?
What?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What's wrong?
What does he want?
How?
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
A BEER, please.
There's a dress code?
My boyfriend told me about you.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
You've read it a hundred times.
What the hell you want to go there for?
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Who?
Why?
You're living.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
We've got to get him out of here.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Prove it.
Unfinished business.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Why would I do that?						    *
With Sonny.  110%.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
How many?
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Is it December?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
You afraid of violence?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
And there's Dmitri...
Stevens?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Where we meeting 'em...?
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
What is going on...?!
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
So what do you want?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Yeah.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
So?
What flowers?
Okay.
Equipment?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
This the load you lost a while back?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You don't seem like no fag...
What for?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Who?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
You know where they are?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Girlfriend?
How's it feel?
How much did you have?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Just got some news on Bell.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
I only got...
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
Great crowd.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
It worked before...
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
What?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
What do you want to know?
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
But what?
Pretty rough so far.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Annie, what is it?
Paul, I know you've been out.
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Hey, Pete.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Marcia, please.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
How I usually find you, Nyah.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
See anything you like?
A change of plans?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
What was the top bid?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh.
- right..where is it?
- this is very disconerting..
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Are you okay?
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.
An idea, yeah.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
And then what?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Yes, I believe that's right.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Let's start from the inside out.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
To friends.
That's S.O.P..
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Did we get it?
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
What?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Whos dead?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
I don't quite follow you.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
What are we downloading?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
He won't be back in a hurry?
Where are you?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Jim...?
Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Jim, its over.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I don't like him.
Cosmo?
You're welcome.
Have I been a good wife?
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Yeah.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
I like it well done.
No.
She was right to leave me.
Loretta.
What about Johnny?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What did I do?
Who painted that?
No thanks.
It's really cold.
I'm afraid of who I am.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Have Something.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
He's my younger brother.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
I have no secrets from my family.
What?
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
What? He's in Sicily!
WHAT!! She was dying!
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Go ahead.
Look.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Well, who is your lord?
A what?
Yes ...
None shall pass.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Are you sure he's got one?
Now what happens?
Ni, ni, ni!
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Too late.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thanks very much.
Well taken, Concorde!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Father, lad.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Well, look er, I ...
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
Well ...
Quick!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Hurry!
I done it again.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
And she sent no word down?
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
Do you?
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
Go inside at once.
Nobody has any rights over me.
What brings you here?
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
She'll think I betrayed her.
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
They're ready now.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
I was told you were in a fight.
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
A fine choice, sir.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Why?
Unwell?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
There is one other matter.
Does that thing work?
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Hello?
What do you mean by "weird"?
Can you turn off the game?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
Something's happened to them.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Then leave her.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
What are you looking for?
You're not coming, Alex.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
What is it?
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
So how do I start?
So start at the beginning...
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
And?
But I'm not broke.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
It's been a very strange day.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
What did I say?
It will work out.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
That's okay.
Betty.
Yes?
No ..........I.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What's wrong?
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
There's nothing?
"You're still here?"
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
I don't think...
What's  the matter now?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
I had a dream about this place.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
No.  I haven't seen any.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
What about Matt ?
Now where do we go ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
I wanted to let his family know....
This is cute.
Where are we going ?
What are you DOING here ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Be very, very quiet...
Don't eat at the console.
Trust is earned not given away.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
What's next ?
Look ! Look !
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
The power went out in half the park.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
What an incredible view !
How's your foot ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Good morning.
THANK YOU.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
So, what's on your mind?
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hi honey.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
I told you it was a long story.
Special effects?
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
My mother can't have any more kids.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Vada?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Your mother?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Thanks
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
Boy, you're really into this.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
...I dropped it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Write me a poem?
No?
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Then you'll be all set.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Arthur!!
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
It's still available I hope?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Hi.
Dance with me?
Rock?
Do you want to?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Dad??
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
What was my mama like?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
No....
Do you like her?
He won't give it to me.
Hi.
No.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Naah, I don't wanna.
THIS!! 
Come on, let's go.
Get up!?
Why are you running away?
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
What?
For what?
Stay, huh?
You think...
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
About Michael's job.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
So... one almost has to...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Uh, Kimmy...?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I saw the show.
Is anybody watching?
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
What's the sec...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You're not eating.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
This thing means that much to y...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Michael...
This is her family and her fault.
Thank God you were here.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Jules, what's wrong...
Maybe it's happy there.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
What's he running for?
How much?
President?
Hey!
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
You bet.
You want me to wait?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You must really like him.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
We don't mess with accessories.
The car broke down.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Hello.
Oh?
Stay.
Thirty?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
It's me. What is it?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
What do you think of him?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
You want a ride into town?
Got me an audition tonight.
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Who isn't?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
How is it?
Do you have a back up.
Yes.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Through the power of the simple word---
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
You can't be serious?
Roger, no.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Who?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
I see.
It sure is.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Fill her up?
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Want to talk to you.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Want to keep your job, boy?
How 'you doing?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Been over to the other mill?
Oh yeah?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
How d'you mean?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Not here, Duff.
But I would like to see you again.
What?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
How old is your boy?
Hi.
I can see why.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Okay.
Like a home, for one thing.
That's right.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How often does he get like that?
Come back some other time, will you?
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
They'll run you out.
Hello.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
So I been told.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Your Raoul?
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
We got any shots?
Take this off.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
You ran without us.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
The access code to your mainframe.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Where the hell have you been?
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Maybe something's onto him.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Get up.
How long will they watch us for?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
You're Pam?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Okay. That's bad.
Now this is cute.
Hi!
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Do you even know these kids?
Gus?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Boys.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
You ruined the whole thing!
Aloha! Welcome!
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
If you went away, what would become of me?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
You know her?
About not finding any bogey men?
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?
It's gone now.
You want to talk about it?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
Yor dad picking the music again?
I'm sure you would.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Jennifer --
I know who's trying to kill you.
I used to live in this house.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Freddy?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
What are these, beauty marks?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Max, where's Kristen?
I don't know...
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Who is he?
Science...I suppose.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I could've saved them.
What did you think?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
C'mon.
I'm in.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
Oh Jesus.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Hi.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Are you busy tonight?
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I have thought about you.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Can I stay a bit longer?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Sorry about that.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Where are you going?
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Is this your first film?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Yes.  What do you think?
Ahm... room service.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Martin -- your customer.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Buggered?
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Oh God no.
Hey.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Which was?
Try 'Flintstone.'
Yes.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Which floor?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Why?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Is there anything else?
Oh, I had them removed.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Welcome back.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Marry who?
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
I second the motion!
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
There they are!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Martini!
What are you doing?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Twenty-five dollars.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
You can come back later!
Let me see your hand!
Hear what?
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Gimme the ball!
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You think it's funny, huh?
Ten bucks.
Somebody's coming!
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
He's a patient, Rose...
Who is he?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
There they are!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Excuse me?
No, really.  What's she doing?
You're sure...
A very large pig.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
We'll KNOW.
Smoking or non-smoking?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Why not?
So were you.
Hi.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
You're Damon Bradley?
Been here long?
Any night.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Scientologist.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Your brother?
I'm hungry.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You expecting somebody you know?
You think he misses me at all?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I never even got to be single.
Hi-iii...
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
No.  No, you go ahead.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
So...
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
A porco?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
And we didn't have to bring another present?
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
And you didn't tell her?
Where is she?
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
Mmhmm.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Wow... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
What happened?  What happened?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
The Golden Warriors.
Listen, you like beer?
Wham... .
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Don't tell me don't tell me!
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Am I on my feet...?
Where you goin'?
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
What did you say?
...walk?
You can!
You all right, Nolan?
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Count this.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros  away and you're a great big hunk of nothing  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
The ropes are coming loose.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
When!?
There are others.
The time...is short.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Did you know that when you married him?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Whatta you think?
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
And she saw you?
You ever wear one of these?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
Hello, Daniel.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Shut up.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Quite a mess.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
So you've done this before, huh?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
How many was that?
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
We still talk, though.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
That's my dad.
Why not?
Don't leave me.
A girl.
You were going to see her?
You getting serious on me now?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Take your sunglasses off.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Looks like tonight.
Thanks for your help.
It's a little late for me.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Have they got Midge up there?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
Meaning?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
And is Foley a part of this?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
You're not my type.
You like to sit down?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
I really gotta go.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
He doesn't even look like that.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
He waved to you?
You wave back?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
How do I look, mama?
Thank you...
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
What lizard?
Yeah.
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Nah, you go on.
Sorry.
Where are we going?
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Well sure, Colonel --
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Oh, this is Betty.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Do you believe in all of that?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
We're going to take you home.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
How do you feel?
Want me to drive you home later?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Come back to me.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Ssh. He's great.
Thank God for that.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
Sort of.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Maddy's party.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
What are you doing?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Sort of.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Silicon is from sand.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
Who was that?
What are you talking about?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I know, Mom.
Yes!
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Don't apologize for me.
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
We're not skipping this treatment.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I know that, Charles.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Find a lawyer?
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
I'm a law suit.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You survived your first gay party intact.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I'll look over the Q and A.
Except... you were gay?
Thanks for coming by.
Rach.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Where's Dad?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Lots.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Have you changed your aftershave?
Joe?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Not when I was in the Navy.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?
There....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
We just keep him locked up forever?
What?
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
This does not help us, Johns.
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Suleiman!
"God is Great," yes?
...then we saw this.
Such as.
Dr. Zaius --
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Look -- she remembers.
Now, just a minute --
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Landon! Join the expedition.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Gorilla hunters ...
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
It's humiliating.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
So what's the problem?
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Come on you can do better than that!
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Where's Lerner?
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
And you, do you believe?
No, thanks...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Whew! - where that come from?
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Right on.
I didn't like it.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
They might think I was running away from something.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
It might be worth a Martini to you.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Cold?
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
I'm sorry.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
But even if you were in love with me.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
Who told you my name?
How are your teeth getting along?
Thank you.
How are you two getting along?
Time for a little chat?
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Passkey?
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
What about me?
I am a fool.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Ye have, have ye?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
Get out of here!
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
To the Fleet.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Thanks.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
One shot stopping.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Sorry.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Got it.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Time for lunch.
Nothing?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Look at you.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Bye.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Mean anything to you?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
What in God's name...?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Congratulations, sir.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Nice car.  Yours?
Stolen?
Better believe it.
Always.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Try a strawberry.
Where'd you go?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Vivian --
You always been rich?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
Fuck off.
Edward, I can't.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Right.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Cynthia's not coming?
Edward, did you hear me?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Get out!
He will come for me.
Every ship but the four you sent.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Catch your breath.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
... as ... you ... wish...
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
We'll never survive.
Singed a bit, were you?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
-hold it, hold it-
Who gets Humperdinck?
Rise and report.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
No.
-- yes --
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You're amazing!
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
"By the light, by the light,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Maybe it's not true!
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
But he has long hair!
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Feeling better?
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
People can hear you.
Okay.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
No. At least I don't recall.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Let's all talk about Mary.
What's your interest?
Why?
I don't know.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Did he say anything about my sister?
Where?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Is Mary... in trouble?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
It's been three.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Yes.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Where'd you go to college?
Huh?
You can't go up there.
We could laze around here a while longer.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
You have something most girls never have.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
A man should have a hobby.
Thank you, Norman.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Looking for me?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
You mean he doesn't work for you?
He's inherited a fortune.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What is it now?
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
We'll be coming to the opening.
But it was really my fault.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
What!
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
No kiddin'.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Why?
Oh, is that what caused it?
Is that a fact?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
Shall we unpack it?
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
She is the soul of that statue.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Two: what if I didn't miss?
What was her name?
What did it want?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Actually, I am, though.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Neither do I.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
He kissed her.
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
That's what she would say herself.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
How goes it, darlin'?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Well, she's back.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
How is she?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, sir.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Strange voices, Rose?
I got an awful bad cold.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
How much?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Who cares?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
What'd I say?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Wh... what... ?!
That's sick.
What's the plan?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
You could start over again with cash like that.
He tried to kill us.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Can't I?
He went to pick up lunch.
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Can't be worse than you.
That's not true.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Jabba's palace.
Yes, my Master.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Vader's on that ship.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Shall we try and go around?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
We're coming!
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Ugh!
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
If that is your destiny.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Well, I'm sorry.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Yes or no will do.
How many languages do you speak?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He might be.  I don't know.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
You did right.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
What guy
Feeling
Dealing
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
...How's the turtle food this week?
Looks quiet, y'know.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's all right -- You're my guest.
'Bout seven.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...I dunno.
Oh, Rocky!
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
How was the flight, Champ?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
I don't like ya face.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
I say ya nothin'!
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Did you hear what I said?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Did ya get the message, kid?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
Help what?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Where is he?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You tricked me, damn you!
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Hold Daughter!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Juliet!
I come for my lady Juliet.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
[Within] Juliet!
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I take thee at thy word.
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I better be getting that.
Now, what did we steal?
It's quite satifactory.
Where's the case?
Shut up!
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
Whoever hired us.
Gregor, is that you?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
You shoot alright.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
I ride with fat-boy...
Is that right?
Same thing, isn't it?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
I borrowed that, too...
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You know him?
What's this?
I never made that claim.
What the fuck happened?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Do we need anything else?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
That's a good question.
You son-of-a-bitch...
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Damn.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
It's the right thing to do.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
You think he's bluffing?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
How are ya?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Hello.
Shopping here?
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
What are you saying?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
You'd do this to me?!
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Is that the mail?
Not in the trunk.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Where are you going?
Carter?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
You're not very good at this, are you?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
No, no, that would be crazy --
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Who?
You sound like that all the time.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Wait!  There's people down there!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Very nice.
Ricky Tan is alive.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Put your arms around me.
What's going on?
You move well.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Who the hell is that?
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
Help me Rhonda.
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
You like it?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no, I dropped it.
What are you doing here?
Not anymore.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Oh my god...what happened to you?
How about a lift home?
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
He is very good.
I am so sorry about your men.
Ahh.
Really?
Got any last minute advice?
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Bob's in a hurry.
Okay, we'll order out.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
What?
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Like her mother.
Getting nervous?
Really?
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Kind of isolated.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
I already explained about that.
About a minute...?
Does it matter?
Used?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Lighten up, wahine.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Let's go.
What?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
I told you.  Nothing --
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
Becky?
No, I know that part --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
It's probably just the flowers --
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
It's you.
All righ...
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
No.
Is he home right now?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
What?!
What?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Listen to this --
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Jonah!
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Do you like baseball?
What about camping?
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
How's Jonah taking it?
Oh.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Got any more ideas?
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Who? A scab?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
No ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
Are you Australian?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Who wouldn't?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
What?
Go ahead.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Oh. Hi.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Really, I don't want to.
Colette, go.
How you holding up?
Where to?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
I'm hurting.
Don't get carried away.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Okay
What?
But I just met you.
Shoot him.
Now get talkin'
Cool it. We got business.
You don't find that repugnant?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
I thought you'd be happy.
Please ... don't do this ...
This the guy?
He's the only one I told.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
When is the deal going down?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Tom, quit fucking around.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
What is that? Rum and coke?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
Yes, sir.
A private, sir?
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
That must be four thousand yards.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
What do you think?
He ain't Wade.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
It seemed appropriate.
Good luck, Captain.
You get a translator, Captain?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Oh, yeah?
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Goddamn it!
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?
Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Shit, sir.
I usually like surprises.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Gee, it's easy.
Yes.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Wait a minute.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I'll put this past my boss
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
Visit her at the home.
You like it?
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
What?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Morning honey.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Are you busy on Saturday?
I'll go.
He does this every year?
You know what?
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
I think you should wear that.
Stop by later.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Seriously, Lloyd.
I know
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Oh boy.
Give me my firebird keys!
We're full on bonded.
What -
What?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's wrong with it?
Thank you.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
They arrived.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
Cotton.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Fair enough.
Where is Sidney's father?
But youll never get away with it.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
This is exactly what I don't want.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Go on, untie him.
She's got guards with her.
He seemed harmless.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
And now, drum roll please...
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
You have every right to be upset.
You broke my heart.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Who is this?
Where are you?
You're getting obvious.
Time to change numbers again?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Can I come with her?
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Hello?
Do you want to die?
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
You ass.
What was that?
What do you want?
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Off the record.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Possibly.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
What'd he say?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
What? She asked.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Ready?
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
So...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Uh-huh.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Who is this?
Uh-huh.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
Yes?
Is this some kind of a joke?
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
So you better leave.
Please don't do this...
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
What are you doing here?
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
Drive by patrol.
Casey! Casey!
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
You owe my mother.
Many times.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
...so call if you need me.
Stu was with me last night.
So what's his reason?
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
That's mature.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
You've left unfinished business before.
Already.
What?  What?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You didn't know.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You should be thanking me.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
There's a bucket here.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
What the fuck is that?
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Why would we?
It is Victor.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
So they ran our list.
How do you know all about this?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Wait... just wait.
He's preaching.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
Slut.
Anything... anything missing or different.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
I say NO!
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
I've come now...
Ay-eh...They was here...
Well, the reward still stands...
Told ya, didn't I?
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Say it. We're beat!
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Was your niece about their age?
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Comancheros...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
She's not a little girl any more.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
They never find that girl.
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
It wasn't much of a letter...
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Where are you going?
Cherry-red Tears.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
I miss Tommi so much.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Where have you been?
She was old.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
What?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Hammer?
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Wait!  Will you desist!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I have a wonderful new play!
How?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
Nobody. The author.
"But new struck nine."
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Will!
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
Who are you, master?
Moonlight!
Oh, do not go
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
She sings too?
What of her bosom?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
How do I offend, my lord?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
What do you think?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
I can't do it.
Who?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
But they know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Well?
I've never seen any of these men before.
That's it, then.
Cameron.
Yes.
Did you know --
I thought you stopped going.
I'm not usually drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
What sort of car?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Now?
Alex.
No.
No.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
You'll wait in the hall?
It's about me and David.
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Downstairs.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
I'm sorry.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What do you do?
It was some guy called Brian.
And he's a patient of yours?
For what?
I write about it?
Same as everyone else.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
I don't know, I think...
Then what's the problem?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
We cannot go into this later.
I know.
George --
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Is she all right?
Are you in love with her?
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
What?
No.
That you're just like your mother.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
-- Well no. It never came up.
Where do you want to do this?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
No! Don't! Please!
Sit down.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Look about last night --
So I'm saying it...
Oh yeah?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Not yet.
Call me!
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
I already said hello.
Egypt.
Right now?
What?
I don't want to fight, George.
Bullshit.
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Please!... that's not like you.
Stop it.
You need a cut.
Said what!
When?
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
You live like a pig.
All night.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Have a drink.
What about Jackie?
You really think so?
All right, who're you with? Jill?
Awww --
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Who were you talking to?
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
I'd like a drink.
Here.
Hi, Leonard.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Poster-Kleiser.
That's right.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You seem disappointed.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Yes.
Yeah, I guess so.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy!
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
I did?
What'll it be?
It's good to see you.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Any ideas yet?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
Did you find anything?
And you didn't see anything at all?
He's still asleep.
Somebody did that to him.
I don't know.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Yes...
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me,
Stay... stay away!
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Have any trouble finding us?
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Thanks.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Mom-!
You all right, Marty?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
What is it?
Was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SPIRIT
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
What you do?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Sure.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Hold on.
Two days.  An hour or so.
What is it, Mary?
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
We need experience.
Are you leaving us?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
The reason?
Sit down.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
And the vow of chastity.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
It never solves anything.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But... wait a minute...
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
I've got to go.
What're you doing?
We're looking for Mike.
I can't see anything in here!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
It's so beautiful...
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
She's... she's a nun.
Certainly not.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
The Widow Windsor.
I manage fine alone.
Out there.  What do you see?
What is it?
I hear nothing.
We are leaving.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
These scars.  How did you get them?
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
What are you on about?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
I have not been able to face him yet.
Returning to the Western Woods?
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
What... what are you doing?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
Yeah, they's good all right.
All right then.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
But maybe just for awhile --
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
How do you know?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
I know he does.
You walk fast, don't you?
I'm ye boy.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
You scared me.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Yes sir.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Will he be supervised?
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Will that be cash or charge?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
What'll it be, Auggie?
What about for you?
How'd you get started?
Hey, man, good to see you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
So what did he say when he called?
Two, right?
You usually get two.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
So. Are we ready?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
And you're giving it to me?
For keeps?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Does it hurt?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
The name is Cyrus Cole.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
What are you talking about?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
You don't believe in God anymore.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
I did.  Boy.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
That's when he fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Cigarette?
We don't let go, you s...
Does it now?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
What happened?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
You're right, Joe.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
You don't see any blood?
You going to call the police?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
This way, Daphne.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Men?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Joe -
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Did you hear that?
What'll I tell him?
And your head is hot.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
I'm a what?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
No!
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
What's wrong with us?
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
This is where I get off.
You're leading again.
Another bridesmaid?
We can have it altered.
Why not?
I don't care.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Anything today?
And you'll be in all evening?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Well, here we are.
Tell what?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
You're not hurt, are you?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'm not interested at all.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
The most wonderful thing happened -
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Good night.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Good evening, sir.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Huh?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Hey.
Nothing, nothing.
Hey, man.
So, whats your point?
Im sorry?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
Who are they?
How did you know that was me?
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Come on.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
I should go.
Whats he do anyway?
Hey, Sal.
Here it is, right here.
What about Sounder?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
You bet we is!
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
Where did it come from, Mama?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Who's Miss Johnson?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Whatcha got there?
Is he gon' be gone long?
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
Where you goin'!?
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
What?
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
I can't believe he's dead.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
You bastards.
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Hello there, children!!
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Guess.
That's gonna take a long time!
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
What about air strikes?
And Bill?
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
But I-
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
I think we're moving.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
Were you going to give it to them?
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Why, didn't they say?
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Look at this...Jesus.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
We don't.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
OK...it's open.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
And what are you going to do?!
I'm in the bridge.
Sooner than later.
So close...
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
In that case, I accept.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
You a mini-golfer?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Three whips. To go.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
I hate fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Sure, Sid.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Think he bought it?
This scam we got going here was your 
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
What the fuck is this?
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
We ain't married no more.
What about bowling?
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
I don't like to talk about it.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
What's your specialty?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Why were you suspended?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
You're really pissing me off.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Don't do it, Norman!
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
You don't think weapons are important?
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
It's not sucking, sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
What?
Ted, get her away from the door.
Some sort of lead or something.
Edmunds?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
You get it straightened out?
That wasn't in there before.
Page 87.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Diphenyl parlene.
A synthetic opium analogue.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You manifested that, Beth.
You're insane.
I never went in that sphere.
Shut up, Beth --
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
For who?  The fish?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
C'mon.
Nice work, Norman.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Getting anywhere with those?
... you there?  Norman?
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
Her legs are in the way.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
How are the others?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
He wasn't feeling well.
You want me to try?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Try this one.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
I'll get the information.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Who are you anyway?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
Are you sure you don't need it?
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
Who's the pilot?
Get to the ship!
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Did you read her mind ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Carmen...?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Do you mean it ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Where'd it come from ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz ?
Way to go, amigo !
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Best in the Fleet !
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
<U>Why</U>...?!
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
Captain, what's the next move?
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
'Commander' Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Hold station.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I still contain fragments of my human half.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
What should you have known?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
I want to rent this one.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I quit the movie.
Why?
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
You get what you pay for.
That: in an act of...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
...who...?
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
I <u>can</u>?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
Uh huh.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What are you doing down there?
Gonna' be good as new.
Great.  Who is it...?
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Thank you.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Why?
...yes.
That's right...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Good morning.
We could live up here, live up in the country.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
What am I gonna do?
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
I wasn't doing business.
I'm sorry.
Big day last night.
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...why am I here...?
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Bobby, don't say anything.
Isn't he...
The prices are going up.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
What else?
What I...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I want you to hear this.
That's my...
We're just talking about the...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
What...?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Where you off to?
I have to talk to you.
Arrest him.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I...?
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I've got a date.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What's in all the bags?
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
We got the permit.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
Where are we?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
Like who?
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
That happens.  To families.
I said...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
I could help with the debate.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You touched it.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
IS THAT YOU?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Rachel's job is she works.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Are you here?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Me too.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Our children.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
We...
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
We don't have any coffee.
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
My boss.
You WHAT?
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
It's just not the right time t...
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
You put filth in my child's mouth.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Not yet.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's just an assignment.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
You have a bay?
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
But really, you never know.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
So whaddya think?
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Get the hell outta here!
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
You're not.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
No.
OK.
So what's going on?
But...you called.
Oh, that's too bad.
You want some?
You a pervert?
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Doubt it.
I'll lead.
What are we going to do!
--be prepared.
Forget about it.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Enjoying the tour so far?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Good.
Agreed--let's move it.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Drop the anchor!
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I guess so.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
Then there's no chance for recall?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Have you tried the recall again?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
They can't touch us at this height.
Where'd they get you?
Release first safety.
Yes, Major.
What happened?
What do you mean?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
I'm okay.  What's up?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Can I have some?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
It was pretty bad, huh?
That was really great.
Yeah!
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Sounds like a bummer.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Stuck with what guy?
Hey, you know me.
Yeah.
Bullshit.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Come on man.
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Yes! Free concert!
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Whoa!
Thanks. See man?
You rich?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
It's coming along.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
Yes, you asshole.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Okay, what would you have done.
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
New ground?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
I've run out of words.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Now?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
No, this has everything to do with you.
You do not want me to do your cover.
Yeah?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Me?
You know, my mom has this saying.
So where are you?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Fuck.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
I sure do.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Oh... What are you working on?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Shut up.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Hannah, we've...
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
I've been hoping to run into you.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Oh, you --
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Why not?
What happened?
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Hello, young fellow.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
What assistant?
We've missed you too, dear.
Or shall I call my servant?
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
I will not have it butchered.
I want you to do this work.
It's getting kind of late --
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
They've come for my car.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
The other guests?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
I made your bed this afternoon.
What doctor?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Paramount is calling.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
I don't feel like it right now.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I don't love you any more.
I'm not mad at you.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
What's a tree?
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
She did that deliberately.
Your hair looks the same.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Nigel, get lost.
I was on Earth...
Shouldnt've done that.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
Me??
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
Now...when do I get a taste?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Anything.
You want to mess with Superman?
How you doing down there?
Who is she?
Who's the other woman?
Thank ...you.
What terrific story?
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
I can't see anything.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Small potatoes.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Who ????
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Does Lois know about this yet?
You'll have to pack quickly.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
DELETE IN CUTTING
Where?
Shhhhhhh!
You must be freezing.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Who is this . . . Superman?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Awesome!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
What's that?
Where's Clark?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
I know, but  --
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Do you know where you're headed?
What now, my love?
Big night coming up?
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
See?
Mr. Romance...
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
I don't understand.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I mean the other one!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Boy!
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Do as I say. Let go!
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
How much do you weigh?
I...uh...
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
What happened?
I understand.
I can help you.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Have you been waiting long?
You're leaving.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
I have to.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
You've talked to Billy?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
What do you think?
It's for the school bazaar.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Yes.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
That's the local bar?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Here we go.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
That's not news, Zoe.
What for?
Yes.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
So you're just the thing we need.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
Yes.
You could see the speedometer?
You remember this?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Yes.
Come on boys, break it up...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Not being partial, are you?
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Can I come out?  No.
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
This sort of thing!
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
We stick in each others craw.
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
My God.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
You sure?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Swear.
You will.
Is it dead?
No!
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you.  I always will.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
And no elbows on the table!
What does he mean, too correct?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
What?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
One of your people told me.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
So, you never heard of him.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Can you handle it?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
You'll learn.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Kyle?
Is this enough?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Hot dogs?
A girl.  You know.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Why were the other two women killed?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Admittedly...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
I'm so sorry.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
See you around.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
There's a ladder here.
Okay.
Then, what good are you?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
Never better.
Call that number.
Trust me.  Call that number.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Tell me you'll call.
What are you doing?
How did those... ?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
Oh... it's a game.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
We provide whatever's lacking.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Guess!
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
You did?  How is he?
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
How concerned should I be?
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Just what I told you.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
And what kind of sleeper?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Yeah.
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Nell!  What's wrong?
And then what happened?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was a stupid thing to do.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
Oh God, we can't get out!
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
That's where she hanged herself.
What did it cost?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
No.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Good night, Theo.
I've never had a pedicure before.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
It's not a compliment.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
I like the colors.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
You broke last time.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
What?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Do you have any friends, man?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Ashamed.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
-- Your employer?
Right.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Overnight.  What about just now?
I don't believe it.
Only in the movies.
I guess you're just habitual.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Fancy it?
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Which kind?
What?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
He's expecting you?
So why would he want to see you.
Pleasure.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Yeah.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
But more or less.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
Right! Strictly business.
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
How much to they want, Dave?
...Dave?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...What's so damn strange about that?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I don't know what's going on. I--
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
OK, how did you know?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
...So, uh, who should I--
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Huh?
Battery's dead.  Shit.
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
We need light in here, stat.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
What's that doing here?
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
Dr. Frock?
Where is that?
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Not that big.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
What?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Mbwun.
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Where would we find it?
Dr. Green...
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
I don't believe it.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
He doesn't care.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
The creator of what?
The memory of who?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What exactly?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Where have you been?
It'd be an adventure.
What're you doing down here?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
What's the hurry?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
How's it going, Truman?
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Special Agent Scully --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
This man's still alive.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
I'm looking for him.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
Do I know you?
How'd you find me?
And what's that?
What was it?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
He didn't mention a park.
And you've never seen anything like that?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
We're going to the morgue.
On whose orders?
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
A virus?
My god...
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
What about Julia?
You think you can do this, don't you?
Where the hell are we?
You sure about this?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
They're hungry.
Who says?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
That's a secret.
Someone looking after her little girl?
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
You were awfully good.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Seemed like a good idea.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
...again.
That's his headache.
...anyway?
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Must you take those?
What is it?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
...expense.
Well?
...be responsible for you in the streets.
What time is it?
Be sensible, Martins.
...of Santa Fe."
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Seems exciting.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Not yet.
Baron Kurtz.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
What else did he tell you?
Passport, please.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
I don't know - I'm American.
Everyone ok?
A shark fin?
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Did you sleep well?
Hi.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
We lost our key.
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, please...
Which is what?
What's he care about?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
It looks a little like a swastika.
And belief follows?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
I don't know. I just want to try it.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
You wouldn't announce it?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
It was a nine millimeter.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
That's all we've got left.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
You missed on purpose.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
Who's this?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
You're leaving?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
What's happened??
No!
The Italian, I presume?
This is a great pleasure.
You forgot the Hula!
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
What else is there?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
Is he alright?  What happened?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
... What's your name again?
What's with the voice?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
It's okay.
... Everything.
Two years younger than you.
What?
... How long was I asleep?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
What's wrong?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Assassin!
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
Who... Who is that?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
We do!
Esther!
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
So, how was I?
This is for "mama and the kids."
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Cut.
What, senorita?
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Why?
Some crazy guy.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Wait 
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Get it out of here!
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Are you all right?
Who was the other man?
Who is he?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Oh-oh! Touch, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Laurence!
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Where is that?
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Who are you?
Where are we?
And who does Friedman work for?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
May I...?
What if it is?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Is it real?  You people are sick.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
You seem very sure about that.
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Five to three. Youre early.
Your lady friend did.
...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.
Why did you kill him?
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
What sums?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
What do you think?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
The English??
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
What did it tell you?
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
Thanks be to God.
You will??
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I really think you...
... as always, majesty...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
5,000 gold crowns.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Who gave you that horse?
How many did he give you?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
What are you doing out here?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
They won't come anyway.
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You think you are ready now?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
My father's.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
I'm going to get a doctor.
Who are you?
And how's Yurek?
For what? For my tie?
Halina?
I've no money.
We're recruiting.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
What's this about?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
But I want to help, I want to.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
What's all that gunfire?
Watch your feet!
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
What's he say?
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
You don't want to learn.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
She wants to see what you can do.
What?
What on?
What does she say?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
And when is the next lesson?
Play a gig.
You the owner here?
Which way are the rooms?
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
How'd ya do?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
You in?
See and raise 1,000.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
It isn't any better.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
You're dreamin', kid.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
What's your next step, Nick?
Why not?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
What?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
What is it? Has he found him?
No.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
How did you ever remember me?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
There. 
Why... in the heart.
Where did you get this gun?
Don't lie to me.
But it isn't bad weather now.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
I never saw him before.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Not without a warrant.
Who's is it?
What about Jorgensen?
He's holding out on you.
Well, what'd you think?
Could this be him?
About three.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I couldn't go near that woman.
I don't like him.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, please, Nick.
I'm not telling anyone.
But what if you need more money?
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
You did... where?
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
I've never heard about you.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
Pretty girl.
Who's that?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Well, don't they?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Why are you saying it?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
How did you get in here?
You worked here?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Where were you going?
What's in the other direction?
They stopped.
They shouldn't have been here.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
You're the one with all the ideas.
You got no reason to do that!
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
It's a combat action.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Wes--
At-at-at-at-at.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Steady it out!
You can't tell anybody about this.
There's a way.
How's this going to work?
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
They're going to kill us!
Think there might be more Iraqis?
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Wes might be right about that.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
We can't just leave him.
No.
And you; you've got it all together.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Epps?
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
What did you say?
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Well?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
What does that mean?
What is this?
Iraqis.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
Now?
Then why did you bring it up?
I've never been under the table before.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
I thought you were through with it!
I've got it!  Astounding!
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
Right now.
We've lost SEN!
Maternity ward, huhh!
What have you done, Cut your hand?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
I'm sorry.
Yes.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Where did you get this?
Now wait just a fucking-
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
So what were they doing here?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Why do you do it?
What's up?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
More metal... sharp edge...
What's wrong?
Which one's which?
Glass, what is it?
Lane oil...
Why are we stopping here?
Alex, please.
What the hell was that?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
T.J., what're you doing?
I'll do it.
Sir...
It's our only option.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
<u>Niente!</u>
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
No.
I would start with cocktails.
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Two weeks and three days.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Thank you!
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Right.
Now, Lily--
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
You like that statue?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Crimson!
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
It could have been marvelous ...
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I think you'd better go.
Your bag?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
You know I don't like that, Rose.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You're distracting me. Go away.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Hello again.
So, you got a name by the way?
Mr. Dawson, I --
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
What's this?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
Jack, must you go?
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
April 14, 1912.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Anya!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Did you find it?
You're coming back--
Could I see you a minute?
I thought you were one of my friends.
Yes--are you?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
What?--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Who with?
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Nix, the law!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
A dollar forty.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Inspector McKinney.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Come in! 
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Hello, young fellow!
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Where do you live?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Oh, there you are--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Get that out of your trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
What for?
I wish I could.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I was in his cabin--
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
I asked where you got him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Ecentus stultorum magister.
That's just my game.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
What's wrong, Doc?
Since when is faro a business?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
Satisfied?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Praise Jesus!
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
What is it?
Just answer.
Always?
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
Wyatt!  My God...
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Well hello, Sherm.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
How did you get this number?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Gone fishing.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
She married a hockey player.
I'll keep that in mind.
Nice to run into you again.
- Shut up!
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Blood or Dutch?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
And number two?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Who's in charge here?
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
I pay my own way.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
You okay?
It was nip and tuck.
Your feet are cold.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
Since this morning.
What did you put on it?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
What's the problem here?
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
How many people do you all feed?
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Where is Skip?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Wow!  Cool!
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Woody, stop it!!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Who is it this time?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
I like plaits.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
He made that. In his off hours.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
You're well built; how old are you?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
So my wife is lying?
About the other night, I'm sorry.
Hi.
Helena --
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
What's that mean?
You do?  What else you do?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
My work keeps me young.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Hello.
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
Did you tell him?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
What's your name?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Come on.
What do you want?
Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
You're too young.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Are you getting out much?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Running time?
Director?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
But you don't have the money?
That's tough.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
What's on the menu this evening?
Six weeks and no sex?
Well, what are you waiting for?
Homeless people?
It could. Yes.
No, no, it's not possible.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
There's got to be a way out of this place.
About the ship...
No special conditions?
What have I done?
Borgus Frat.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Sybok, you must surrender.
I know you better than that.
Sybok.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Hi, Alan.
My dinner.
I want to go to his place.
They'll start to soon enough.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Watch it!
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
What do you think?
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Where are you going?
That's not true, honey--
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Harry?  HARRY?!
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Give me the page.
She's still at my house.						*
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She could be telling the truth.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
I'm sorry, honey.
17 years.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Boris and Doris?
You can trust me completely.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Did you get the letter?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
You got that playing basketball?
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him to look through it.
Bye-bye.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Ask me them again. One by one.
How long have you worked here?
That's a long time.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
A real live pimp?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
No no no no no no no no no...
Is this a joke?
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Naw naw!
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
What?
Yeah.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
The zoo.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He wants to talk ya.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. Not yet.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Wanna count your money?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I really don't know.
What makes you think I would do that?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Keep it.
I don't believe you.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
But a fuckin' baggie.
We gotta get him outta there.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
They forced me to take drugs.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
It's just a shot to calm you.
"Never cry wolf!"
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
You smell so good.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You want me to rob him?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
What....???
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
What?  What did you say?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Any parting words of wisdom?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
Hey!
Hey.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Two-hundred.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What's the matter?
Jake, what is that?
Yes, I have.
Thank you, John.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Is it pretty?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
What are you talking about?
To get my car.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
The trunk.  It's locked.
What happened to your hand?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Now what can I do for you?
I'm not rambling.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
The time wasn't right.
You know what I mean.
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
It's not like that.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Not from where I stand.
What are you babbling about?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
No police.
Hell no!
What?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
I wasn't doing anything.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
Say, what happened to your hand?
I'm a solid man.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Come on, Jake --
What happened to your hand?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
I like that about me, beautiful.
Jesus.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
I don't know how.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
What do you mean?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Grace ... Grace?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Hope is a four-letter word.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
Where ya goin'?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
"Arkady"
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
What's the matter?
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Yes?
How old is Jeb?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Oh shit...
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I remember you.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
I thought he was carrying something.
Are you finished?
How much did you take off?
How are you feeling?
Where were you sitting on the train?
Was your family traveling with you?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
How so?
Well, go get it then.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He said...
He tell you where them others is?
Free ones?
Oh. Yeah.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
They really got all that money, them whores?
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
The... Duck of Death.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
Then... what?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Get some sleep, Kid.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He hit you?
HEY, KID.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
Fuck you.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
Yeah.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I know who he is.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Me too.
Don't hurt me.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You watch your mouth.
I was out of line.
Ready?
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
So this lawyer...
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
You're joking.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
Yes.
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
What book is that?
Mr. Concannon...?
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Just now...
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Yes.
The most respected ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
You know what happened.
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Is this a bad time.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
...he's a good man...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
That's right.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
What are you doing in New York...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
... I understand ...
What?
I used to be a nurse.
A single hour.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
How can I see her, to know her?
Ernie's.
Yes.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
About three years.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Just dinner.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
But I like that one, Scottie.
The color of your hair...
Mmmm.
Come here.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
I'm scared.
Why am I here? What happened?
Please drink your coffee.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
No.
Do you hear anything?
Where were you born?
What else?
No, don't go away!
Go on.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
You believe that I love you?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
How's your love life, Midge?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Just wander.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Jesus.
What's that?
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
Why?
This is pathetic.
Don't point at me.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Don't even start.
We have to call the ambulance.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Are you solid with that?
If anything ever happens to me...
Have you thought about what I said?
My god.
Is everything okay?
I don't think so Boyd.
I got her arm.
What's your fucking point?
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
He's cracked up.
Boyd...What have we done?
I just want to get married.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
May we have the rings please?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
What else have you forgot?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
Time out.
We've got problems here.
Hello.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
What okay?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Who's dead?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
He kept saying he was protected.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
We will.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Stop this, stop this.
How long are you staying?
Was that difficult to get?
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
What will the lady say?
How much is that?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
Me?
What are you thinking about?
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Miss Viridiana ...
Are they going to work here too?
Is she coming back?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Yes -- very, very big!
What about you, Manuel?
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
What the hell happened?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
My God...
SID  NO!!!
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
I don't need a babysitter.
You ready for this?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
I am impressed.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
What the hell's going on?!
How did you find out about the toxin?
Nice work.
How's your pulse?
Where's John?
You and me have nothing in common.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
What about it?
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
No, this is great.
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
What can it hurt.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
...this is a snappy song....
...The Albanian Campaign...
It won't hold.
What crisis?
<u>Do</u> it...
It won't hold.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
...you want us to go to War...
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
...what's the Long View?
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
War's over, Pal. 
He thinks it's too...
Pride of a job-well-done...
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
Oh, MiGod.
Why do people go to war?
...why?
Is there a press conference today?
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
You can't have a war without an enemy.
What?
The War ain't over. 
Yeah...?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Where is he now?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
The Albanian Campaign.
I'm tired.
Show Must Go On.
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
...as of today, 89% favorable.
The hats.
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
... That's what you told us to say.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
It concerns his future!
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Another cup of coffee?
I guess it's time to hit the road.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Know the name?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
What the hell do you want?
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Yeah 
But?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
We're all here, and ready sir!
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Yes?
I started seeing things.
Because he was worried about me.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
What?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Yes?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Who?
You're the flower lady.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Love.
You look a little old for a student.
They're calling me in to work.
Wow.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
How you holding up?
You think he killed her?
Seance.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Okay.  Okay.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
I can't believe this is happening.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
It's just us now.
Did she say that?
Remember how we were?
I just wish you could have heard her.
Norman, you have to look at this!
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
"...for my father."
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
He killed her.
I didn't do that.
You're not at the center.
Norman...
Who did?
What?
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
I was there.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Leave her out of this!
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
How can you be sure?
I'm cooking you dinner.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:Would you stop it!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
With his hands!
Rowan.
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
There is no one here but the dead.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
What do you see...?
Just one.  The bar's closed.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Seems more like a year than a month.
You know...?
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
You sure...?
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
You did that, didn't you...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Wow...
I'm getting --- left behind.
Rowan Mayfair.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
And it can't be forged?
Sugar?
Tell me about your wife...
Tell me how it happened...
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
I don't like sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Well, what do you think?
Just put it in my room
That's good
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Well?
I mean, what do you think?
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
The lesson being?
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Whatever helps you cope.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
You're on the next plane home.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Well? What do you think of her?
Why can't you be nice to me?
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
It's all so complicated.
You're amazing.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
That's probably my office.
He's on the move?
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
You promise you'll finish school?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
But who would run the store?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
You were the new and improved you.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
In a hurry, are we?
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Merritt, Forensics.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
Maybe she used another name.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
It's our job, Gloria.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Will you do me one favor?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
You are.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
He... Sam Lombardo?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
So, where you off to now?
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Willard...
There's only seventy-eight.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
My.  It's gotten longer.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Are you all right?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
They look like acorns.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You gotta promise to feed her.
You!!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
I don't know, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What's the magician's weapon?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
This is not going well.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Milking?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Are you really ever coming back?
How reliable is this kid?
What have you got?
What was that?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You're so sure of that?
You hear me?
You know where he is.
You admit you're lying?
Did you find him?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
John said you're Amish.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
She say where he is?
Is this where we're going?
I don't want to stay here.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Uhh -- yeah --
Our echo.
...have you come back?
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Ahh!  Ah!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Aw, come, come, come --
That's our farm!
...room --
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
...yes.
Oh, my!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
How about a hippopotamus?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Did I scare you?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
...Tin Man!
...junk!
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
You new?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
What is it?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Who is he?
No!  It will cave in!
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
I dont want to be safe!
Was this all about the oil?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
Had a lot of blood in him.
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
His what?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
-- What is it.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
What new information?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Where's Laurie?
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Adrian.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Up yours.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
What do you have?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
How will you fix it?
Whatchu doing here?
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Where are you going?
Who are you?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Aren't you afraid?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Toadies right behind.
You okay?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Help me with this guy.
That's the guy.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you one thing though.
What do you say?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Is that what you're looking for?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
What a strange fellow.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
That's a tough choice.
Well... we'll see.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
I thought you wanted to.
Aye-gor!
What are you doing here?
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music??
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I want that brain.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Yes, Master!
All right -- where is she?
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
May I see your violin?
Right here?
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I know.
No, not sound.
I'm getting tired.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Drink!
Foooooood!
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
