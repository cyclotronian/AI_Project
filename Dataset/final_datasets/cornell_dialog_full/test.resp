<s> Cameron.
<s> You always been this selfish?
<s> No...
<s> Like my fear of wearing pastels?
<s> No.
<s> Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
<s> I don't have to be home 'til two.
<s> Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
<s> It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
<s> So did you
<s> It's just you.
<s> Exactly my point
<s> Never
<s> You burn, you pine, you perish?
<s> Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
<s> They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
<s> It's her favorite band.
<s> Yeah -- we'll see.
<s> Sure
<s> Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
<s> An attempted slit.
<s> Who cares?
<s> Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
<s> Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
<s> And why would I do that?
<s> Funny, you're the only one
<s> Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
<s> What?
<s> Do what?
<s> BIANCA
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
<s> For. . . ?
<s> You know what I mean
<s> Why not?
<s> I thought you were punishing me.
<s> Yeah.  I guess.
<s> Right.
<s> We're your guys.
<s> Just for now.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
<s> Sweet love, renew thy force!
<s> See you next week!
<s> I am, Your Eminence
<s> Excellency, you are right.
<s> Yes... I remember...
<s> There'll be a time.
<s> Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
<s> Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
<s> Chief says...
<s> That's what it says.
<s> Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
<s> Colon!  Don't!
<s> I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
<s> I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
<s> Surely you can do anything you want.
<s> Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
<s> You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
<s> Immediately.
<s> I was all of these.
<s> What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
<s> Can I see your back?
<s> If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
<s> No.
<s> In the kitchen.
<s> If I tell you, will you arrest me?
<s> You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
<s> I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
<s> You ready?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.  I'm okay.
<s> This isn't homicide school.
<s> You got any better ideas?
<s> So am I.
<s> No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
<s> Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
<s> We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
<s> Alright?
<s> That's unique.
<s> My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
<s> Yes.
<s> I want to document my trip to America.
<s> Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
<s> Good idea!
<s> Cut!
<s> Be quiet.  Watch.
<s> Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
<s> No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
<s> I want to hear everything he said.
<s> Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
<s> Evidence.  Of a homicide.
<s> But you knew that, right?
<s> He knew all along.
<s> It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
<s> How did they manage to do that without any communication?
<s> Okay, come on down.
<s> I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
<s> He's got a point.
<s> What is it, Hal?
<s> And don't you worry about it.
<s> I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
<s> Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
<s> Did they have any explanation for this?
<s> Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
<s> I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
<s> In three days, darling, I hope.
<s> How many days until you come home?
<s> Yes, Daddy.
<s> Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
<s> Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
<s> Certainly.
<s> Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
<s> I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
<s> I will if I can, Frank.
<s> There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
<s> Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
<s> Hammond.
<s> You got a real big mouth, convict.
<s> I ain't tired yet.
<s> It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
<s> Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
<s> Yeah, i been waiting three years.
<s> No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
<s> Here's hoping, baby...
<s> Would you guys...
<s> Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
<s> I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
<s> It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
<s> Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
<s> Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
<s> Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
<s> ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
<s> I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
<s> Musta got some primo bondsman.
<s> Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
<s> I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
<s> Luther's on the move...
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
<s> Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
<s> Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
<s> They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
<s> Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
<s> I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
<s> I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
<s> What'd you do?
<s> I guess he got the message...
<s> Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
<s> Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
<s> Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
<s> Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
<s> That's no bull.
<s> Can't complain.
<s> Yeah, old times.
<s> Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
<s> It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
<s> This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
<s> No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
<s> ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
<s> They are robots!
<s> Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
<s> Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
<s> Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
<s> And then?
<s> White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
<s> Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
<s> On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
<s> They are... with me...
<s> You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
<s> So, just how big was this fare?
<s> Take them and put them in a safe place.
<s> You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
<s> I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
<s> Have you pulled yourself together?
<s> How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
<s> This is a police control action..
<s> Uh... not really.
<s> He's on vacation.
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> Fuck it! Hold tight!
<s> What mission?
<s> And the third one?
<s> Why not?
<s> Three of us will never fit in there!
<s> Cornelius..
<s> Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
<s> Learning language.
<s> Apipoussan!
<s> I want to sleep... forever...
<s> Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
<s> Been here long?
<s> "..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
<s> Sure.  I'll call the guy.
<s> I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
<s> I don't know what to say
<s> Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
<s> There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
<s> Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
<s> Move it, dirtbag... !
<s> You betrayed us.
<s> What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
<s> Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
<s> Any good?
<s> It was a lot of fucking money.
<s> What the fuck do you want from me?
<s> What did you do with her body?
<s> Stop talking.
<s> I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
<s> Of what sort?
<s> Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
<s> Never mind how I found you.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
<s> How much?
<s> A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
<s> Nope.
<s> I'm afraid I don't...
<s> No.
<s> I told you I can't, not yet.
<s> You've found missing persons before.
<s> My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
<s> I don't understand, who are... ?
<s> Neil... Neil Cole.
<s> They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
<s> Yes.
<s> Of course.
<s> We're all like that.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
<s> Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
<s> Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
<s> No, you may not.
<s> I don't want to.
<s> But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> It was bad.
<s> Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
<s> Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
<s> Kristen's story really got to her.
<s> Extra money, huh?
<s> Three days.
<s> Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
<s> It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
<s> Don't worry, honey
<s> Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
<s> I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
<s> No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
<s> But Dad --
<s> Had kind of a long night.
<s> When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
<s> Krueger is reality.
<s> That's the only reason you're alive...
<s> Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
<s> If they actually bothered to bury her.
<s> That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
<s> Who?
<s> Faint.
<s> It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
<s> Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
<s> You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
<s> Listen!  Hear that?
<s> I'm with <u>you!</u>
<s> What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
<s> Seems to be all around...
<s> What???
<s> Yes, Griff?
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> What????
<s> <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
<s> As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
<s> Who with?
<s> Huh?
<s> What?
<s> Come where?
<s> The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
<s> Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
<s> But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
<s> No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
<s> Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
<s> Shit! What are we gonna do?
<s> Really.
<s> How'd you get the job?
<s> Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
<s> Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
<s> He sure as hell won't.
<s> I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
<s> Yes.
<s> Grandpa. My father. It's his.
<s> I'm fine, fine.
<s> Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
<s> Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
<s> Mel Gordon.
<s> Okay. She's fine.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
<s> Tonight. Let's get together.
<s> I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
<s> You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
<s> But not now.
<s> What way?
<s> The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
<s> I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
<s> Can --?
<s> Yes. Here's your ticket.
<s> What?
<s> Atta-go.
<s> We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
<s> She's coming.
<s> Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
<s> You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
<s> Love! I'm made of love!
<s> Bang!
<s> There was something. It happened up your way.
<s> He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
<s> No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
<s> What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
<s> Want to know what I think happened?
<s> I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
<s> Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
<s> Well, you aren't the President, dear.
<s> Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
<s> I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
<s> About goddamn time.
<s> Stand by.
<s> The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
<s> A dubious distinction, no?
<s> Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
<s> What do you want with us?
<s> I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
<s> That was war.
<s> You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
<s> Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
<s> Jim...
<s> Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
<s> You'll do it?
<s> Good. Good.
<s> That isn't necessary.
<s> Rose, I don't have time for this.
<s> Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
<s> Both of you.
<s> They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
<s> Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
<s> We're handling it, sir.
<s> This is the President.
<s> Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
<s> You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
<s> That's my job.
<s> Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
<s> How long's it been since you flew, sir?
<s> That just doesn't make any sense.
<s> Commissioner, Aquarius.
<s> Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
<s> Sir?
<s> But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
<s> I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
<s> What word would you use, Elaine?
<s> Simon.
<s> Simon, why has he become so... so...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Negative.
<s> Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
<s> We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
<s> What should I say?
<s> Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
<s> Yes.
<s> Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
<s> Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
<s> Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
<s> People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
<s> Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
<s> Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
<s> That's right.
<s> Yes. Yes, of course.
<s> Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
<s> I remember everything. All I have are memories.
<s> That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
<s> Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
<s> You promise you'll write.
<s> Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
<s> I'm Randy.
<s> Yes?
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
<s> I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
<s> That's right.
<s> Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
<s> I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
<s> Yes...
<s> That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
<s> Nothing.
<s> And that fits?
<s> My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
<s> At the end of the bar.
<s> Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
<s> Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
<s> My wife?  She worries about me.
<s> No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
<s> A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
<s> To the... to the beach?
<s> You must leave me alone on this.
<s> Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
<s> I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
<s> The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
<s> You look very good.
<s> Who else can I ask around here?
<s> ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
<s> Ss'kya'ta'.
<s> That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
<s> Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
<s> Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
<s> Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
<s> Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
<s> She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
<s> Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
<s> Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
<s> I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
<s> She's right.
<s> Dead on all channels.
<s> They're but off!  Do something!
<s> You tell me.  I only work here.
<s> I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
<s> Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
<s> Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
<s> The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
<s> Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
<s> Hudson, give us a break.
<s> Uh, what's next?
<s> How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
<s> Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
<s> What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
<s> I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
<s> Can't be.  That's inside the room!
<s> Yeah.  What?
<s> Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
<s> What about me?
<s> You promise?
<s> I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
<s> Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
<s> You mean dead.
<s> Look!
<s> At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
<s> A Turkish brothel.
<s> Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
<s> I'm so relieved.
<s> Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
<s> Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
<s> Who the devil are you? What do you want?
<s> Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
<s> Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
<s> Eat my - ah!
<s> Stanzi!
<s> These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
<s> Tonight?
<s> Leave him alone!
<s> Money! Money!
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
<s> Enchanted, Madame.
<s> What is it?
<s> Ah, love again.
<s> Well. There it is.
<s> Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
<s> Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
<s> Don't you have a maid?
<s> Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
<s> This is just a game, Papa.
<s> I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
<s> Mine?
<s> I will, sir.
<s> Do any pupils come to the house?
<s> In there, sir.
<s> I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
<s> Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
<s> Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
<s> Can I see it?
<s> Well, we can.
<s> Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
<s> Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
<s> Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
<s> If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
<s> No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
<s> Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
<s> Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
<s> Of course not.
<s> I'm afraid not.
<s> I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
<s> Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
<s> You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
<s> My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
<s> Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
<s> What?
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
<s> Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
<s> Exactly.
<s> But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
<s> Taking out what you should never have put in.
<s> Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
<s> A little modesty would suit you better.
<s> Mozart -
<s> I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
<s> In the sight of God that is a sin.
<s> Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
<s> I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
<s> His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
<s> I did.
<s> Never mind.
<s> Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
<s> Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
<s> Yes, I should think so.
<s> Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
<s> I thought you were asleep.
<s> 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
<s> No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
<s> Will you come with me?
<s> Now I'm embarrassed.
<s> Very nice.
<s> There is only one bed.
<s> I wasn't hallucinating.
<s> Werewolves simply do not exist.
<s> Okay.
<s> A doper werewolf.
<s> Chart says he's from New York.
<s> Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
<s> Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
<s> Oh, come on, tell us.
<s> Where am I?
<s> The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
<s> You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
<s> You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
<s> So they said.
<s> I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
<s> If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
<s> I assume full responsibility.
<s> You ask them.
<s> Come on, I'm freezing.
<s> Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
<s> Do you think it's a dog?
<s> A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
<s> I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
<s> Jack, please go away. Please go away.
<s> What do you think?
<s> The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
<s> Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
<s> Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
<s> No.
<s> But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
<s> Matt?
<s> Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
<s> Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
<s> That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
<s> Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
<s> Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
<s> All right, Jack, all right.
<s> Get out, get out!
<s> Well, aren't you going to invite me?
<s> Don't you know?
<s> Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
<s> No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
<s> Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
<s> John, how's your wife this morning?
<s> Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
<s> Yes.
<s> But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
<s> Now don't you worry about it.
<s> Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
<s> Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> Sure, I think it's swell.
<s> Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
<s> You're protecting somebody.
<s> Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
<s> Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
<s> It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
<s> But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
<s> Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
<s> Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
<s> Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
<s> Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
<s> I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
<s> He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
<s> Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
<s> Okay, Matt.
<s> I'm okay, Matt.
<s> The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
<s> Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
<s> I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
<s> You are a fine figure of a man.
<s> She got two of them.
<s> So what do we do, General Lee?
<s> Sure, cousin.
<s> That's it.
<s> And I'm the better outlaw.
<s> Then let me run the show, General Lee.
<s> Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
<s> Get buckets!
<s> So?
<s> I reckoned.
<s> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> You're doing just fine.
<s> What do you think?
<s> A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
<s> Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
<s> Boys?
<s> We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
<s> What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
<s> I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
<s> And what's this right girl like?
<s> Sparkling rocks?
<s> Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
<s> That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
<s> But I like the presidential suite.
<s> The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
<s> I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
<s> Right here in church?
<s> Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
<s> This time we'll make an exception.
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> Lyla Devereux.
<s> They had to be dealt with!
<s> Move you fools!
<s> Sir?
<s> Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
<s> In English, Pinkerton.
<s> What? Oh, I'm...busy.
<s> Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
<s> Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
<s> Courtney? Dinner?
<s> Is that Donald Trump's car?
<s> Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
<s> Turn the light on.
<s> Take it off.
<s> You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
<s> Yes, Courtney?
<s> Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
<s> It's not that nice.
<s> Everybody's rich.
<s> I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
<s> Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
<s> Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
<s> I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
<s> Calm down. Let's do it anyway
<s> I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
<s> I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
<s> Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
<s> Oh really? That's great.
<s> Two at nine? Perfect.
<s> I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
<s> Negative. Cancel it.
<s> Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
<s> Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
<s> Hello? Jean, I need help!
<s> Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
<s> No. I really don't.
<s> Why would I?
<s> You're at Paul Owen s.
<s> No.
<s> You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
<s> No. I'm okay.
<s> No, I guess it's okay.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> Hang...out?
<s> Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
<s> Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
<s> Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
<s> Not in the mood, I guess.
<s> Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
<s> But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
<s> So who was he with?
<s> Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
<s> It's...it's...all right.
<s> I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
<s> Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
<s> They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
<s> You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
<s> C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
<s> Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
<s> Isn't that -- extreme?
<s> Teddy was killed last night.
<s> I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Milo --
<s> I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
<s> No.
<s> Prick.
<s> He wasn't acting?
<s> It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
<s> I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
<s> Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
<s> Gimme the coordinates?
<s> Is it your dish?
<s> Oh hi.
<s> He's pretty tight with his family.
<s> Low enough to relay internet traffic.
<s> Skywire.
<s> ...Do I?
<s> Well -- you sent for me.
<s> The wrong place?
<s> ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
<s> Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
<s> Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
<s> Keep looking.
<s> I'm calling Gary.
<s> We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
<s> ...Something like that. Yeah.
<s> Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
<s> The Day Care?
<s> They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
<s> But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
<s> And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
<s> I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
<s> Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
<s> He doesn't know about the Day Care.
<s> Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
<s> She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
<s> It's three years old, it --
<s> But you said the other --
<s> Wait a second. He knows I know.
<s> Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
<s> I met this girl.
<s> Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
<s> Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
<s> I'd rather talk about Number Two.
<s> Smashing!
<s> Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
<s> Right away, Exposition.
<s> What's the other?
<s> I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
<s> Yes Basil?
<s> Hey, Mick!
<s> Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
<s> Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
<s> Why?
<s> Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
<s> I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
<s> I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
<s> Lay it on me.
<s> Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
<s> Hey, wait a minute--
<s> What are you saying, son?
<s> Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
<s> Right. Okay. Moving on.
<s> My son?
<s> Thank you, Herr Doctor.
<s> It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
<s> We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
<s> Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
<s> Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
<s> Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
<s> I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
<s> Blow me.
<s> Scott, don't say that...
<s> Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
<s> Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
<s> Seriously?
<s> There are limits?
<s> No need. I'll call again.
<s> Love...
<s> ... power ...
<s> ... love...
<s> Promised? Who promised?
<s> Sir August...?  What now?
<s> Really -- what happened in 1922?
<s> The Institute ... the funding ...
<s> Thanks, Valentine ...
<s> Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
<s> Whereas you are.
<s> Thank you, Trubshaw ...
<s> The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
<s> For a man in my position --
<s> They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
<s> June, July ... August?
<s> Any other vices?
<s> You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
<s> Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
<s> Did he say who?
<s> Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
<s> I thought you didn't.
<s> I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
<s> It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
<s> Not quite.
<s> I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
<s> You're saying I have no choice.
<s> Peter's brother?  But --
<s> Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
<s> We want Mrs. Peel.
<s> She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
<s> Anyone particular in mind?
<s> You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
<s> I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
<s> This way ...
<s> Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
<s> I was at Harrow ...
<s> Debbie's marrying Rick.
<s> I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
<s> Rick's got an important announcement to make.
<s> Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
<s> Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
<s> Bond... James Bond.
<s> You dump her and I'll give you cash.
<s> I'm marrying Debbie.
<s> Oh, come on, just a little.
<s> Mr. Thomerson.
<s> Sure have...
<s> I've tried to change her mind.
<s> You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
<s> About what?
<s> Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
<s> Your mother's not dead.
<s> Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
<s> I don't want that. I want to be with you.
<s> Quiet, Mother.
<s> This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
<s> What do you mean, it changes?
<s> No. Let's at least finish the set.
<s> About what?
<s> And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
<s> Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
<s> Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
<s> Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
<s> Yeah...
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> He's alive.
<s> Just come down, John. Just --
<s> -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
<s> Who asked you?
<s> It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
<s> Hey! You don't know me --
<s> I'm in heaven, Lt.
<s> You got a problem with drilling, probie?
<s> You're selling dad's boat?
<s> -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
<s> I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
<s> They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
<s> What are we going to do about this?
<s> Shut up!
<s> ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
<s> Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
<s> Homey.
<s> Leave Stephen out of this --
<s> -- I work for the city.
<s> Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
<s> I don't have the slightest idea...
<s> After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
<s> You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
<s> -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
<s> I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
<s> No it couldn't.
<s> Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
<s> But the right guess on this is arson.
<s> That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
<s> Yeah? Airtight?
<s> No.
<s> Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
<s> And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
<s> No need to be modest, Brian.
<s> -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
<s> Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
<s> Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
<s> Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
<s> "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
<s> It's in my blood, Willy.
<s> Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
<s> Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
<s> Fixing my roof.
<s> He's got piano lessons.
<s> Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
<s> I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
<s> Did he tell you how we finally met?
<s> And old ladies?
<s> What do you listen to, Stephen?
<s> Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
<s> He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
<s> Me?
<s> Let me think about it.
<s> Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
<s> How about 7 1/2?
<s> I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
<s> Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
<s> I'm on it.
<s> Yeah!
<s> Let's go NIGGERS.
<s> Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
<s> You ain't happy about the green light?
<s> Look at my lips.
<s> Manray needs a job.
<s> Different.
<s> And this is Manray.
<s> My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
<s> DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
<s> I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
<s> ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
<s> I've never been given a fair shot.
<s> I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
<s> This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
<s> In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
<s> I don't know about that plantation angle.
<s> I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> I didn't mean that, in life.
<s> Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
<s> Good.  I'm going to need your support.
<s> Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> The pleasure is mine.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
<s> A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
<s> To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
<s> I feel fine.
<s> Same thing Giuliani said.
<s> If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
<s> Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
<s> I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
<s> It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
<s> C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
<s> If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
<s> What's a Negro.
<s> My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
<s> Thank you.  And always smile.
<s> You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
<s> I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
<s> ...the big apple, New York, New York.
<s> Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
<s> The one with da big...
<s> That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
<s> ...like grits and butter...
<s> Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
<s> Are you trying to rap to me?
<s> Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
<s> I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
<s> Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
<s> If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
<s> I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
<s> Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
<s> This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
<s> The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
<s> It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
<s> I have acted as I think fit.
<s> It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
<s> I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
<s> Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
<s> Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
<s> I will let down the steps for your honor.
<s> I have faced that problem before.
<s> Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
<s> Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
<s> Have you not a man whom you value?
<s> By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
<s> Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
<s> My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
<s> We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
<s> Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
<s> I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
<s> All right, five hundred guineas.
<s> Yes?
<s> Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
<s> And he doesn't care about me?
<s> Tender Hegenheim.
<s> You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
<s> I'm -- I'm sorry...
<s> I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
<s> Can anybody hear me!
<s> We don't know. West is dead.
<s> What do you mean, alone?
<s> Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
<s> Yeah --
<s> No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
<s> Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Your weapons, Sergeant.
<s> Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
<s> West... he's dead.
<s> I...
<s> Yeah...
<s> They?
<s> No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
<s> You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
<s> How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
<s> And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
<s> It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
<s> Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
<s> That's horseshit and you know it.
<s> I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
<s> Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
<s> You're crazy --
<s> That is the most unprofessional --
<s> The very same.
<s> What point?
<s> Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
<s> Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
<s> Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
<s> I don't know.
<s> You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
<s> You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
<s> Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
<s> They got their stories straight.
<s> What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
<s> No death certificates. No crime.
<s> There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
<s> Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
<s> Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
<s> Think it'll work?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Yeah and he doesn't know when --
<s> Oh, you remember now --
<s> Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
<s> It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
<s> Wrong answer --
<s> I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
<s> Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
<s> The fuck are you talking about --
<s> Shut up!
<s> No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
<s> Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
<s> Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
<s> That's great.
<s> Who is she? Where does she live?
<s> The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
<s> It truly is.
<s> No one's ever left.
<s> Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
<s> My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
<s> No.
<s> Was she nekkid?
<s> I can get it. I can just...
<s> Please?
<s> Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
<s> Really.
<s> So how does it happen?
<s> What did he say?
<s> Really.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
<s> The river?
<s> Like this.
<s> You say...
<s> Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
<s> But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
<s> Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
<s> Yes.
<s> We'll have to pick up a copy.
<s> I do.
<s> Did you?
<s> That's because most of it never happened.
<s> But it's not true.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
<s> Yes. But that's a different...
<s> Yes?
<s> I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
<s> Uh... Yes.
<s> I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
<s> Good. 
<s> Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
<s> You're asking for my documents?
<s> No. It is too judgmental.
<s> What? What does he want?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Syevodnya
<s> Yes I know.
<s> Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
<s> You don't understand anything.
<s> It's makes it easier. Okay.
<s> No I don't.
<s> No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
<s> I said I don't have any.
<s> It's none of your business.
<s> Why not?
<s> Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
<s> Please, there's no... Oh.
<s> Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
<s> I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
<s> Well what have you got?
<s> It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
<s> Laugh it up.
<s> Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
<s> What was her name?
<s> I'm not asking you to marry me.
<s> Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You hurt it?
<s> Yes?
<s> At church?
<s> Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
<s> Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
<s> Yeah. Transmission's shot.
<s> You gonna miss your bus.
<s> You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
<s> I begged him not to go. And he did.
<s> If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
<s> Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
<s> Two days?
<s> Well I don't...
<s> Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
<s> Yeah, gal I been here before.
<s> Don't think that'd be wise.
<s> You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
<s> R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
<s> I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
<s> Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> All that shit's on aisle 5.
<s> The hell are you talkin' about?
<s> What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
<s> The hell you call me?
<s> Let go...
<s> Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
<s> Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
<s> The Wolf?
<s> Beats forty hours on a plane.
<s> Number five with a bullet.
<s> Go to sleep, Charlie.
<s> Let's grab some food.
<s> You said that in the last two places.
<s> What'd she say?
<s> Where would you look for the mafia?
<s> He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
<s> Good.  Very good...
<s> Shut-up.
<s> A resort city, Beppu.
<s> A wife.  She left.
<s> Yes...
<s> Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
<s> What do you chant?
<s> I want him.
<s> You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
<s> You certainly have a nice place here.
<s> Come here.
<s> Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
<s> Dr. Tyrell?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yeah.  I got it.
<s> Day after tomorrow.
<s> Shot of vodka, please.
<s> Ya.
<s> Prosit.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Four years.
<s> Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
<s> Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> Huh huh.
<s> True.
<s> Me too.
<s> Do you recognize any of them?
<s> What's suck night?
<s> I don't know nothing about it.
<s> Ugh.
<s> I work alone.
<s> There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
<s> I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
<s> You mean a woman?
<s> What difference will it make?
<s> Yes.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> How do you know I'm not?
<s> What one?
<s> What desert?
<s> Hi.
<s> I don't have one.
<s> We sure did.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
<s> What's your problem?
<s> Is that why you're still here?
<s> I keep a lot of provisions right here.
<s> Thank-Q!
<s> I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
<s> What?!
<s> Do ya?
<s> Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, I could die...
<s> Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
<s> It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
<s> I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
<s> And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
<s> No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
<s> A wife?
<s> Everybody's divorced.
<s> That's what I was afraid of.
<s> Is this your house?
<s> Good for you.
<s> Sure.
<s> No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
<s> Uh...yeah.
<s> Good-bye!
<s> Not that one!
<s> And don't be so obvious!
<s> Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
<s> Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
<s> Well, you had better!!
<s> Sing it to me.
<s> Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
<s> Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
<s> No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
<s> Yes, sir.  Is that all?
<s> I'll try.
<s> I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
<s> Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
<s> How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
<s> Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
<s> True.
<s> No.
<s> How 'bout we check with Eve first?
<s> I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
<s> Yeah...Seems to.
<s> Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
<s> I was thinking of selling all the cards.
<s> Well, we're here to help!
<s> Oh, you got a problem with that?
<s> Sorry, Mom!
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> And now you must let me be the judge of that!
<s> The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
<s> Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
<s> I never know anymore.
<s> I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
<s> Yes, dear!
<s> Yes...
<s> Mutants?!
<s> No.
<s> We do?
<s> Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
<s> And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
<s> Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
<s> He's from Alaska.
<s> Always good advice.
<s> Eve?!
<s> Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
<s> From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
<s> You're goddamn right I am!
<s> I know...I know. You did the right thing.
<s> What?!
<s> Fallout shelter.
<s> Give it back to him.
<s> Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
<s> The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
<s> Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
<s> Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
<s> Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
<s> Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
<s> Yes sir. I sure am.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Oh my God. Is her son OK?
<s> Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
<s> Jeffrey nothing.
<s> Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
<s> Do you know?
<s> Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
<s> No.
<s> No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
<s> Sure I do.
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> Beeeee careful.
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> Don? Where is he?
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> Oh he forced you, huh?
<s> A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
<s> Mom.
<s> This is it.
<s> I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
<s> Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> Terrible boring.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
<s> I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
<s> I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
<s> Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
<s> You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
<s> Why not?
<s> He got a little jealous.
<s> Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
<s> I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
<s> No.
<s> I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
<s> Dorothy Vallens?
<s> Yeah, nice meetin' you.
<s> Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
<s> Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
<s> Get a hold of yourself, man.
<s> Yes.
<s> This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
<s> Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
<s> Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
<s> We... met them last night.
<s> A bit.
<s> Yes, we are.
<s> So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
<s> Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
<s> And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
<s> Okay then... let's get ya started.
<s> Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
<s> Rocco!
<s> You... oh god, why?
<s> He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
<s> Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
<s> What about one guy with two guns?
<s> Hallelujah, Jaffar.
<s> Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
<s> Yeah. Anybody call for me?
<s> You sure you killed them?
<s> Y'know it is, a bit.
<s> So?
<s> Well, what'ya do?
<s> Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
<s> What the fuck do you mean?
<s> Y-Yes my son.
<s> Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
<s> Open it!
<s> Just go!
<s> Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
<s> Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
<s> Dignan, it's --
<s> No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
<s> See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
<s> But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
<s> I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
<s> That sets it off.
<s> Eight dollars.
<s> Look at the treads on those.
<s> Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
<s> You were asleep.
<s> Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
<s> He seems pretty good.
<s> Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
<s> Roger.
<s> Any activity?
<s> Behind Bob's house.
<s> Dignan, I --
<s> Thanks.
<s> It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
<s> Grammar.
<s> So do I.
<s> I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
<s> Take a deep breath.
<s> Me?
<s> Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
<s> Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
<s> Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
<s> I don't know. Sure, I guess.
<s> He looked too shaken-up.
<s> Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
<s> That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> It was stupid.
<s> Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
<s> No.
<s> Cuba.
<s> Like silk?
<s> That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
<s> We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
<s> It seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> What are you talking about, Bob?
<s> Good question.
<s> I told you he's crazy.
<s> I warned you, Dignan.
<s> Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
<s> Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
<s> I told you they were there.
<s> See you in a little while.
<s> I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
<s> We'll have to see when we get back.
<s> His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
<s> What is it?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Not a whole lot, Bob.
<s> Man, I don't want to go into this.
<s> Look. We want you on the job.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Stand by. Bird Dog?
<s> I think so.
<s> What's that?
<s> No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
<s> Where's that guy going?
<s> I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
<s> Got a little lucky.
<s> Mr. Henry?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I want to know about Treadstone.
<s> It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
<s> And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
<s> The sooner the better.
<s> It was staged?
<s> What?
<s> Then what?
<s> YOU'RE A LIAR!
<s> No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
<s> Felt a little light.
<s> Sorry. Old habits.
<s> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I worry when you get like this.
<s> We pushed it. We got lazy.
<s> It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
<s> Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
<s> -- where? -
<s> What if it's not who you think it is?
<s> It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
<s> I killed him???
<s> Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
<s> I want someone I know to take me in.
<s> What?
<s> But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
<s> Here?
<s> Is there. Is all there.
<s> That's where we came out.
<s> Before this? Before Bourne? No.
<s> I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
<s> These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
<s> No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
<s> Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
<s> Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
<s> I don't want to leave.
<s> My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
<s> I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
<s> Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
<s> So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
<s> But if we have not caught Wallace --
<s> Fourteen? --
<s> Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
<s> My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
<s> Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
<s> Thank you for inviting.
<s> Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
<s> SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
<s> Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
<s> I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
<s> When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
<s> A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
<s> It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
<s> When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
<s> Shit. I knew you were crazy.
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you sure? Not even with my father?
<s> Where are my goddamn books?
<s> Photos?
<s> You really don't remember anything that happened?
<s> Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
<s> I've stopped a hundred times.
<s> They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
<s> Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
<s> Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
<s> I walk differently?
<s> I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
<s> He's a fucking maniac!
<s> Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
<s> Different? How?
<s> I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
<s> Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
<s> Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
<s> It's crossed my mind from time to time.
<s> It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
<s> ...yes.
<s> Who's to say you can't make things better?
<s> Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
<s> Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
<s> Y... yes. I guess I did.
<s> Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
<s> Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
<s> None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
<s> Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
<s> I came with Captain Renault.
<s> Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
<s> Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
<s> -- He's just a lucky guy.
<s> Yes, Monsieur.
<s> No thanks, Carl.
<s> It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
<s> It's not for sale at any price.
<s> I'll tell him when he comes in.
<s> Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
<s> Yes, something.
<s> Good day.
<s> This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
<s> Occupied France?
<s> I will.
<s> -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
<s> Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
<s> Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
<s> Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
<s> No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
<s> What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
<s> I don't have to. I've got them right here.
<s> Because you're getting on that plane.
<s> If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
<s> Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
<s> But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
<s> He suggested I ask you.
<s> Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes, I get the point.
<s> You love her that much?
<s> Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
<s> No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
<s> We'll be there.
<s> -- Thank you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you quite finished with us?
<s> Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
<s> Champagne and a tin of caviar.
<s> I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
<s> If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
<s> But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
<s> I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
<s> His escape.
<s> Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
<s> I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
<s> That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
<s> Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
<s> Yeah? Why?
<s> I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
<s> There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
<s> I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
<s> I never make plans that far ahead.
<s> There seems to be no secret about that.
<s> Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
<s> You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
<s> In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
<s> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
<s> Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
<s> Hello Ugarte.
<s> For how long?
<s> I don't want them here overnight.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Six kilometers.  Four miles.
<s> Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
<s> No!
<s> I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
<s> There was an unavoidable delay.
<s> He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
<s> Well, not really, I --
<s> Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
<s> Had a package to deliver.
<s> You smell like formaldehyde.
<s> A ring.  I wanted a ring.
<s> Could you watch Jango?
<s> It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
<s> I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
<s> I thought you might have.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
<s> And how was your Christmas?
<s> Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
<s> Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
<s> You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
<s> It's me.
<s> I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
<s> To Wilson.
<s> What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
<s> To life.
<s> Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
<s> San Francisco.  And you?
<s> Life is waiting.
<s> Good night, Daddy.
<s> I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
<s> I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
<s> She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
<s> You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
<s> Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
<s> I never *asked* for any responsibility.
<s> You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
<s> It will be okay.
<s> You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
<s> Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
<s> I know what you've been doing.
<s> They wanted a girl.
<s> Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
<s> Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
<s> When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
<s> Right?
<s> All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
<s> One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
<s> No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
<s> You do it then.
<s> I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
<s> Of course.
<s> You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
<s> Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
<s> We heard that one already, Homer.
<s> So what?
<s> When will he be home, Major?
<s> She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
<s> The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
<s> Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
<s> You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
<s> What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
<s> You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
<s> Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
<s> And these cops? What do they get?
<s> That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
<s> Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
<s> Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
<s> You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
<s> Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
<s> I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
<s> The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
<s> It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
<s> I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
<s> You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
<s> I think two million.
<s> I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
<s> I said take off your fucking shirt.
<s> No thanks. I'm good.
<s> Something stupid.
<s> My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
<s> LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
<s> What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
<s> Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
<s> Glenn talked you out of it.
<s> Lily... Jesus Christ...
<s> I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
<s> There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
<s> No, I want my cut!
<s> Miles...
<s> And we got rid of the red head.
<s> You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
<s> With identification.
<s> Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
<s> Keep it up.
<s> What?
<s> Eee Oott Auught!
<s> He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
<s> I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
<s> What do you get out of it?
<s> It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
<s> Whoa, whoa... There he is.
<s> Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
<s> How about five hundred.
<s> Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
<s> I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
<s> I'm working on that soccer story.
<s> South African women are very sporty.
<s> Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Not entirely.
<s> Tension. It'll go.
<s> I'll see you in my dreams.
<s> Do you have to swear all the time?
<s> Marion, stop this.
<s> I'm on at nine.
<s> Gambling's not about money.
<s> Marion!  What did you tell the police?
<s> Then what?
<s> Leave me alone, Marion.
<s> Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
<s> All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
<s> You know where I'm from?
<s> So why did you come to my casino?
<s> The debts.
<s> Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
<s> Who's they?
<s> What for?
<s> Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
<s> Are you going to put a spell on me?
<s> How long have you worked at the casino?
<s> Some other time.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Rough life, Jack.
<s> I was at Beadles.
<s> What happens if I want to sneeze?
<s> I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
<s> Yes.
<s> Fine.
<s> All right, Mr Reynolds.
<s> What flickering light?
<s> Oh. What's wrong now?
<s> Key?
<s> All right, then...
<s> Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
<s> Energy shielding positive function.
<s> Armed.
<s> I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Hey, bomb.
<s> And I saw that I was alone.
<s> I am always receptive to suggestions.
<s> That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
<s> To explode, of course.
<s> Of course not.
<s> True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
<s> They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
<s> Yes, Talby, what is it?
<s> Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
<s> Yeah?
<s> It didn't work?
<s> Doolittle, hello?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm on a break.
<s> Yeah, sure, I understand.
<s> That's not why we're here.
<s> Leave.  Now.
<s> Justine was not an unwilling participant.
<s> No time.
<s> I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
<s> Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
<s> Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
<s> I don't get involved with guns.
<s> We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
<s> Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
<s> Whoever that is.
<s> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
<s> Yes on all counts.
<s> And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
<s> We're quoting Mom again.
<s> And you still think you can do something to change that.
<s> To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
<s> Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
<s> He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
<s> Bastard...
<s> Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
<s> Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
<s> I just don't go in with any expectations.
<s> You know what I'm saying.
<s> How long you and me known each other?
<s> Later.
<s> I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Lydia.
<s> She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
<s> Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
<s> None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
<s> Say the words, "I understand."
<s> Shut-up...
<s> How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
<s> I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
<s> Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
<s> Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
<s> I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
<s> He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
<s> You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Believe it.
<s> I don't care. I wanna hear more.
<s> I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
<s> Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
<s> Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
<s> Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
<s> I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
<s> So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
<s> And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
<s> Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
<s> Curly.
<s> Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
<s> I'm really sorry about that, man.
<s> Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
<s> NOW!
<s> You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
<s> Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
<s> A bustier?
<s> Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
<s> You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
<s> Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
<s> Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
<s> It's not nearly enough, punk.
<s> Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
<s> Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
<s> Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
<s> If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
<s> We went to a hotel.
<s> Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
<s> He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
<s> Wonder where we'll be then.
<s> No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
<s> Hey. You OK?
<s> No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
<s> Where it came from?
<s> So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
<s> You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
<s> I guess she just lost faith in the world.
<s> I know, Dad.
<s> He said to follow him.
<s> Gretchen. We're going together now.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. That makes you keep searching.
<s> It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
<s> How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
<s> Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
<s> Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
<s> Because you tell Mom everything.
<s> Okay, but it has to be a small one.
<s> Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
<s> Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
<s> I guess they made him do it.
<s> But now you can't go.
<s> Raspberry.
<s> Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
<s> I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
<s> Okay.
<s> This came for you, sweetie.
<s> Airport Ho-Jo!
<s> Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
<s> Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
<s> Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
<s> We was robbed.
<s> Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
<s> Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
<s> Bitch!
<s> Yes, Leslie!
<s> Hi.
<s> Hi.
<s> Shut it up, Loretta.
<s> I'll be right back. See ya later.
<s> Okay. Take her purse.
<s> Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> "Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
<s> Tammy Curry?
<s> Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
<s> Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
<s> Gladys! Stop it!
<s> Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
<s> That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
<s> It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
<s> Enid ate a whole pan!
<s> English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
<s> He should be king!
<s> And everything.  He should be king!
<s> Take a letter.
<s> "My President"...
<s> All right -
<s> You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
<s> You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
<s> Did you shoot the rapids?
<s> Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
<s> He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
<s> She did.
<s> That's not bad for any day.
<s> Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
<s> Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
<s> This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
<s> Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
<s> $50?
<s> Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
<s> Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
<s> He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
<s> Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
<s> WHAT  ?
<s> The king can do no wrong!
<s> Well no -- not exactly -- but --
<s> I didn't come here to be insulted.
<s> Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
<s> Two, please.
<s> And here are my mother and father.
<s> Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
<s> Everything will be seen to.
<s> Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
<s> Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
<s> No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
<s> I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
<s> He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
<s> O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
<s> Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
<s> Good day, Mr. Merrick.
<s> I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
<s> y-y-yes--
<s> The main spire.
<s> Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
<s> Hello, my name is John Merrick.
<s> But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
<s> Of course! What did you think?
<s> Oh, our relatives... the children.
<s> Of course.
<s> Your mother?
<s> John.... how can you ever forgive me?
<s> Then I shouldn't change anything?
<s> You too, my friend. Goodnight.
<s> I've heard.
<s> Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
<s> I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
<s> A dressing bag.
<s> Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
<s> Ah! It's my father!
<s> Who, Father?
<s> These? What are THESE? They're swords.
<s> PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
<s> And I thought you said it was something special...
<s> Five this week; how many the week before?
<s> No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
<s> Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> It is day, of course, Freya.
<s> The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
<s> The Gods are asleep, Erik.
<s> That I cannot tell you.
<s> The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
<s> That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
<s> Well, how d'you think I feel?
<s> Yes... oh, yes...
<s> What -- rape?
<s> And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
<s> I don't know! I just did!
<s> He was lucky...  Sit there.
<s> I know. I know.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Sorry!
<s> You may need a real Berserk.
<s> You'll see!
<s> We don't HAVE to help anybody.
<s> Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
<s> To the oars!
<s> Just say something cheerful.
<s> We haven't got a spare place.
<s> She MUST have a knife or something...
<s> I have to go...
<s> Bye... sorry...
<s> The Dragon...
<s> How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
<s> Bastard.
<s> She knows it was our fault!
<s> So did your father...
<s> Dad!
<s> Neither am I.
<s> No, Mother.
<s> They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
<s> But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
<s> Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
<s> Hi.
<s> Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
<s> No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
<s> Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
<s> Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
<s> Yes?
<s> That's okay.
<s> I don't want to take you out of your way.
<s> You're not a stalker or anything, right?
<s> You know Wilmont?
<s> I know a man who needs a refill.
<s> It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> That's scary sounding.
<s> I think so.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm right here.
<s> Really? Is he cute?
<s> This is our first "date" date.
<s> Come up and see me... now.
<s> I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm nervous, too.
<s> Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
<s> God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
<s> Guess what I'm wearing.
<s> Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
<s> Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
<s> There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
<s> I'm like a joke to them.
<s> The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
<s> Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
<s> I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
<s> Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
<s> Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
<s> You have to stop this!
<s> I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
<s> I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
<s> I better do this, Stan.
<s> Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
<s> You better go.
<s> And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
<s> Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
<s> That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
<s> It's no big deal.
<s> I have a family, Mary.
<s> Did you try going through C-Gate?
<s> Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
<s> Maybe after the holidays then.
<s> Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
<s> Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
<s> Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
<s> She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
<s> Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
<s> Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
<s> Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichs and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
<s> About...
<s> You don't agree with Debbie, then?
<s> So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
<s> Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
<s> Well.... er...
<s> Bonanza Jellybean?
<s> Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
<s> Don't start with me, Cooper.
<s> You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
<s> Hold on, Coop...
<s> We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
<s> It is not.
<s> Hurry.
<s> Trauma.
<s> Oh God...
<s> Pressure?
<s> He's crashing...
<s> I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
<s> It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
<s> It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
<s> Start the countdown.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
<s> ...you okay?
<s> I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
<s> Where has it been for the last seven years?
<s> NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
<s> Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
<s> It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
<s> Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
<s> I don't know...
<s> I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
<s> NOOO!
<s> Smith, where the hell have you been?!
<s> Captain, we got a problem.
<s> I just finished drying...
<s> How much oh-two do we have?
<s> What is it, Starck?
<s> To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
<s> Keep him talking.
<s> Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
<s> She's not ugly.
<s> It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
<s> Get them back --
<s> How?
<s> Do they have pressure?
<s> I'm alright. Please.
<s> It means nothing.
<s> Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
<s> I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
<s> My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
<s> Victor did.
<s> The suit will stretch. You should try it --
<s> It's easy for you to be patient.
<s> He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
<s> Deb, it's me. It's still me.
<s> I already got it. Everything I want.
<s> External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
<s> Should?
<s> I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
<s> Got it, teach.
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
<s> Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
<s> I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
<s> Stay right. Left is trouble.
<s> Last one down springs for room service.
<s> You've been working out.
<s> What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
<s> Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<s> Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
<s> Girl...?!
<s> At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
<s> Showtime.
<s> Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
<s> Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
<s> Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
<s> You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
<s> The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> Not at all.
<s> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<s> I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
<s> Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
<s> Raising the shields.
<s> I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
<s> Susan. What are you doing?
<s> For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
<s> You want to work at Carl's?
<s> This is how I dress all the time.
<s> No. I want my money back right now.
<s> Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
<s> No.
<s> So are you.  Are you shaking?
<s> What? Are you all right?
<s> All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
<s> What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
<s> No.
<s> You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
<s> No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
<s> Damone! You come here?
<s> Really.
<s> Chicken!
<s> Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
<s> You're crazy. Those girls love me.
<s> Whatever you say, Rat.
<s> Sensitive -- what is that?
<s> And they don't call my parents?
<s> How often do you go?
<s> Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
<s> Really?
<s> No way! He just called him a dick.
<s> I know.
<s> Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
<s> Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
<s> You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
<s> I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
<s> You're right. I didn't tell you that.
<s> Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
<s> He's not coming.
<s> Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
<s> No problem.
<s> Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
<s> Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
<s> Two Cokes.
<s> I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
<s> Yes... It makes sense.
<s> Crying? Why was she crying?
<s> Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
<s> Damn right!
<s> Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
<s> But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
<s> Not yet. I want to study its habits.
<s> I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
<s> Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
<s> Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
<s> GO?
<s> OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
<s> No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
<s> Are you ready?
<s> ...and every one of them stacked naked...
<s> Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
<s> How much is the lemon meringue pie?
<s> I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about!
<s> Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
<s> One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
<s> I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
<s> Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
<s> "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
<s> What?
<s> Who's with me?
<s> What's in the back?
<s> Magic potion.  You should try a little.
<s> You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
<s> He only shot you once.
<s> Huh?
<s> Fully.
<s> What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
<s> Get outta here.
<s> No bullshit.
<s> Move slow and move quiet.
<s> You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
<s> HELLLPPP!
<s> Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
<s> Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
<s> Whoa!
<s> Oh...
<s> I'll do anything to help.
<s> Um, well...
<s> Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
<s> I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
<s> I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
<s> Thank you --
<s> I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
<s> God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
<s> Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
<s> Who is she?
<s> Frances.
<s> Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
<s> Sort of.
<s> Claire?
<s> I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
<s> I gotta go now.
<s> Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
<s> We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
<s> You really want to go?
<s> Be careful, Francie.
<s> I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
<s> But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
<s> I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
<s> Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
<s> Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
<s> Fifteen.
<s> Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
<s> Then don't go to Hollywood.
<s> Harry.
<s> Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
<s> What happened to him?
<s> I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
<s> They killed him. They threw him out that window.
<s> Eight stories.
<s> Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
<s> Forget it.
<s> Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
<s> Calm down, Frances.
<s> Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
<s> For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
<s> Who said I was a lady?
<s> Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
<s> What?
<s> Whattaya think you're in now?
<s> What's that?
<s> No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
<s> Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> What'd you do?
<s> No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
<s> That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
<s> Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
<s> Your big speech?
<s> Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
<s> Go on...
<s> I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
<s> And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
<s> Thank you for understanding, Mama.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
<s> Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
<s> Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
<s> And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
<s> No!
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Her body pleases me.
<s> A brain. Extremities.
<s> I will not! Kill me now!
<s> It's been months. It's not like him.
<s> Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Nothing can. Not ever.
<s> It is
<s> It wouldn't dare.
<s> Aye, Captain.
<s> Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
<s> Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
<s> Oh God.
<s> Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
<s> Somebody has to!
<s> No. He had more important work.
<s> Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
<s> Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
<s> I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
<s> It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
<s> I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
<s> Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
<s> Are you a physician?
<s> There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
<s> You know of it?
<s> It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
<s> I will protect you.
<s> I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
<s> Un-hunh.
<s> It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
<s> It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
<s> Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
<s> Get behind him more.
<s> I'll spot you five points.
<s> God, but I love that sexy talk.
<s> We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
<s> I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
<s> Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
<s> God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
<s> Good call.
<s> Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
<s> Mmmmmmmph.
<s> Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
<s> Girls can't be cowboys.
<s> But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
<s> They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
<s> That's thirty percent.
<s> Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
<s> Yes, she is.
<s> I was a minister.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
<s> As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
<s> Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
<s> Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
<s> You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
<s> My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
<s> No!
<s> What's in Mexico?
<s> You asked me if I would --
<s> Yes.
<s> Knock yourself out.
<s> I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
<s> I wasn't scratching!
<s> Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
<s> They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
<s> Sight seein'.
<s> Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Who's "we"?
<s> Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
<s> Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
<s> Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
<s> Same rules for everyone, sir.
<s> You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
<s> I'm not sure what --
<s> Fuck me.
<s> Did you hear?
<s> I was one member of the investigating commission.
<s> Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
<s> If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
<s> Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
<s> 'Snot me.  It's him.
<s> Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
<s> Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
<s> Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
<s> I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
<s> Whose orders were those?
<s> That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
<s> I think you look beautiful.
<s> This is insane.  You've got no proof.
<s> Mighta been civilian.
<s> Smoke it!
<s> You heard me.  Move on.
<s> Should I be afraid?
<s> Show us where you are, Chief.
<s> Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
<s> Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
<s> The first female President?
<s> Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
<s> Great. See ya then.
<s> You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
<s> Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
<s> No.
<s> I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
<s> Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
<s> I got pretty close.
<s> I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
<s> Really? I'd like to find out.
<s> Oh, just some insurance guy.
<s> Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
<s> Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Not now. You got my bag?
<s> Well, I think you're cute.
<s> Get your people out of there or I will.
<s> Oh.
<s> Are you sure? How do you know?
<s> Why do you need that?
<s> Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
<s> It's Raymond.
<s> I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
<s> Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
<s> Thanks.
<s> ...Damn you!  Damn you!
<s> COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
<s> Like YOU know?
<s> Must be some sort of mining facility.
<s> Nothing.
<s> That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
<s> I had the shot...
<s> You think you could do better "Laredo?"
<s> You have a better plan, Alex?
<s> You could order something in.
<s> I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
<s> All this from watching the.. historical records?
<s> We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
<s> Excuse me guys.
<s> It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
<s> There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
<s> Okay...  Okay, now what.
<s> It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
<s> No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
<s> GO Commander.
<s> Raise the glass and push the blue button.
<s> What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
<s> Right.
<s> Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
<s> I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
<s> Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
<s> All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
<s> BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
<s> Hey, YOU want to drive?
<s> You smiled at me.
<s> One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
<s> Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
<s> It helps.
<s> Will you stop RIDING ME?!
<s> Turn on the translation circuit.
<s> Wait... Jason, Here!...
<s> Mark 12.
<s> I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
<s> Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
<s> Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
<s> This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
<s> Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
<s> I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
<s> But...Why?
<s> And determination.
<s> I think we're going to exit the space port.
<s> Why don't you just turn it on and see?
<s> It doesn't have eyes.
<s> Jason? What about me? What do I do?
<s> I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
<s> The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
<s> What does she see in them?
<s> Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
<s> Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
<s> And a French alliance?
<s> The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
<s> I?  You all know my history.
<s> Same old story.
<s> That can't be.
<s> You go too far, Benedict.
<s> Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
<s> Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
<s> Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
<s> I'll be twenty next year, sir.
<s> Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
<s> And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Lafayette is a child!
<s> Gag on your own invention, then.
<s> A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
<s> To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
<s> Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
<s> I... they look both the same.
<s> Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
<s> When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
<s> When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
<s> Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
<s> I'm with Captain Hamilton.
<s> Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
<s> Really?  Which precious homily was it?
<s> That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
<s> Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
<s> What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
<s> Who says so?
<s> Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
<s> God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
<s> You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
<s> Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
<s> I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
<s> That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
<s> I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
<s> Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
<s> You're right.
<s> Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
<s> I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
<s> Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
<s> Yeah, we're getting Martin.
<s> Who?
<s> Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
<s> You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
<s> What I been wondering is where's he been.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm in the movie business.
<s> I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
<s> That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
<s> Where you been, Harry?
<s> We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
<s> You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
<s> So you don't work for the casino?
<s> Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
<s> No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
<s> I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
<s> I found him.
<s> Who?
<s> Ask your man here.
<s> What happened? The pressure got to you?
<s> I believe it.
<s> It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
<s> How'd you know I was here?
<s> You broke in?
<s> What're you doing here?
<s> Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
<s> ...That's what we finally decided.
<s> Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
<s> Sounds fair.
<s> Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
<s> Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
<s> What happened?
<s> Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
<s> I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
<s> That's what the guy said.
<s> Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
<s> You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
<s> Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
<s> You don't? What happened to Muff?
<s> Oh, yeah, sure.
<s> Hello, Martin.
<s> 'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
<s> Thanks.
<s> North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
<s> Sixty pounds.
<s> Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
<s> No.
<s> Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
<s> Gimme a break.
<s> Right. Wednesday.
<s> It's a risk I'm willing to take.
<s> Sounds reasonable.
<s> I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
<s> What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
<s> Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
<s> Could be meant as a warning.
<s> Murphy.
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about?
<s> You smashed it!
<s> Then you're a lucky man.
<s> Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
<s> I bet you did.
<s> You're a pal.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
<s> Nothing. Let's get outa here.
<s> Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
<s> I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
<s> Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
<s> Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
<s> If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
<s> I didn't want it to turn out this way.
<s> I think I see it pretty well.
<s> He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
<s> Moving to Sweden.
<s> You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
<s> Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
<s> Not the Maxine?
<s> Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
<s> Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
<s> Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
<s> Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
<s> But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
<s> Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
<s> But I was only trying to be friendly...
<s> What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
<s> Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
<s> This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
<s> Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
<s> "Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
<s> You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
<s> I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
<s> Uh oh... don't turn around...
<s> Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
<s> You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
<s> Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
<s> You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
<s> That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
<s> Which loser?
<s> Why do I always have to do it?
<s> Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
<s> I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
<s> I'm going to tell him you said that.
<s> I dunno...
<s> Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
<s> Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
<s> It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
<s> Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
<s> Where did you get that?
<s> He does that every single day.
<s> Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
<s> That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
<s> Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
<s> I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
<s> No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
<s> What thing?
<s> Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
<s> Great...
<s> Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
<s> Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
<s> I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
<s> That's okay...
<s> I thought it wasn't for sale.
<s> I know it's over, asshole, I --
<s> That's not even --
<s> I did too!
<s> Well why do I care about that?
<s> I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
<s> Sure, I guess.
<s> Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
<s> Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
<s> You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
<s> I really didn't get a good look at her.
<s> Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
<s> These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
<s> Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
<s> Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
<s> Hooray for me.
<s> You work at Cook's Chicken?
<s> Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Really?
<s> YAAA!
<s> I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
<s> I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
<s> And you like them?
<s> Does that mean you don't like me?
<s> So, do you like me, Seymour?
<s> Do you have anything to drink?
<s> I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
<s> I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
<s> What do you want?
<s> ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
<s> Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
<s> I wish I could see him.
<s> I am.
<s> It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
<s> I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
<s> Right, exactly!
<s> I don't know... where is she, then?
<s> That slut!
<s> -malaria epidemic; very sudden.
<s> Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
<s> Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
<s> Then why do you stay?
<s> We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
<s> The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
<s> Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
<s> Have you got that in writing? 
<s> No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
<s> Have you ever failed?
<s> It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
<s> But of course yours worked.
<s> You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
<s> Why?
<s> The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
<s> Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
<s> Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
<s> Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
<s> Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
<s> I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
<s> Certainly.
<s> I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
<s> You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
<s> We definitely had a moment or two.
<s> No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
<s> Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
<s> Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
<s> Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
<s> Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
<s> Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
<s> I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
<s> Tonight?
<s> Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
<s> Who are they?
<s> You've got to stop them.  Please!
<s> Do I?
<s> Get on with it, counselor!
<s> Like what?
<s> Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
<s> Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
<s> Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
<s> No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
<s> Do it!  Just do it!
<s> There's something very familiar about this painting.
<s> Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
<s> Okay, let's heat 'em up!
<s> No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
<s> I'll get one more reading.
<s> Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
<s> Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
<s> We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
<s> Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
<s> Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
<s> It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
<s> Huh?  What?
<s> Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
<s> Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
<s> I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
<s> It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
<s> Are you sick, Louis?
<s> Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
<s> Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
<s> Thanks.  What's in there?
<s> What?
<s> All right.
<s> Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
<s> No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
<s> Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
<s> Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
<s> Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
<s> I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
<s> Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
<s> I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
<s> I don't believe in luck.
<s> Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
<s> No, you may not.
<s> Why do you want to see it?
<s> Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
<s> On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
<s> She said he was "the Destructor."
<s> Gozer.
<s> Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
<s> Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
<s> You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
<s> To go into business for ourselves.
<s> It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
<s> No sense worrying about it now.
<s> Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
<s> Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
<s> Mmmhmmm.
<s> I'm sure, I don't know.
<s> You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
<s> Yes?  Go on!
<s> You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
<s> Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
<s> The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
<s> They won't break this one.
<s> At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
<s> I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
<s> But have never been?
<s> When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
<s> Sneaking around with your brother?
<s> I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
<s> Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
<s> Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
<s> Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
<s> You teach them!
<s> You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
<s> I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
<s> Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
<s> What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
<s> A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
<s> Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
<s> Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No -- why should I?
<s> No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
<s> I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
<s> Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
<s> Of course not.
<s> I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
<s> Because I want to know what's happening.
<s> GET OUT!
<s> Come in.
<s> All right then! Yes!
<s> Because it isn't true.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
<s> Ahhh.
<s> I am going to call the police now.
<s> Could you bring it up?
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
<s> No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
<s> What?
<s> It's in the main ballroom.
<s> A single. Just for myself, please.
<s> What?
<s> Oh no.
<s> I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
<s> Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
<s> What for?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
<s> What?
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
<s> Well I don't know.
<s> Sit down.
<s> Right.
<s> I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
<s> Would you like me to seduce you?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Very well. Thank you.
<s> Waiter!
<s> I haven't. No.
<s> Now?
<s> That's fine.
<s> I'll be up in five minutes.
<s> The number.
<s> What?
<s> Who said it was my first time?
<s> Are you tired of it?
<s> Well what do you want to talk about?
<s> What one.
<s> There's no risk?
<s> He's asleep.
<s> Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
<s> Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
<s> The driveway's on my side of the house.
<s> We've talked enough, Benjamin.
<s> I don't.
<s> All right. Now let's get to bed.
<s> That's enough.
<s> Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
<s> If that's how you feel --
<s> Then you'd better start believing me.
<s> Sure.
<s> Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
<s> Goodnight, Benjamin.
<s> No -- they don't.
<s> -- worried?
<s> No.
<s> That's a hell of a good age to be.
<s> How long have we known each other now?
<s> Quite a while.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> It was nothing to do with you, sir.
<s> Don't shout at me, Ben.
<s> Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
<s> Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
<s> Why?
<s> Who?
<s> Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
<s> Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
<s> Free --
<s> Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
<s> Sorry.
<s> I feel sorry for him.
<s> And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
<s> What do you want here?
<s> Why do you hide in my room?
<s> I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
<s> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
<s> Am I quite strange to you?
<s> You are beautiful!
<s> What?
<s> Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
<s> Not at all, sir. 
<s> Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
<s> Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
<s> Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
<s> Insolent -- Berlin manners.
<s> Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
<s> No, doctor.
<s> You're tired. I can see that.
<s> Everything?
<s> Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
<s> I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
<s> Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
<s> I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
<s> I didn't like Preysing right off.
<s> Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
<s> Moreover...
<s> Definitely off.
<s> A thousand marks -- 
<s> Shhh -- here he is now.
<s> All you have to do is phone for it.
<s> Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
<s> Then, it's all over?
<s> Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
<s> Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
<s> He likes to play the great man.
<s> Send it away -- I shan't need it.
<s> I wish to be alone.
<s> Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
<s> I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
<s> Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
<s> Well -- gentlemen.
<s> Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
<s> Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
<s> I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
<s> My son --
<s> You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
<s> Roy? He's always crying.
<s> Hah.
<s> Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
<s> Henry, no!
<s> We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
<s> I know.
<s> But they must be! They cut glass!
<s> Hello.
<s> Roy Dillon.
<s> That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
<s> Lead on.
<s> Just myself.
<s> I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
<s> Perk.
<s> I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
<s> I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
<s> Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
<s> Somewhere else, that's for sure.
<s> Never.
<s> And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
<s> Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
<s> I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
<s> You're too young. You should be in school.
<s> I'm a salesman.
<s> Yeah? How?
<s> What happened to Cole?
<s> Open your door.
<s> I went out to Delmar.
<s> You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
<s> No! Because I --
<s> I'm happy the way I am.
<s> My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
<s> Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
<s> Oh, yeah. That's that.
<s> Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
<s> It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
<s> The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
<s> Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
<s> Would somebody shut this guy up?
<s> No shit.
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
<s> To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
<s> I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
<s> Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
<s> Please, get on the bus...
<s> You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
<s> It's always John.
<s> A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> What is it?
<s> Can't you hold it?
<s> We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
<s> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
<s> Guess so ...
<s> But I've seen him!
<s> Relax, John.  They were just kids.
<s> A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
<s> What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
<s> Jamie?  But I thought she was --
<s> It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
<s> Here.  Let me try.
<s> It's a rune ... Thorn.
<s> I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
<s> You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
<s> An old friend.
<s> Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
<s> Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
<s> No!!!
<s> I dunno, boy.
<s> Didn't recognize you.
<s> Let's talk about it some other time.
<s> Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
<s> Go home!
<s> First Nagasaki--now this.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
<s> The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
<s> Tit for tat--as simple as that.
<s> You did?
<s> Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
<s> Out!  Out!
<s> She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
<s> He worships Father.
<s> She met him at college.
<s> Tell me some true stories about Dad.
<s> Tell me that!  Tell me that!
<s> Scat!
<s> Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
<s> Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
<s> It's your house, Dad.
<s> Heaven.
<s> I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
<s> Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
<s> How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
<s> Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
<s> We thought a doctor might help.
<s> We thought it was an emergency.
<s> A trip, you mean?
<s> You're wrong.
<s> Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
<s> He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
<s> More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
<s> He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
<s> Sounds quite beautiful.
<s> Like what?
<s> I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
<s> Stop!
<s> There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
<s> Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
<s> And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
<s> I've got to run!
<s> I've literally got to run!
<s> I was going to ask.
<s> This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
<s> Lest we forget how cruel you are.
<s> We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
<s> And terror, if you don't mind.
<s> Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
<s> Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
<s> I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
<s> You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
<s> No!
<s> I've enjoyed being man.
<s> So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
<s> My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
<s> Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
<s> I heard you were looking for me.
<s> Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
<s> Ja?
<s> Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
<s> Stay home tonight!
<s> If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
<s> To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
<s> It is you, isn't it, Harold?
<s> He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
<s> Tonight's the night.
<s> Meaning?
<s> We met here earlier this evening.
<s> Yes, we do.
<s> We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
<s> Mozart plays shuffleboard.
<s> Do you have any particular choice of girl?
<s> You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
<s> Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
<s> I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
<s> What girls you got here?
<s> Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
<s> Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
<s> Um-hm. Live sound.
<s> Ulcers.
<s> You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
<s> No.
<s> Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
<s> T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
<s> Fuck.
<s> If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
<s> Do you live in a house back in wherever.
<s> What makes you so sure?
<s> Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
<s> Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
<s> Mr. Van Dorn?
<s> Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
<s> Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
<s> I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
<s> I just heard. Who is he?
<s> Does she know anything about this?
<s> Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
<s> I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
<s> Rucker.
<s> I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
<s> Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
<s> Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
<s> You ever play Chicken?
<s> I'm worried about Jake.
<s> I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
<s> No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
<s> Possession of a stolen shovel.
<s> Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
<s> Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
<s> Then whose name is it registered in?
<s> Lady! Be quiet.
<s> I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
<s> Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
<s> Your hearse?
<s> Well, then, you must come back and visit.
<s> My door is always open.
<s> Maude???!
<s> Eh, fine.
<s> That's really great.
<s> Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Because they are all the same.
<s> Over there by the courthouse.
<s> Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
<s> It's all right.  It's organic.
<s> Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
<s> Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
<s> Well, why don't you?
<s> Yes. They're old friends.
<s> Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
<s> You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
<s> Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
<s> Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
<s> Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
<s> What about the draft?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'd have liked to talk to him.
<s> War is not all black.
<s> Oh sure.
<s> Souvenirs?
<s> Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
<s> She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
<s> Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
<s> Julia.
<s> Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
<s> She certainly has.
<s> What?
<s> So you slept O.K.?
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> WHY?
<s> What are you talking...
<s> No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
<s> Didn't even buy me a drink.
<s> What is it?
<s> "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
<s> 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
<s> Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
<s> I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
<s> We're on the move.
<s> Grounded? Who's grounded?
<s> Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
<s> I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
<s> Don't move. We --
<s> No. Don't --
<s> You never, ever light a cigar that way.
<s> Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
<s> Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
<s> 60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
<s> Doesn't sounds like him.
<s> Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
<s> -- Section fifty-one. Step back.
<s> Julia's my second wife.
<s> Who are you?
<s> HE did. I've seen him.
<s> Stay the fuck away from me.
<s> First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
<s> Oh Christ.
<s> Kirsty?
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> You're hurting.
<s> Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
<s> What?
<s> You're still afraid.
<s> Yes. They'll never find us.
<s> I said no.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
<s> Which is where?
<s> Where's Daddy?
<s> I was here this afternoon.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> We're going to freeze to death.
<s> I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
<s> I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
<s> Shit.
<s> Just feeling a bit sick.
<s> You want something to drink?
<s> Do you care ?
<s> We don't need a bed, do we?
<s> Steve.
<s> I said: I found a room.
<s> What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
<s> Sure.
<s> Really?
<s> Sure.
<s> Of course.
<s> Finished?
<s> I want to see.
<s> No. It's all over.
<s> I have to get out.
<s> We walk.
<s> Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
<s> Sure. Why not?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
<s> Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
<s> That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
<s> Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
<s> Suck my ass.
<s> What band?
<s> How many tickets can I put you down for?
<s> Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
<s> No way.
<s> That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
<s> Do not get ahead of yourself.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
<s> You can be and are wrong.
<s> Nobody.
<s> Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
<s> What do you mean, four more?
<s> Yeah, sure...
<s> Uh...yes, at the moment.
<s> There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
<s> The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
<s> I understand, Dick.
<s> I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
<s> You look upset.
<s> Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
<s> We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
<s> I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
<s> What, what?
<s> Nevermind.
<s> Just ask it!
<s> You really think it would make a difference either way?
<s> I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
<s> I don't have your number.
<s> I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
<s> It was kind of funny.
<s> I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
<s> I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
<s> I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
<s> C'mon.
<s> You're being stupid.
<s> Hi.  What are you doing?
<s> WHAT?
<s> And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
<s> That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
<s> I mean it.
<s> Not in love, exactly, but...
<s> I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
<s> Enough of what?
<s> Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
<s> Yup.
<s> Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
<s> Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
<s> I'm sure it isn't.
<s> Oh, right.  Alright.
<s> Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
<s> Everything all right?
<s> Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
<s> I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
<s> And I won't take a penny over ninety.
<s> Records are those big round black things, right?
<s> I'm Vince.
<s> Nice.
<s> There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
<s> Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
<s> -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
<s> Probably.
<s> I've been to Church Hill.
<s> Not your concern.
<s> Have you gone to the police?
<s> You are.  Now.
<s> Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
<s> There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Follow me.
<s> Of bodies.
<s> You killed those other two.
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> Spare me the details.
<s> It'll never stick.
<s> What's all of this got to do with me?
<s> It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
<s> You'll not be bringing the church into this.
<s> -Auditorium nostrum-
<s> Please go to no trouble.
<s> Yes.  Always.
<s> Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
<s> You are still so very young.
<s> What?
<s> It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
<s> We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
<s> Muy Bien!
<s> I have no future husband.
<s> What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
<s> But I did live.
<s> Who?
<s> You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
<s> Mulet.
<s> Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
<s> I had no choice.
<s> Your father must be smart.
<s> You'd think he'd had practice.
<s> Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
<s> He knows I'm here.  How?
<s> Sit.
<s> How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> He always did.
<s> Not so long.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Do you?
<s> I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
<s> The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
<s> When may I expect the cleaners?
<s> I'm getting married tomorrow.
<s> The poem?... The poem was great!
<s> My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
<s> I'll come a-running, pardner.
<s> He certainly -- hic -- does!
<s> Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
<s> Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
<s> The Criminal Courts Building.
<s> We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
<s> Where'd she go?
<s> Fine.
<s> No. My mother.
<s> That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
<s> If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
<s> And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
<s> Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
<s> You bet I've got a better offer.
<s> I know, Walter, but I --
<s> Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
<s> You -- you --
<s> That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
<s> Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
<s> Now you got me.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
<s> Thank you.
<s> Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
<s> Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
<s> What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
<s> Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
<s> Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
<s> I get it!
<s> You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
<s> Okay, Walter. 
<s> You been in a fight?
<s> Louie!
<s> Was she? Did you notice?
<s> I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
<s> Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
<s> That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
<s> Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
<s> Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
<s> Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
<s> Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
<s> Thanks.
<s> No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
<s> On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
<s> You -- you!!
<s> Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
<s> Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
<s> Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
<s> Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
<s> Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
<s> Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
<s> Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
<s> I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
<s> Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
<s> Three sixes. Is that any good?
<s> Little rum in yours, too?
<s> Good coffee, isn't it?
<s> Hold her, boys!
<s> What do I know about Williams?
<s> The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
<s> Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
<s> Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
<s> And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
<s> An attempt to ruin us!
<s> Now what do you say?
<s> Editorials?
<s> Phone for you, Hildy.
<s> I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
<s> Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
<s> I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
<s> That's good.
<s> Mother!
<s> Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
<s> Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
<s> We'll get you out in ten minutes.
<s> Ssh!
<s> Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
<s> The what?
<s> I'll explain it tomorrow!
<s> A very fine-looking women.
<s> His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
<s> She and Mollie were talking.
<s> With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
<s> You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<s> Looking for shrapnel.
<s> Yes, you was. Make him talk.
<s> Who told you that?
<s> He's the worst liar.
<s> I'm starting my own collection.
<s> You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
<s> Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
<s> I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
<s> If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
<s> Naturally.
<s> That's it.
<s> Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
<s> Who said anything about love?
<s> He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
<s> Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
<s> Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
<s> ...since I used to take you to the Proms?
<s> Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
<s> And now we're glad you did.
<s> Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
<s> Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
<s> Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
<s> Where's that?
<s> You sure do a lot of guessing.
<s> A dead one.
<s> Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
<s> Are you two gals all funny with each other?
<s> I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
<s> I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
<s> Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
<s> Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
<s> Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
<s> Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
<s> How much further?
<s> What's that?
<s> Way out here?
<s> Man, it's already ten thirty.
<s> It's a girl.
<s> Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
<s> What?
<s> I gotta open the gate.
<s> And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
<s> The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
<s> It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
<s> I don't know, I think he's funny.
<s> Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
<s> She looks like she stinks.
<s> Yeah, she said we looked queer.
<s> What? I didn't hear anything.
<s> Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
<s> Not yet.
<s> Keys.
<s> Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
<s> My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
<s> I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
<s> What! God damn, how many?
<s> Where we headed?
<s> Right.
<s> That must be him.
<s> Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
<s> French?
<s> Oui, doctor, oui.
<s> Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
<s> Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
<s> Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
<s> I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
<s> No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
<s> I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
<s> Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
<s> But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
<s> Okay.
<s> Very well.
<s> I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
<s> Won't he be able to tell?
<s> He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
<s> Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
<s> Three foot one.
<s> Nathan told my brother.
<s> Where?
<s> That's not necessarily a bad thing.
<s> Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
<s> You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
<s> Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
<s> Yes, and...
<s> Nathan!
<s> I don't think so.  Why?
<s> It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
<s> Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
<s> Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
<s> Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
<s> I guess.
<s> Have you?
<s> Such as what womanly things?
<s> That was wonderful!
<s> Should I come with?
<s> Yes.
<s> Ugnh.
<s> Ooka.
<s> Yahoo!
<s> Got it.
<s> Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
<s> Ounpoo. Ungh.
<s> Soon as I finish my coffee.
<s> That's right, Miss Packard.
<s> Do we need words?
<s> You know what's good for him?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
<s> Cash.
<s> Cut.
<s> Thought you only drank milk.
<s> What is?
<s> So I got talent. So what beat me?
<s> Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
<s> So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
<s> Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
<s> I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
<s> You know everybody, don't you?
<s> I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
<s> Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
<s> It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
<s> Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
<s> I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
<s> No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
<s> Aaaahhhh!
<s> Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
<s> Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
<s> If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
<s> Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
<s> I told you you'd get your money back.
<s> Yeah. Sure.
<s> A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
<s> Call it.
<s> Eight o'clock.
<s> I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
<s> I drink.
<s> What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
<s> I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
<s> Okay. So what's your name today?
<s> At school. It's Thursday.
<s> Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
<s> Thanks.
<s> When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
<s> Haven't you opened it?
<s> What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
<s> You wanna drink?
<s> What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
<s> Is that what makes a winner?
<s> Nothin'.  Want another drink?
<s> I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
<s> Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
<s> That's right.
<s> Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Yes.
<s> With them?
<s> What?
<s> You're not them.
<s> You got that right.
<s> I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
<s> Do we have to?
<s> I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
<s> That's the Air Force Base.
<s> This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
<s> Okay.
<s> You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
<s> I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
<s> I left it at work.
<s> Good night.
<s> Yes, Mr. Gardner.
<s> Why, yes.  Why?
<s> You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
<s> Behind my house, up on the ridge.
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
<s> The back door was open.
<s> What?
<s> This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
<s> I take it you've heard.
<s> Did it work?
<s> Think nothing of it, Spanky.
<s> All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
<s> We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
<s> And the good news is you won't charge me.
<s> ...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
<s> Can you believe this?
<s> Haven't you been watching?
<s> What happened?
<s> I'm thinking.
<s> They don't know this.
<s> Dad...
<s> She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
<s> He wasn't the President then.
<s> I'm making a mess.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
<s> I can't shake her free.
<s> Doesn't matter. Game's over.
<s> She should be shortly.
<s> Then find them.
<s> I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
<s> Roger.
<s> They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
<s> Yeah, but what an entrance!
<s> How to kiss ass.
<s> Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
<s> I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
<s> Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
<s> You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
<s> For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Papers, sir. Got it here.
<s> All your life.
<s> Yes. My treat.
<s> I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
<s> Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
<s> It looks like a converted church.
<s> Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
<s> It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
<s> Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
<s> I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
<s> I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
<s> As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
<s> In that case, I permit you.
<s> Find something?
<s> Where is it? I want it.
<s> Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
<s> All I have to do is scream.
<s> I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
<s> Then wait -- count to twenty.
<s> And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
<s> Don't worry -- I'm fine.
<s> He was actually there? You saw him?
<s> I came here to save you.
<s> What?
<s> Booby traps?
<s> But what are they? Can't you remember?
<s> Hmmm... What did we talk about?
<s> I don't know. We'll find out.
<s> Junior?! Dad...
<s> My name is Kazim.
<s> I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
<s> Something magical. A sacred rock.
<s> Miss Scott panicked?
<s> No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
<s> It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
<s> Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
<s> Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
<s> That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
<s> You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
<s> Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
<s> Siam.
<s> He told me they knew I was coming here.
<s> It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
<s> What?!
<s> PET IT??!!
<s> You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
<s> She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
<s> I'm not leaving without those stones.
<s> You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
<s> You got it!
<s> I know you did!
<s> I'm...inside you.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Right.
<s> You said it.
<s> Then I'm crazy.
<s> Just scratched my arm, why?
<s> The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
<s> I'm at the airport.
<s> What about it?
<s> Why not?
<s> Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
<s> Just get there.
<s> What is it?
<s> Eat it.
<s> For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
<s> What? What do you mean?
<s> Wait.
<s> Where are you staying?
<s> Rene...
<s> But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
<s> Just hold them close and stay still.
<s> She's the toughest to read.
<s> Follow her.
<s> I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
<s> Just say the words. Just like I told you.
<s> Well...?
<s> ...Shit! It's just money.
<s> And don't let her know, either.
<s> Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
<s> Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
<s> What exactly?
<s> Where've you been?
<s> We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
<s> About what?
<s> You've changed your mind.
<s> I'll get us out of here.
<s> Oh, I can't.
<s> I insist.
<s> Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
<s> I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
<s> We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
<s> Surveilliance on them all.
<s> He work for us?
<s> I have a new client.
<s> Here?
<s> What?
<s> Oh yeah, thanks...
<s> The little man in my...  ...head...
<s> Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
<s> You...him...UST.
<s> Thanks, I appreciate that.
<s> Sir?
<s> We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
<s> I didn't say anything.
<s> Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
<s> You talk to yourself.
<s> How often they come here?
<s> They left. I had to go with them.
<s> You seemed interesting.
<s> You did.
<s> What'd he steal?
<s> One chip?
<s> Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
<s> He plays it all the time.
<s> Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
<s> He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
<s> That I really don't know.
<s> Why?
<s> Why not, what are you going to do?
<s> I'll come back for you.
<s> You're gonna laugh.
<s> ...Piece of mind.
<s> A drink...
<s> Yes.
<s> Perfectly.
<s> It'l be alright.
<s> It doesn't hurt.
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> What does he know?
<s> So we better get started.
<s> Okay.
<s> In the backyard.
<s> You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
<s> Monday.
<s> Yeah. Catch you later.
<s> Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
<s> Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
<s> Maybe later.
<s> Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
<s> No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
<s> So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
<s> I'm not touching my film...
<s> Before you go...
<s> No, no, we're fine...
<s> How grave?
<s> Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
<s> Did I tell you you were wrong?
<s> Soy sauce...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> What's the difference...
<s> "60 Minutes," the television show?
<s> It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
<s> ...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
<s> Jeffrey...
<s> ...you fucked me!
<s> Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
<s> Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
<s> But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
<s> Everything interests me.
<s> Yeah... Thank you.
<s> If you want to do it.
<s> Jump in, quick, c'mon...
<s> How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
<s> Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
<s> ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
<s> ...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
<s> A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
<s> Well, what do you really think, though?
<s> Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
<s> Where you staying now?
<s> Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
<s> We'd better go before we get thrown out.
<s> I had no idea until after, but --
<s> A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
<s> Sustained.
<s> I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
<s> The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
<s> Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
<s> What do you mean, was.
<s> Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
<s> Ruth Rabino.
<s> I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> And you must be Mr. Massey.
<s> But why him?
<s> Have you tried the duck?
<s> Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
<s> I know.
<s> I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
<s> Miles.
<s> I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
<s> On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
<s> I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
<s> Meaning my house.
<s> Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
<s> That's true.
<s> I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
<s> Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
<s> Marylin?
<s> You used his credit card.
<s> He was right, wasn't he?
<s> In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> When you have a moment.
<s> Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
<s> I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
<s> Well -- is that possible?
<s> Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
<s> The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
<s> Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
<s> You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
<s> I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
<s> Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
<s> Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
<s> Yeah.
<s> In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
<s> I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
<s> That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
<s> On the road.
<s> No.
<s> He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
<s> He's marvelous!
<s> It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
<s> Oh, please, Dad
<s> Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
<s> It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
<s> Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> But it's King Westley on the phone.
<s> What happened to your money?
<s> Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
<s> If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
<s> Huh?
<s> Ohthe papers
<s> Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
<s> Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
<s> You're not really serious about this, are you?
<s> Like this. I have no robe.
<s> Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
<s> Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
<s> You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
<s> Why, haven't you?
<s> Yes.
<s> And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
<s> Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
<s> What?
<s> Doesn't sound very exciting.
<s> Raw?
<s> No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
<s> What if nobody stops for us?
<s> You figured that all out yourself, huh?
<s> Come onget in.
<s> Darling!
<s> I'm out! I'm out!
<s> Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
<s> I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
<s> When does the bus leave?
<s> You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
<s> How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
<s> What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
<s> Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
<s> That she's going to marry somebody else.
<s> Well, I got it, Joe.
<s> Well, I'll be
<s> Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hey, you!
<s> There's a seat over there for you.
<s> Thanks. 
<s> Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
<s> "Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
<s> You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
<s> What's the other name?
<s> So why does he call himself Bertrand?
<s> The anonymous kind, Chief.
<s> Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
<s> When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
<s> There's a word - orders.
<s> Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
<s> Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
<s> No, I did not.
<s> What did they...
<s> They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
<s> How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
<s> I see.  And where did you drive?
<s> Why Galveston?
<s> I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
<s> Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
<s> There were admirals.
<s> What?
<s> Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
<s> So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
<s> That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
<s> Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
<s> Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
<s> I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
<s> We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
<s> A Perry Russo?
<s> David Ferrie.
<s> It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
<s> It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
<s> But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
<s> Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
<s> I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
<s> Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
<s> Well... yeah.
<s> Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
<s> Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
<s> He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
<s> We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
<s> Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
<s> Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
<s> I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
<s> If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
<s> Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
<s> I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
<s> If you buy what you read in the paper.
<s> Was he there often?
<s> Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
<s> Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
<s> Germany.
<s> Virginia.
<s> Six.
<s> Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
<s> I understand.
<s> Who was there for your ass?
<s> If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
<s> Let me finish. Can I finish?
<s> I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
<s> Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
<s> This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
<s> What's in it?
<s> 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
<s> Okay.
<s> In cash.
<s> It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
<s> I thought you might want a drink?
<s> Why does it need to be dark?
<s> Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
<s> Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
<s> I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
<s> That's him. How do you know 'em?
<s> Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
<s> I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
<s> Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
<s> You went out this morning and bought a gun.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It looks nice.
<s> '74, I think.
<s> Are you?
<s> Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
<s> He called you?
<s> If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
<s> It's not really something I think about.
<s> I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
<s> Oh, are you? Does she know that?
<s> For now. These relationships never last too long.
<s> I'm old enough to be her father.
<s> They seem to like the idea.
<s> Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
<s> No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
<s> What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
<s> A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
<s> That's my job.
<s> Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
<s> Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
<s> Tell him you want to see him?
<s> I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
<s> Spain.
<s> Thanks, but you have a good time.
<s> You know what's in the bag you're taking?
<s> I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
<s> I thought you were going to let this one through.
<s> I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
<s> I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
<s> I thought you were watching him.
<s> What about me?
<s> Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
<s> I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
<s> Yeah, do you like it?
<s> Who you think got your ass outta jail?
<s> I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
<s> One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
<s> Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
<s> I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
<s> I told them.
<s> Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
<s> I'll give ya ten.
<s> Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
<s> Designer clothes.
<s> The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
<s> Where you gonna be during all this?
<s> Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
<s> We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
<s> Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
<s> Four days ago.
<s> Two months shy of four years.
<s> Bank robbery.
<s> Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
<s> Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
<s> I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
<s> You live with him.
<s> What's your cost?
<s> That's good money.
<s> What do I do?
<s> Okay.
<s> Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
<s> But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
<s> Well, why the fuck keep her around?
<s> Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
<s> Twice. In the parking lot.
<s> The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
<s> That's right.
<s> If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
<s> Cops can't locate him, huh?
<s> It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
<s> Gonna have to put up cash.
<s> Cost you a thousand for the bond.
<s> You don't say.
<s> Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
<s> Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
<s> If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
<s> I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
<s> She got off, huh?
<s> That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
<s> My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
<s> Call her, tell her the combination.
<s> I call your office, she better answer the phone.
<s> It's Beaumont.
<s> Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
<s> There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
<s> No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
<s> Della?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Yeah, ever since that ...
<s> Me, too.
<s> Oh, terrific.
<s> Maybe the demons are real.
<s> I'm hanging up.
<s> What the hell is that supposed to mean?
<s> ... I've seen them, too.
<s> We should get ourselves a lawyer.
<s> Her knee acting up?
<s> What did she have to say?
<s> Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
<s> Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
<s> Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
<s> I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
<s> Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
<s> Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
<s> No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
<s> I don't let anybody call me that.
<s> The best.
<s> I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
<s> It's gone to the top.
<s> Sam, Tony, come in here.
<s> With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
<s> You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
<s> Why didn't you call me?
<s> I don't believe this.
<s> Stay away from me, Jez.
<s> You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
<s> A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
<s> I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
<s> I love you when you're angry.
<s> YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
<s> Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
<s> Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
<s> I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
<s> The Ladder?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well that's good to know.
<s> Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
<s> I no from around here.
<s> If you're lucky.
<s> Push 'em back.
<s> That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
<s> That's a lie. My family was here.
<s> Jacob Singer?
<s> Nope.
<s> You've seen them?
<s> I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
<s> Pause play.
<s> No.
<s> We made it?
<s> Done?
<s> Delongpre! Out of time!
<s> Get out of here!
<s> Where'd you get the gun?
<s> I'm coming, I'm coming.
<s> What are you doing back?!!
<s> Thorgan, suit up.
<s> Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
<s> Oh man, what the hell happened?
<s> Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
<s> Med-kit?
<s> 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
<s> It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
<s> I thought you meant...
<s> You?
<s> Oh sure, all the time.
<s> That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
<s> I get it.
<s> No shit. I got no problem with that.
<s> I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
<s> I'm on my way.
<s> Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
<s> Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
<s> Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
<s> So what else is new?
<s> Maybe she tripped.
<s> Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
<s> Defense droids. I'm on it.
<s> He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
<s> If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
<s> See you then . . . doctor.
<s> Obviously so.
<s> My boat's neat, dad!
<s> Here --  Take him home.
<s> You got it.
<s> Two cases. And dinner when you land.
<s> What do you mean 'We...?'
<s> Who's driving the boat?
<s> ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
<s> Michael! Come inside!
<s> Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
<s> You going to be all right?
<s> I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
<s> What'll I tell the kids?
<s> All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
<s> I didn't agree to that!
<s> Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
<s> No, we just checked the beach...
<s> You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
<s> Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
<s> Chum?
<s> I want to check something. Hold my feet.
<s> Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
<s> Twenty years.
<s> Do I set the goddam hook?
<s> I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
<s> This is Quint, Missus.
<s> I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
<s> It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
<s> Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
<s> And I'll drink to yours.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Cool.
<s> I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
<s> Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
<s> The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
<s> Huh?
<s> Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, hey Vijay.
<s> Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
<s> I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
<s> They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
<s> Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
<s> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
<s> I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
<s> Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
<s> I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
<s> You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
<s> Hey, I like this.
<s> Here's to dovetailing interests.
<s> Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
<s> You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
<s> I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
<s> Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
<s> What?
<s> God, you're so young.
<s> Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
<s> Room with a toilet, got it.
<s> Oh really?
<s> Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
<s> Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
<s> Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
<s> Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
<s> Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
<s> Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
<s> Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
<s> Either I just pissed my pants or...
<s> Thundercats are go!
<s> Dude, I'm pregnant.
<s> I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
<s> It was magnificent, man!
<s> Yeah, but it sucks for free.
<s> Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
<s> No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
<s> Or stage parents!
<s> Well, you are kind of... convex.
<s> Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
<s> There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
<s> Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
<s> You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
<s> Are you looking for any other compensation?
<s> Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
<s> I suppose anything's possible.
<s> ...Yeah.
<s> Do what?
<s> That's not true!
<s> Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
<s> Early, you are so sweet.
<s> Best kind.
<s> Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to...
<s> It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
<s> Dahlia, no.
<s> I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
<s> Ain't you goin' to record it?
<s> If you say so.
<s> Thank god!
<s> Lighten up...
<s> Bitch, bitch, bitch!
<s> Fuck!
<s> I don't know.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Shut your mouth.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
<s> Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
<s> You fucked it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
<s> She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right.
<s> No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
<s> I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
<s> Good luck?
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
<s> Na.
<s> Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
<s> Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
<s> Right now?
<s> At the block party?
<s> Yes.
<s> I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
<s> Nothing?
<s> I don't want you to hurt me.
<s> I tested positive?
<s> But I only had sex with Telly.
<s> What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
<s> Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
<s> It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
<s> Foreplay. Foreplay.
<s> Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
<s> Because he can like climax you up to that...
<s> And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
<s> It's me. Telly.
<s> Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
<s> He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
<s> Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
<s> Get off me!
<s> You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
<s> I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
<s> That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
<s> Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
<s> Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
<s> I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
<s> I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
<s> Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
<s> She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
<s> They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
<s> You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
<s> How do you know that?  Did he say something?
<s> That has nothing to do with it.
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
<s> Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
<s> No Frank.  No prints.
<s> We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
<s> It's important.
<s> But we heard him.
<s> Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
<s> That's a big area to cover.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
<s> Ten days ago.
<s> She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
<s> I got it from the tournament directory.
<s> That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
<s> Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
<s> How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
<s> A building?
<s> Are we going to go through this again?
<s> It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
<s> I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
<s> Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
<s> It's alright.
<s> Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
<s> Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
<s> Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
<s> How could you?  Unless you were there.
<s> No.  But I'm open to distractions.
<s> You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
<s> What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
<s> No.
<s> Call room service.
<s> I thought you said the line was busy?
<s> It's not that easy.
<s> But I do.
<s> Why not?
<s> I got lucky.
<s> Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
<s> Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
<s> I don't know how.
<s> Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
<s> Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
<s> What do you see?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
<s> You will tell me her name and we will go together.
<s> I chose the wrong passage.
<s> No! You cannot know that!
<s> I forbid you!
<s> I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
<s> You have done it?
<s> Saddles.
<s> Yes.
<s> He saved our lives.
<s> Hah! You don't know me, boy.
<s> So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
<s> Subject to the King, no doubt.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
<s> It's right behind you.
<s> We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
<s> That I am, my lady.
<s> A match for your son, I think.
<s> They will have the life that you and I might have had.
<s> Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
<s> The Widow of the Web?
<s> She has the power to kill.
<s> It's a hundred leagues from here.
<s> Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
<s> That is true.
<s> Why must you know?
<s> Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
<s> You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
<s> No?
<s> No.
<s> Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
<s> I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
<s> What shall we do?
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
<s> Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
<s> Fine...
<s> ...And how much is it?
<s> I know... But I'm a little pressed.
<s> Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
<s> Yes... Twice.
<s> No...
<s> I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
<s> I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
<s> You have?
<s> There was no card.
<s> It's just a regular day.
<s> Yes.
<s> You're talking to me?
<s> It'll make it.
<s> I think it's a different place for each person.
<s> Good.
<s> I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
<s> Pacifica, California.
<s> Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
<s> And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
<s> You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
<s> You tell stories?
<s> Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
<s> Walking where?
<s> I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
<s> She knew you loved her.
<s> I do.
<s> Evening News?
<s> It's yours.
<s> This isn't right.
<s> What are my choices?
<s> No.
<s> Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
<s> A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
<s> I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
<s> I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
<s> I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
<s> OK.
<s> I know that...
<s> Whatever that means. Open your presents.
<s> OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
<s> Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
<s> Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
<s> Yes... I guess I knew that.
<s> Yes.
<s> Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
<s> Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
<s> It's me, Yuri.
<s> I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
<s> Are we done for today?
<s> He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
<s> He's an ass that's gonna try.
<s> Whatever it is -- it could save you.
<s> How?
<s> Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
<s> No. I was in the shower.
<s> Yes.
<s> Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
<s> Who's askin'?
<s> Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
<s> Aristotle.
<s> Definitely! I love him!
<s> Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
<s> Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
<s> What?
<s> Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
<s> So?
<s> But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
<s> No way --
<s> I will...
<s> I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
<s> Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
<s> No, she can't move for an hour.
<s> I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
<s> That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
<s> The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
<s> Are you asking me on a date?
<s> Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
<s> What happened?
<s> Where's Warner?
<s> My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
<s> That's why I think it's time for us to --
<s> I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
<s> Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
<s> Thank you. Having fun?
<s> I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
<s> But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
<s> I gave her my word, Warner.
<s> I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
<s> I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
<s> Where's the Rock?
<s> You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
<s> Not from me, surely...
<s> We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
<s> I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
<s> And then?
<s> Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
<s> And, now?
<s> Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
<s> We be honored, friend Ogg.
<s> Faerie ring?
<s> And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
<s> What does she want from me?
<s> If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
<s> Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
<s> Whatever for?
<s> Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
<s> Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
<s> Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
<s> Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
<s> Willful creature, that one...
<s> Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
<s> It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
<s> It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
<s> Been telling you that all along, lad.
<s> I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
<s> Did you bring me here to sup?
<s> Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
<s> Sapphire!
<s> Where?
<s> That's it then... the ring!
<s> These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
<s> Gonna make ogre-stew!
<s> Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
<s> They'll do nicely.
<s> Never.
<s> All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
<s> Be patient.
<s> Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
<s> Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
<s> Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
<s> You've freed me, Jack...
<s> In the dark... where I join him...
<s> Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
<s> You're teasing still.
<s> Pinching me!
<s> Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
<s> Thought the weather terrible of late.
<s> His feet shall never cross my lips.
<s> Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
<s> She's dead!
<s> What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
<s> No fear of that now.
<s> Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
<s> Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
<s> I think she's about to foal.
<s> No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
<s> Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
<s> Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
<s> That very nice.
<s> I love red!  That's my favorite color!
<s> And why was the alarm on?
<s> I couldn't sleep last night.
<s> I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
<s> I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
<s> I want you to try something with me, okay?
<s> He jumped into the ocean.
<s> He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
<s> Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
<s> You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
<s> It could have been a squirt gun.
<s> He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
<s> If that's what it takes.
<s> After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
<s> how much weight have you lost?
<s> Maybe that's too long.
<s> I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I want you both to stay.
<s> We're getting out of the ground today.
<s> Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
<s> I'll ask.
<s> I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
<s> To check up on me?
<s> I'll hate you forever.
<s> I warned you yesterday.
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> I might have a solution.
<s> The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
<s> I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
<s> What's wrong with your back?
<s> You know what mortise and tenon is?
<s> I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
<s> I don't let him.  He just loves to.
<s> He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
<s> The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
<s> My stupid back.
<s> No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
<s> Going on?
<s> That was the truth.
<s> I can't pick you up.
<s> No.  Mostly me.
<s> What?
<s> It's not my back that's killing me.
<s> I'm an idiot to have you up there.
<s> I'm thinking it's too weird now.
<s> Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
<s> What are you doing home?
<s> Sam took them to a movie.
<s> That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
<s> Either do you.
<s> Can you stay for dinner?
<s> Yeah.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Better make it a week.
<s> It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
<s> Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
<s> Hell with him. It ain't that.
<s> But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
<s> Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
<s> I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
<s> Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
<s> Take care of me?
<s> Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
<s> Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
<s> I know it begins with a "C"...
<s> Claude Banks.
<s> You went to Monroe?
<s> Good old Monroe.
<s> You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
<s> Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
<s> Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
<s> What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
<s> Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
<s> The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
<s> Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
<s> Forget it.
<s> At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
<s> Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
<s> How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
<s> Say what?
<s> Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
<s> What am I gonna eat?
<s> Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
<s> I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
<s> Him?
<s> All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
<s> We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
<s> I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
<s> You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
<s> I said you're soft.
<s> Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
<s> Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
<s> State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
<s> Move it out.
<s> Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
<s> I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
<s> Just like Elvis.
<s> Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
<s> I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
<s> Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
<s> Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
<s> I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
<s> Like you shot Winston Hancock?
<s> He's sick?
<s> Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
<s> Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
<s> Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
<s> What do you think about... Earth?
<s> Don't do it!
<s> Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
<s> I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
<s> An angel?
<s> Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
<s> Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
<s> He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
<s> It's freezing up here, Beefy.
<s> I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
<s> Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
<s> Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
<s> Release the evil?
<s> Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
<s> Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
<s> Metallica, Dad. Come on.
<s> Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
<s> What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
<s> Coulda been much worse.
<s> That's a pretty brassiere.
<s> I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
<s> Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
<s> You smell like coconuts.
<s> That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
<s> I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
<s> That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
<s> I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
<s> What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
<s> Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
<s> Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
<s> It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
<s> Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
<s> Even the alarm didn't wake him.
<s> Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
<s> Did you ever see anybody renew?
<s> Did you?
<s> Here.
<s> I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
<s> I'm afraid to tell you.
<s> I suppose. But what if you want to live?
<s> But I wasn't sure you'd come.
<s> Thanks... but I have the choice.
<s> I don't have much time.
<s> Of course --
<s> I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
<s> We'll convince them.
<s> I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
<s> He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
<s> Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
<s> Yes...
<s> Mother and Father said so... you know?
<s> Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
<s> Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
<s> No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
<s> No, no, no
<s> Never, never, ever. Nothing.
<s> It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
<s> Sheila'll be at "Tops".
<s> Okay.
<s> Sure, I'm okay.
<s> It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
<s> His or ours?
<s> It's me...
<s> I can't see you tonight.
<s> Me, too.
<s> We should stop seeing each other.
<s> Pete... Don't...
<s> Okay...
<s> Okay.
<s> What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
<s> I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
<s> Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
<s> Do ya good.
<s> No.
<s> Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
<s> No... I don't. Why?
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Yes, I just found it on the step.
<s> What job?
<s> How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
<s> Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
<s> No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
<s> All right!
<s> Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
<s> I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
<s> We just killed a couple of people...
<s> Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
<s> What's the BITCH'S name?!
<s> Oh, read it!
<s> Fossils.
<s> Well, what do you know about that!
<s> Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
<s> Why, of course. Yes.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Will you stop squawking!
<s> I'm thinking.
<s> So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
<s> This doesn't obligate me in any way.
<s> Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
<s> Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
<s> Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
<s> Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
<s> Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
<s> When are you going to start?
<s> Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
<s> He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
<s> You have no disputes over women?
<s> They were.
<s> Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
<s> Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
<s> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<s> The only one.
<s> No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
<s> I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
<s> Why, no.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Father Perrault is dead.
<s> Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
<s> It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
<s> Chang's first question was about the pilot.
<s> All right. Sorry, George.
<s> So you think I'm mad?
<s> So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
<s> Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
<s> Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
<s> Oh, George . . .
<s> George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
<s> I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
<s> There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
<s> I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
<s> Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
<s> Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
<s> I saw a man whose life was empty.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
<s> Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
<s> Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
<s> Please don't go.
<s> All right, I'll be there.
<s> Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
<s> It's not even a fucking door.
<s> And Goodwill Toward Man?
<s> I gotta be honest about something.
<s> Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
<s> We're the government, Cowan.
<s> Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
<s> Kay...
<s> There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
<s> The Pentagon.
<s> I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
<s> What if he's telling the truth?
<s> Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
<s> Kay.  All I'm saying--
<s> That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
<s> For how long?
<s> All of it?
<s> And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
<s> Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
<s> The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
<s> They respond to fear, right?
<s> Come on now.  People are smart.
<s> Actually, yeah--
<s> This guy.  Where was he?
<s> Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
<s> But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
<s> Wait-- listen--
<s> So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
<s> Dee?  What are you doing here?
<s> They went right to the President.
<s> Why?
<s> Found?  Where?
<s> Yeah --
<s> How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
<s> I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
<s> I'm fine, Lamar.
<s> All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
<s> Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
<s> Georgetown.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Yes.
<s> You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
<s> You gonna tell on me?
<s> Oh... Hi, John.
<s> Tell me how.
<s> I guess that's all of it.
<s> What a big boy.  How old are you?
<s> Wanna hear something funny?
<s> I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
<s> I'm your son.  I'm you.
<s> Hold your breath, Dad...
<s> NO!
<s> Who said I would?
<s> I'm... not... a... killer.
<s> Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
<s> I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
<s> The female.
<s> None of your damn business.
<s> Wait, just a second...
<s> Not quite.
<s> How?
<s> Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
<s> We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
<s> Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
<s> People have gotten the message.  Gum?
<s> Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
<s> Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
<s> We can stop him.
<s> How many?
<s> I think you're swell company, Knott.
<s> I know who you are.
<s> Yes.
<s> You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
<s> You're Bobby, right?
<s> No thank you.
<s> No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
<s> We have snifters
<s> Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
<s> Yeah. Take it.
<s> What if I gave you forty?
<s> But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
<s> She's, uh, sleeping.
<s> Mommy's not home?
<s> Where were you?
<s> Shhh. He'll hear you.
<s> How could you let her see this?
<s> Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
<s> Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
<s> Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
<s> Draw.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
<s> And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
<s> Ricky's taken care of.
<s> Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
<s> That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
<s> He'll work it off.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
<s> We get it. We're sorry.
<s> Where's the drop?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
<s> Understand me?
<s> It's important.
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> I will.
<s> I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
<s> C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
<s> I promised Chloe we'd come here.
<s> We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
<s> Fuck...
<s> Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
<s> You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
<s> Missing what? He didn't say shit.
<s> What did I 'get?'
<s> What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
<s> You too?
<s> Work's over. I'm gonna party.
<s> Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
<s> She was jonesing for me.
<s> What's up?
<s> Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
<s> I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
<s> Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
<s> C'mon, man...
<s> The what?
<s> You're out of money?
<s> I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
<s> Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
<s> Bobby and Ricky.
<s> And you grew up in Manhattan?
<s> I didn't do anything --
<s> He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
<s> Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
<s> Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
<s> The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
<s> You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
<s> When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
<s> Man's rep travels.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I done told the man what he could do with his train.
<s> Just now.
<s> You never had it.
<s> You know it.
<s> I don't want your money.
<s> Elijah who?
<s> What do you do with your time?
<s> Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
<s> A black man playing big league ball is something.
<s> Then the devil is white.
<s> Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
<s> No, Brother Minister.
<s> If you want to tell me.
<s> That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
<s> Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
<s> There's nothing to talk about.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
<s> Yes. Did you eat?
<s> Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
<s> Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
<s> What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
<s> You have to sleep for three.
<s> At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
<s> Entirely.
<s> I say a lot of things.
<s> Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
<s> Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
<s> Your control over your children, therefore --
<s> How long has this been going on?
<s> Eat lead, coppers.
<s> The hell you are.
<s> I ain't doing bad.
<s> Brothers of Brother Johnson.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Allah will provide.
<s> I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
<s> He's bright.
<s> So you are going to talk me to death.
<s> Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
<s> [I'm on to Juarez.]
<s> [I have a friend there.]
<s> So where do we begin?
<s> I have connections.
<s> He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
<s> How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
<s> [So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
<s> [Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
<s> [The what?]
<s> [Four-seven-four-seven.]
<s> [The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
<s> [So am I, Sister.]
<s> [Where do I find him?]
<s> [I believe you.]
<s> [And?]
<s> [O.K. So tell me more.]
<s> [Don't lie to me!]
<s> [That's what everybody keeps saying.]
<s> Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
<s> My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
<s> Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
<s> A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
<s> Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
<s> Maybe...
<s> Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
<s> It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
<s> It's better to be free, right?
<s> I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
<s> Yes.
<s> But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
<s> Yeah. Two or three.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Could I stop you?
<s> Dyslexic?
<s> I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
<s> For a year?
<s> She understands men.
<s> [The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
<s> [No. Why?]
<s> These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
<s> Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
<s> Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
<s> Why? You were so pleased with him.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> She's young. She'll get over it.
<s> I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
<s> I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
<s> What for?
<s> I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
<s> I came to see you. How you feel?
<s> You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
<s> It's her baby too, you know.
<s> Well, it ain't your baby.
<s> I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
<s> This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
<s> Who?
<s> You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
<s> I really should get home...
<s> I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
<s> Please...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
<s> About eight o'clock.
<s> I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
<s> Tomatoes.
<s> Marty...
<s> You gonna die without a son.
<s> Put on your blue suit...
<s> Marty...
<s> Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
<s> She's twenty-nine, Ma.
<s> You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
<s> Waddaya read there, Joe?
<s> What nurses?
<s> Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
<s> Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
<s> Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
<s> So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
<s> Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
<s> Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
<s> That's all right, that's all right...
<s> I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
<s> Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
<s> You talked to Walt?
<s> What is, Red, the intention or the act?
<s> Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
<s> I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
<s> Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
<s> Home.
<s> There's only one way.
<s> Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
<s> And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
<s> Perfectionist.
<s> Duke Forrest.
<s> Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
<s> Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
<s> The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
<s> Call Dago Red.
<s> Yeah, if I can.
<s> Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
<s> No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
<s> Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
<s> But what about Major Houlihan?
<s> You willing to b-back that up with odds?
<s> At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
<s> All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
<s> C-A-M-E-M...?
<s> Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
<s> I like an olive.
<s> But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
<s> So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
<s> I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
<s> Radar!
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
<s> It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
<s> It isn't always this rough?
<s> They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
<s> Maria...
<s> I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
<s> I didn't have much choice.
<s> What do you want with those two medical officers?
<s> Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
<s> Tell me the whole story, Walt.
<s> You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
<s> That. It's out of the act.
<s> Nope, we're assigned heah.
<s> If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
<s> I did. First and only blow. So far.
<s> I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
<s> Damn.
<s> What's that, Henry?
<s> I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
<s> Now?
<s> Nice.
<s> Can't. I'm feeling too good.
<s> With all of it?
<s> Oh, crabby guy, huh?
<s> Who?
<s> John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Money.
<s> How do you do.
<s> No, no, nothat's your seat.
<s> Your purse. I need ten dollars.
<s> Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
<s> Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
<s> What John Doe?
<s> A deal?
<s> He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
<s> I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
<s> Oh.
<s> Friend of his. They play duets together.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
<s> You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
<s> The heelots!
<s> The heelots!
<s> Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
<s> What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
<s> Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
<s> John Doe Club?
<s> Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
<s> You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
<s> Whyuh
<s> Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
<s> Were you paid for itor weren't you?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
<s> Okay.
<s> I think it must have been a sea- gull.
<s> Deal.
<s> It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
<s> Good. I don't want to be late.
<s> Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
<s> Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
<s> They want Walter dead!
<s> Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
<s> I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
<s> Then where's my FUCKING car!
<s> ...a car.
<s> ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
<s> Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
<s> We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
<s> Roper...
<s> You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
<s> I've rarely shot anyone.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
<s> Around. Barnett's tough competition.
<s> I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
<s> Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
<s> A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
<s> You're a compulsive gambler?
<s> I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
<s> Still needs work.
<s> I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
<s> So what do you want to do?
<s> Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
<s> Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
<s> Only that floor.
<s> What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
<s> And why the fuck would you do that for me?
<s> Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
<s> Yeah that's it.
<s> It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
<s> And you think he'll...
<s> Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
<s> I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
<s> Depends. What's up?
<s> He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
<s> Who's running it?
<s> Yeah, they are but...
<s> I need to take back what's mine.
<s> -- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
<s> Someone who believes in miracles.
<s> Yes.
<s> -- Two million people plugged-in here.
<s> -- He will.
<s> New York.
<s> Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
<s> Cleaning up a mess.
<s> Once they digitized you, they added it.
<s> Realize?
<s> Sorry?!
<s> Activated.
<s> Checking connection.
<s> How can we reach Phaedos?
<s> What?!
<s> They're called squirbs.
<s> Ah... sure.
<s> Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
<s> What does that mean?!
<s> Where did it originate?
<s> I am the crane, agile and sublime!
<s> WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
<s> Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
<s> A stellar idea, Skull.
<s> What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
<s> Did I say anything?
<s> GO IVAN!!
<s> You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
<s> So they've been destroyed?
<s> How'd you know?
<s> From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
<s> NINJA FALCON ZORD!
<s> And I ain't no nigger either!
<s> I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
<s> Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
<s> I guess I am. Just a little.
<s> Could we step outside?
<s> Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
<s> But if ya can't catch the guys...
<s> You got men on Profaci's place?
<s> London?
<s> As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
<s> So what is the problem?
<s> I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
<s> So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
<s> Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
<s> Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
<s> Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
<s> That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
<s> Not if they all die at once.
<s> Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
<s> Come on, Charlie. We got business.
<s> I must know more of you, my son.
<s> I've got friends.
<s> He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
<s> That's why I'm here.
<s> That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
<s> Shuddup.
<s> Spare us.
<s> We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
<s> Yeah. But he needs me alive.
<s> Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
<s> I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
<s> Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
<s> Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
<s> Uhh - martini?
<s> Well - you'd need a body.
<s> It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
<s> Thank me next time you see me.
<s> How much?
<s> I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
<s> Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
<s> He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
<s> Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
<s> It looks so...<u>new</u>.
<s> That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
<s> Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
<s> I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
<s> Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
<s> <i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
<s> <u>What</u> union?
<s> I don't <u>know</u>.
<s> What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
<s> Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
<s> No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
<s> Mother!
<s> Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
<s> Oh, I hope so, dear.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
<s> I'm saying I didn't sign it!
<s> Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
<s> No!
<s> You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
<s> Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
<s> Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
<s> Paine.
<s> I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
<s> Can't that wait, Hubert?
<s> That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
<s> Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
<s> He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
<s> Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
<s> I *won't* send Horace Miller!
<s> Me! Jim--how--?
<s> The--head?
<s> Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
<s> Emma!
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
<s> Mr. President!
<s> I yield.
<s> Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
<s> Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
<s> No.
<s> The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
<s> Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
<s> I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
<s> Satan's in this little fella tonight!
<s> We'd better see.
<s> Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
<s> Tonight.
<s> Why?
<s> Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
<s> Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
<s> Terrible, thank you.
<s> It *is* not!
<s> No!
<s> Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
<s> Second drawer.
<s> Saunders--!
<s> Are you drunk?
<s> But--I've done everything I--
<s> Hurray!
<s> Goodnight, Senator--
<s> You were about to recognize me, sir--
<s> How's that, buddy?
<s> Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
<s> Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
<s> Well, well!
<s> Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
<s> You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
<s> Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
<s> Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
<s> It's crucifying him--!
<s> No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
<s> Such pretty knees for a big boy!
<s> What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
<s> Some people like it.
<s> Deeds?
<s> Who's that?
<s> Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
<s> Sometimes twice.
<s> Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
<s> You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
<s> Oh. What's happening about the opera?
<s> What did they say?
<s> That depends on what they see.
<s> Oh, that
<s> I'm from a small town too, you know.
<s> What did he play?
<s> Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
<s> A girl?
<s> Oh, hello darling.
<s> No. It's nothing.
<s> Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
<s> I'm crucifying him.
<s> No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Have lunch.
<s> Yes.
<s> Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
<s> Oh, as bad as that, huh?
<s> John
<s> A smaller bowl of flowers.
<s> Let me go! I wanna see him!
<s> I'm not interested in the newspapers.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> All right.
<s> Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
<s> Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
<s> Huh?
<s> How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
<s> You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
<s> Why should you?
<s> I don't think we've got any suitcases.
<s> Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
<s> Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
<s> Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
<s> No, I mean - about my client.
<s> Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
<s> Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
<s> Binge?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> You're Walter, aren't you?
<s> I just wanted to make sure.
<s> I did what!
<s> Who?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Me more than most.
<s> Good kids.
<s> Really? You think so?
<s> What happened?
<s> Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
<s> Good, then go.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> What?!
<s> And the experiment is in here?
<s> My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
<s> I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
<s> Nope.
<s> I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
<s> I do.
<s> Yes, your honor.
<s> It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
<s> Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
<s> Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
<s> You're good.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> There's something I think we need to talk about.
<s> Why don't you tell me?
<s> I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
<s> Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
<s> I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
<s> People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
<s> Is she against you getting help?
<s> No.
<s> Sorry... I'm done.
<s> So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
<s> Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
<s> Of course.
<s> Is something wrong, Sofie?
<s> Um-huh.
<s> Transference.
<s> Hello.
<s> Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
<s> No again?
<s> Really?
<s> I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
<s> Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
<s> This --
<s> Yep.
<s> Really?
<s> What'd I do?
<s> I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
<s> You're not going to kill us?
<s> Did you say 'kill' my sister?
<s> So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
<s> You always did have more balls than brains.
<s> Even?
<s> No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
<s> Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
<s> Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
<s> If you call that a kiss.
<s> Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
<s> You don't believe in curses, huh?
<s> I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
<s> You dream about dead guys?
<s> Very slowly.
<s> Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
<s> My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
<s> Picked his pocket, actually.
<s> Way to go, Evy.
<s> Awfully.
<s> I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
<s> My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
<s> Hello?
<s> I thought you'd chickened out on me.
<s> I saw him walk you home.
<s> Not tonight. 
<s> Date?
<s> I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
<s> That was easy. 
<s> Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
<s> There's a vague similarity.
<s> Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
<s> Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
<s> Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
<s> Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> The Eradicators!
<s> Not yet.
<s> We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
<s> Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
<s> Looking for... the TV Guide.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Yeah, but how do we get to them?
<s> Through there!
<s> General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
<s> For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
<s> I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
<s> And, what a delightful idea!
<s> Whatever suggested the idea to you?
<s> Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
<s> May I come to the map?
<s> I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> What forces do you have at your disposal?
<s> Any cannon?
<s> Properly arranged, yes.
<s> The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
<s> But who made this treaty?
<s> Yes, sire?
<s> Come back in an hour.
<s> Come in.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> A glass of champagne, please.
<s> That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
<s> I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
<s> Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
<s> You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
<s> And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
<s> Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
<s> Where is Madame Trillaud?
<s> Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
<s> I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
<s> Oh, then you are...
<s> No.
<s> Does she deserve anything better?
<s> That is correct.
<s> Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
<s> Eugene de Beauharnais.
<s> A message from Citizen Fouche.
<s> Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
<s> A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
<s> And I can go free?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know!
<s> Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
<s> Don't move me.
<s> I'm his cousin.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
<s> You know what he mean, dude.
<s> Black magic.
<s> It's something in that hydraulic pump.
<s> Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
<s> Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
<s> I can't taste nothing.
<s> Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
<s> That's the sister.
<s> Okay, plan B.
<s> D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
<s> That ain't gonna work.
<s> What's the B-G's?
<s> Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
<s> It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
<s> What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
<s> It's locked.
<s> So what?  Let's make'em wait.
<s> Hold on.
<s> Ya'll making me look like a punk.
<s> I do.
<s> Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
<s> Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
<s> Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
<s> You don't wanna know.
<s> Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
<s> I know.
<s> Let it go, Roach, trust me.
<s> Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
<s> Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
<s> I don't know.
<s> The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> What happened here?
<s> Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
<s> Uh, yes..
<s> San Diego.
<s> Ah.
<s> That's right.
<s> For not believing you.
<s> Don't worry. She's good with kids.
<s> Yes, I'm listening.
<s> Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
<s> That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
<s> Let me talk to her again.
<s> I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
<s> No way.
<s> Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
<s> Keep it.
<s> I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
<s> What?
<s> What are you supposed to do?
<s> I don't want my windshield cleaned.
<s> Everybody does?
<s> A surprise?
<s> Nah.  Hates his wife.
<s> 'Daddy has to go now.
<s> He carried on some; kicked.
<s> Hm!
<s> I'll bet.
<s> I will guard Pearl with my life...
<s> I been mindin' Pearl.
<s> Don't!
<s> Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
<s> Walt!
<s> She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
<s> It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
<s> John don't like him much.
<s> There's something else.
<s> Mister Powell!
<s> 'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
<s> Hm?
<s> Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
<s> Dead.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> Getting Pearl to bed. I --
<s> In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
<s> Come to me, boy!
<s> Yes?
<s> Tell me another secret about my Dad.
<s> Because John said I mustn't.
<s> But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
<s> Can I have this?
<s> Our honeymoon.
<s> Where's she at?
<s> How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
<s> Didn't you hear me, boy?
<s> None of your business, Madam.
<s> Pearl and John.
<s> You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
<s> Okay. Hi, dad.
<s> What?
<s> Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
<s> Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
<s> Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
<s> Okay.
<s> But that's just not reality, Nancy!
<s> He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
<s> You were screaming like crazy.
<s> Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
<s> No.
<s> Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
<s> Good evening, Ninotchka.
<s> Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
<s> About what?
<s> What do you wear in the morning?
<s> He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
<s> How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
<s> Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
<s> Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
<s> You didn't get legal advice?
<s> With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
<s> Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
<s> Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
<s> That's all right.
<s> Good evening, Monsieur.
<s> I don't feel like any breakfast.
<s> Eight forty-two, sir.
<s> You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
<s> May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
<s> That's perfect!
<s> If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
<s> Oh, Leon, you are so good.
<s> It's a real Paris reunion.
<s> ...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
<s> Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
<s> I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
<s> Comrade.
<s> Too bad we have to waste all that time.
<s> Yes, monsieur.
<s> All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
<s> No, thank you.
<s> No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
<s> Even the swallows are back.
<s> Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
<s> There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
<s> Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
<s> But you had!
<s> Oh no. No visa.
<s> Gladly.
<s> Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> How long does it take a man to land?
<s> Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
<s> I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
<s> Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
<s> He takes good care of that.
<s> Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
<s> That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
<s> For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
<s> You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
<s> I'd like to say it a thousand times.
<s> Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
<s> So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
<s> Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
<s> I promise... I swear.
<s> It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
<s> From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
<s> You must, darling.
<s> What, darling?
<s> Shhh! Shhh!
<s> Comrades! Good people of France!
<s> They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
<s> But I can throw it out of the window.
<s> Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
<s> We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
<s> Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
<s> Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
<s> We have nothing to discuss.
<s> Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
<s> I must ask you to leave.
<s> I must insist that you leave.
<s> In that case I can only say good-by.
<s> In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
<s> Why?
<s> I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
<s> It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
<s> How do you do, my friend.
<s> "Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
<s> What?
<s> Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
<s> No, we have nothing to hide.
<s> Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
<s> That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
<s> I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
<s> In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
<s> Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
<s> Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
<s> Mr. Hoover was a realist.
<s> Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
<s> You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
<s> That's what they're doing.
<s> Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
<s> Cox!  Fire him.
<s> I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
<s> It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
<s> And if I stay?
<s> That's right ...
<s> I don't know anything about that.
<s> Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
<s> The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
<s> Sir?
<s> Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
<s> What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
<s> Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
<s> You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
<s> Let him finish, Bob.
<s> ... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
<s> He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
<s> It's Helms -- it's got to be.
<s> How?
<s> No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
<s> What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
<s> I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
<s> Yes ...
<s> Yes.
<s> But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
<s> Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
<s> I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
<s> That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
<s> Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
<s> The White House.
<s> "A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
<s> Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
<s> I beg your pardon --
<s> He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
<s> I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
<s> No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
<s> What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
<s> Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
<s> You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
<s> ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
<s> Syracuse.
<s> Ernie Davis.
<s> Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
<s> Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
<s> Sir?
<s> Yes, yes.
<s> I know ...
<s> What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
<s> Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
<s> You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
<s> No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
<s> That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
<s> If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
<s> Do you really want this, Dick?
<s> I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
<s> Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
<s> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
<s> What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
<s> 'Predate it.
<s> Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
<s> It's not me he's in trouble with.
<s> I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
<s> I don't know. My mind wanders.
<s> Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
<s> What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
<s> I'm hidin' behind you.
<s> Believe you're right.
<s> Sir, I don't want to picture that.
<s> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
<s> That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
<s> He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
<s> Yes Sheriff.
<s> I never do.
<s> Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
<s> Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
<s> Yes. Things fall into place.
<s> You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> I know something better.
<s> Well -- where ya goin'?
<s> I don't need to talk to you.
<s> Yeah. I know where you're going.
<s> So what're you goin' up there for.
<s> I see.
<s> Now is not a time. What time do you close.
<s> Sir?
<s> You live in that house behind the store?
<s> You married into it.
<s> I don't know. I couldn't say.
<s> Everything.
<s> Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
<s> No sir, it's unusual.
<s> I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
<s> Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
<s> I do like you.
<s> Not any way.
<s> Yeah. I was in Nam.
<s> I don't know. American citizens.
<s> I got an overcoat on.
<s> Yes sir. Two tours.
<s> Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
<s> Oww! My arm, careful!
<s> I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
<s> You think a woman did that?!
<s> You said a woman couldn't have done it.
<s> She said she was in Arizona, did she?
<s> No, I didn't have to.
<s> No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
<s> Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
<s> You sure? Maybe next week we could...
<s> I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
<s> You're late, Eric.
<s> She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
<s> Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
<s> Didn't I?
<s> Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
<s> I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
<s> David, please --
<s> ...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
<s> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
<s> What?
<s> It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
<s> Roy! What are you doing here?
<s> Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
<s> Los Angeles, California.
<s> Did you love it?
<s> I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
<s> What? Where was he?!
<s> We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
<s> Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
<s> How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
<s> Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
<s> Oh, yes, with the coffee...
<s> Are we gonna do business here, or not?
<s> Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
<s> Hell of a way to die.
<s> You told me how to do it!
<s> Well, why'd you shoot him?
<s> You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
<s> I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
<s> It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
<s> ...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
<s> What the hell's the matter with you?
<s> You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
<s> Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
<s> I don't know, George...
<s> No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
<s> Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
<s> Our pleasure, Big Dan.
<s> Waitaminute -
<s> Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
<s> How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
<s> No, they never did turn me into a toad.
<s> Good Lord, what do we do?
<s> Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
<s> What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
<s> Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
<s> Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
<s> Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
<s> Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
<s> Assa good idea, Pappy.
<s> In any state.
<s> Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
<s> Wipin' little circles with his bread...
<s> Now Penny, stop that!
<s> Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
<s> I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
<s> We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
<s> You -
<s> Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
<s> I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
<s> Aw, that's all right.
<s> I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
<s> No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
<s> Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
<s> Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
<s> They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
<s> Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
<s> We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
<s> He ain't our daddy!
<s> Blooey!
<s> You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
<s> From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
<s> Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
<s> No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
<s> Why? Because you can do it alone?
<s> Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
<s> Aw screw it...
<s> No, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> What are you tired from?
<s> Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
<s> Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
<s> Let's just wait and see what happens.
<s> Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
<s> Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
<s> Great.
<s> Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
<s> No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
<s> My kinda group!
<s> I know who you are and what you want.
<s> To have a good time with you until you have to go.
<s> It sure was.
<s> That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
<s> When I'm good and ready.
<s> So?
<s> Why?
<s> Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
<s> Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
<s> She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
<s> Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
<s> I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
<s> Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
<s> I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
<s> It's mine.
<s> Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
<s> Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
<s> Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
<s> What about us?  What if she has a gun?
<s> We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
<s> Shit!
<s> Can we come in?
<s> Huh?
<s> It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
<s> Nobody leaves.
<s> What?
<s> PANIC ROOM!
<s> They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
<s> They're coming in here, aren't they?
<s> On it!
<s> I'm dizzy, not deaf.
<s> What if I keep dropping?
<s> But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
<s> What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
<s> That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
<s> You know it brother.
<s> Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
<s> They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
<s> Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
<s> Yeah, it's me.
<s> Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
<s> Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
<s> Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
<s> I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
<s> And did you witness the shoot-out?
<s> Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
<s> You mean...
<s> We're like policing the police.
<s> Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
<s> Yeah.
<s> So what's the deal?
<s> No man. Gonna walk.
<s> What, I don't know how you mean?
<s> Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
<s> Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> Well, act like it. Come on.
<s> If you got something to say, say it.
<s> Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
<s> No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
<s> All of the above, man...  And then some.
<s> Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
<s> That would be nice, too.
<s> You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
<s> His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
<s> They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
<s> Sir.
<s> Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
<s> He tried.  It didn't take.
<s> Yes...  ... father.
<s> We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
<s> Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
<s> Please.
<s> That's five, keep going...
<s> You said bribery twice...
<s> That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
<s> Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
<s> Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
<s> I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
<s> Four, five miles.
<s> We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
<s> Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
<s> Earned.
<s> Is that right, dad?
<s> He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
<s> I hate that smell.
<s> Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
<s> Allman Brothers.
<s> The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
<s> Then come on.
<s> Is there quicksand?
<s> You're telling me.
<s> Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
<s> Whose burying ground?
<s> Your cairn.
<s> The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
<s> Louis, the house is beautiful.
<s> And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
<s> You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
<s> That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
<s> What're you suggesting?
<s> Men!  Are you up for it?
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
<s> Commodore, you can't do that!
<s> What?
<s> Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
<s> Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
<s> I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
<s> The trees are taller.
<s> You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
<s> One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
<s> You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
<s> Nor did you, I noticed.
<s> First -- have you found me a crew?
<s> She can hold a bit longer.
<s> We're not going to just surrender!
<s> Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
<s> You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
<s> As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
<s> We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
<s> By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
<s> I knew you'd listen to reason!
<s> No.
<s> And you want to turn pirate yourself?
<s> We need to go!
<s> Good.
<s> My father.  William Turner?
<s> Barbossa.
<s> I'll lead them away.
<s> Jack!
<s> Yes.
<s> He's not telling the truth.
<s> Speak.
<s> But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
<s> Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
<s> If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
<s> Maybe you should, but you can't.
<s> Ain't it.
<s> Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
<s> You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
<s> Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
<s> No, Icky, this is real.
<s> Why are there two ottomans?
<s> Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
<s> If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
<s> The nanobot is gone.
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
<s> This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
<s> I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
<s> What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
<s> You know, this and that.
<s> I guess I should be flattered.
<s> All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
<s> Mouse?  What mouse?
<s> That was 'simple'?
<s> The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
<s> I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
<s> I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
<s> Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
<s> It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
<s> Let's go.
<s> The same thing I suppose.
<s> Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
<s> Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
<s> Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
<s> Yes, that is what I was thinking.
<s> Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
<s> So, it's obvious, huh?
<s> Sure, I'll take a chance.
<s> Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
<s> My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
<s> It isn't cheap. It's nice.
<s> Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
<s> Gallagher?
<s> Good morning. What does this mean?
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
<s> Oh, man!
<s> Well, I should say!
<s> I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
<s> All right, all right, don't mention it.
<s> I certainly will.
<s> You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Gloria Golden?
<s> I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
<s> No!
<s> Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
<s> I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
<s> Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
<s> I didn't run away.
<s> Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
<s> I hope you'll be very happy.
<s> Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes - and I'd love it.
<s> Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
<s> Never even been to New Madrid.
<s> Very good.
<s> Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
<s> The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
<s> Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
<s> I have it here.
<s> I beg your pardon.
<s> Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
<s> About what? Your marriage to Anne!
<s> Have you seen this? 
<s> Thanks.
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> In my handbag.
<s> Looks just like it did.
<s> What?
<s> I won't.
<s> Bud brought it to me.
<s> Here's my favorite.
<s> Oh, George ...
<s> Oh, gosh no.
<s> Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
<s> You want to get out of here?
<s> Why not?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> One of those ... big beds?
<s> Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
<s> Yes I did.
<s> Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
<s> Still doesn't make it right.
<s> Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
<s> Very well ...
<s> Oh sure it is.
<s> Well, I never had to do it before.
<s> Oh. guess I could do that, then.
<s> What?
<s> Hello Mr. Simpson.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Yeah. Every episode ever.
<s> We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
<s> I like--really need a cigarette, too.
<s> Well if I don't who will?
<s> The pages filled in?
<s> Wow.
<s> What?
<s> Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
<s> They just grow like that?
<s> Sure ...
<s> Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
<s> McGinty's.
<s> That's right.
<s> Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
<s> Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
<s> Oh--well ...
<s> What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
<s> Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
<s> Why?
<s> No, that's not it.
<s> I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
<s> You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
<s> TV repair?
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
<s> This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah but what are you doing?
<s> So you can't talk to me?
<s> "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
<s> You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
<s> I'm just stopping by to say hello.
<s> It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
<s> I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
<s> -- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
<s> Yeah I can't.
<s> I feel really on the spot now.
<s> I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
<s> I....please don't do this.
<s> There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
<s> I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
<s> You sound very cute, very nice.
<s> No.
<s> It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
<s> I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
<s> I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
<s> No. I'm sorry.
<s> I don't have a girlfriend --
<s> I know I did. But I don't.
<s> I have to go.
<s> Not very well.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hi.
<s> Ok.
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure.
<s> About six months.
<s> I'm sorry. I thought you said --
<s> ...I don't know what you mean....
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's Barry.
<s> What's that? What is that that you're doing?
<s> This is funny.
<s> It's ok to ask that.
<s> What is this?
<s> If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
<s> For what?
<s> It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
<s> Well who did?
<s> I know.
<s> Why?
<s> Can I ask how much is this?
<s> No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
<s> You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
<s> That's that.
<s> I think you have a call?
<s> ....I have seven.
<s> I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
<s> What do you have in the house?
<s> What is this, man?
<s> Seriously.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
<s> Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
<s> -- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
<s> Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
<s> He's a writer, not a madman.
<s> Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
<s> Mustn't do that, sir.
<s> I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
<s> But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
<s> One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
<s> That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
<s> You always do.
<s> Good day, Marquis.
<s> Valcour. His chair.
<s> You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
<s> Then it must've been love --
<s> This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
<s> Well...?
<s> -- then I've friends of my own to visit.
<s> Oh indeed?
<s> That's not our intent --
<s> You'd suffer in her stead?
<s> He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
<s> Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
<s> I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
<s> There's something else I want from you.
<s> The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
<s> You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
<s> Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
<s> It's tainted money, Doctor.
<s> I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
<s> Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
<s> How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
<s> It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
<s> Very much.
<s> Not you too
<s> Houdini mice.
<s> Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
<s> Do you?
<s> Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
<s> Randolph!
<s> One . . . buys things.
<s> I don't want you to--
<s> "You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
<s> I can't remember the lines!
<s> "You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
<s> Huh?
<s> Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
<s> Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
<s> I don't wanna write about no spic.
<s> The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
<s> I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
<s> Don't do this
<s> Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
<s> And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
<s> Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
<s> No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
<s> Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
<s> Jews. She's talking about Jews.
<s> What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
<s> You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
<s> This ain't George's doing--!
<s> Thank you-
<s> And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
<s> No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
<s> Ah, it's a grand title.
<s> Then find another theater
<s> I don't want to sit
<s> Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
<s> Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
<s> About what?
<s> I'm Ok.
<s> Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
<s> I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
<s> I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
<s> I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
<s> I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
<s> Whadda you care?
<s> She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
<s> You wasn't with her?
<s> You want the title shot?
<s> What did Tommy say?
<s> What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
<s> Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
<s> When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
<s> Whadda ya mean?
<s> I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
<s> Does that mean...
<s> Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
<s> Can you see it?
<s> Jake...
<s> What do you mean, "good looking?"
<s> Who asked you?
<s> No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
<s> Yeah, what?
<s> What did I say?
<s> I never noticed his face.
<s> Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
<s> "Father of the Bride."
<s> I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
<s> Why don't you just call him?
<s> Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
<s> Jake, sit down for a minute.
<s> All right, I'll try. See you later.
<s> I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
<s> When the lock is broken -- yes.
<s> You think I made all this up?
<s> All right -- you don't believe me.
<s> What time?
<s> Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
<s> A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
<s> Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
<s> Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
<s> You think he's getting out of here?
<s> This is Doyle, Jeff.
<s> Your Lisa?
<s> Where'd they take Lisa?
<s> Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
<s> Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
<s> I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
<s> That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
<s> Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
<s> Well, I only quote from the best.
<s> It crashed, didn't it?
<s> You've got a hormone deficiency.
<s> She's all right.
<s> Stella!
<s> Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
<s> People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
<s> How did you know!
<s> It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
<s> Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
<s> There's probably one in the basement.
<s> Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
<s> Mrs. Doyle?
<s> He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
<s> Going on right here. It's a big night.
<s> Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
<s> It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
<s> I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
<s> I have one now.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> There's nothing to see.
<s> Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
<s> Don't you see how silly you're being?
<s> He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
<s> Thinking about Thorwald?
<s> Still -- those witnesses.
<s> Who was the trunk addressed to?
<s> Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
<s> You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
<s> It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
<s> Two minutes.
<s> Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
<s> A new disease.
<s> What?
<s> I'm cute, too.
<s> Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
<s> Somebody find him a knife.
<s> How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
<s> Hi.
<s> Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
<s> You make any sandwiches?
<s> Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
<s> Shoot, Jimbo.
<s> Well, now--
<s> I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
<s> I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
<s> Sure.  Sure.
<s> Have some cigars.
<s> Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
<s> That's right!
<s> Look--just relax, will you?
<s> Open it.
<s> Stay here.  That was my son!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
<s> Who's that!
<s> Hey!  How 'bout that!
<s> You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I need it.
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
<s> Just tell a little white lie?
<s> Grandma?
<s> Pretty mixed up?
<s> Dig the square wardrobe!
<s> I'm not so bad.
<s> Have you ever gone with anyone who--
<s> You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
<s> What?
<s> It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
<s> It is for me too.
<s> He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
<s> I'll never get close to anybody.
<s> You said you'd call my father.
<s> With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
<s> I didn't want to stop.
<s> No, baby. He wants me.
<s> One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
<s> What, he should see me help you catch him?
<s> That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
<s> Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
<s> I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
<s> Beauty and fragrances.
<s> What the fuck is going on.
<s> What's going ON!!!
<s> Nick, what are you --
<s> You're not hearing me here --
<s> So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
<s> No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
<s> Nick, what are you talking about?
<s> If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
<s> They all are. Football's on.
<s> Yeah. That's love.
<s> Rudy. How'd you know my name?
<s> I never worked at no casino.
<s> Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
<s> What college.
<s> At least gimme video poker.
<s> You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
<s> ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
<s> Nnn... nothing...
<s> Nothing... I promise-nothing...
<s> I'm no threat without a gun.
<s> 'Tis the season, convict.
<s> Show's over.
<s> OPEN IT!!!
<s> GO!!!
<s> We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
<s> Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
<s> We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
<s> How do we do that?
<s> I promise you, I didn't know!
<s> It's a roach, guy --
<s> Fuckin, Zookerman --
<s> Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
<s> Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
<s> Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
<s> Thought you hate your old man.
<s> Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
<s> Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
<s> I... sorry, Mister...
<s> Well...sorry...
<s> I'm ninety-two years old --
<s> Thanks, don't mind if I do.
<s> First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
<s> Fine, now.
<s> Who?
<s> Elois?
<s> What?
<s> That's okay, Eddie, I do.
<s> You ever seen this motherfucker before?
<s> What about?
<s> The Milwaukee Brewers?
<s> Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
<s> Sure.
<s> Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
<s> What do you care?
<s> Who gives a damn?
<s> And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
<s> What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
<s> Nice Guy Eddie.
<s> You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
<s> Uh-uh. I don't tip.
<s> Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
<s> Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
<s> That's not correct.
<s> A few cops.
<s> What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
<s> What do you think?
<s> Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
<s> I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
<s> Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
<s> Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
<s> That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
<s> He ain't dead.
<s> I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
<s> Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
<s> Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
<s> If we don't, he'll die.
<s> Nobody. The light was bad.
<s> Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
<s> I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
<s> Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He's learning his letters.
<s> Hold on.
<s> Thanks.
<s> It's too light yet.
<s> You're not going out to look for them?
<s> What?
<s> I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
<s> It's going to Sonora.
<s> The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
<s> Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
<s> That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
<s> Finished, son?
<s> You better start.
<s> Kind of sore.
<s> Nobody asked you to.
<s> No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
<s> You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
<s> They went on like I told you.
<s> Depends on how good you drive.
<s> What's the use.
<s> Put on another one.
<s> I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
<s> That's the end of the line.
<s> From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
<s> No.
<s> Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
<s> Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
<s> Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
<s> No, stay.
<s> Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
<s> Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
<s> Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
<s> Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
<s> Can you feel that?
<s> Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
<s> Listen to me I --
<s> Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
<s> I don't care. You pick.
<s> I think so.
<s> So, whatever happened to her?
<s> It's okay.
<s> This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
<s> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
<s> Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
<s> Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
<s> Saw who?!
<s> Let me see the files.
<s> What's this?
<s> They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
<s> And sexy.
<s> Alright. Come on, you guys.
<s> That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
<s> Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
<s> It says, "Ray."
<s> Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
<s> Mother? 
<s> He's really cute!
<s> Always the dentist.
<s> Let me see!
<s> Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
<s> We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
<s> We can be real quiet...
<s> Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
<s> It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
<s> PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
<s> Socially... I'll have a beer.
<s> I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
<s> I do, please.
<s> Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
<s> I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
<s> ...Browsing.
<s> Yes... but... I didn't...
<s> No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
<s> Right here!
<s> Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
<s> From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
<s> That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
<s> Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
<s> What sort of danger?
<s> You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
<s> I ought to know.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
<s> There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
<s> Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
<s> Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
<s> Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
<s> You will die.
<s> You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
<s> Good-bye.
<s> I won't get lonely.
<s> Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
<s> But you're always at the library.
<s> Devil worshippers!
<s> He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
<s> I understand.
<s> I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
<s> Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
<s> Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
<s> We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
<s> I'm afraid not.
<s> Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
<s> Thank you, my dear.
<s> I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
<s> Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
<s> No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
<s> Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
<s> I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
<s> Please.
<s> What did he say?
<s> What about Judd -- he knows about us.
<s> Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
<s> No. Why?
<s> No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
<s> Nine years.
<s> I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
<s> No.
<s> I feel like they do.
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
<s> Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
<s> Ann. Hello.
<s> Videotapes.
<s> I'm sorry this came up.
<s> Why not?
<s> What difference does it make why I do it?
<s> What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
<s> It won't. Are you ready?
<s> Ann Bishop Millaney.
<s> When we're making love?
<s> It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
<s> No.
<s> So you lied to her?
<s> I'm not in love with you.
<s> Possibly.
<s> I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
<s> And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
<s> No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
<s> Are you having an affair?
<s> I want out of this marriage.
<s> I want out of this marriage.
<s> Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
<s> The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
<s> Did you find him attractive?
<s> I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
<s> Why?
<s> You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
<s> Well, I wonder why.
<s> Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
<s> What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
<s> Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
<s> Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
<s> I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
<s> Did you take your clothes off?
<s> There's a phone here.
<s> You want me to leave?
<s> Nope.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> That's all.
<s> Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
<s> I turn on the camera. You start talking.
<s> Yes.
<s> Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
<s> Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
<s> I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
<s> Nothing wrong with trying.
<s> You told Ann about this?
<s> Graham.
<s> God, you... you're mean.
<s> I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
<s> No.  You said three-fifty?
<s> What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
<s> You have family here also?
<s> I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
<s> No.
<s> Yes?
<s> All right, jesus.
<s> Was he nice to you?
<s> Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> What do you want to call me at the office for?
<s> I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
<s> Just breathe normally.
<s> Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
<s> It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
<s> Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
<s> They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
<s> Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
<s> Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
<s> Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
<s> It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
<s> It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
<s> Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
<s> Indulge?
<s> Shove it, Ralph!
<s> I don't want to get up there.
<s> What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
<s> Absolutely correct.
<s> That doesn't make sense.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm sorry, Officer.
<s> YOUNG BLOOD
<s> But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
<s> Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
<s> YOU'RE NO GOOD
<s> YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
<s> OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
<s> CRIMINAL
<s> We love you, Baby.
<s> It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
<s> Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
<s> You guys having fun?
<s> Good. That's good.
<s> Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
<s> Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
<s> What are you pouring tonight?
<s> If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
<s> Stephanie.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> No, I'm an actor.
<s> Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
<s> I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
<s> I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> I thought you hated Chardonnay.
<s> What color is it supposed to be?
<s> Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
<s> Just a minute!
<s> It's not even a mile.
<s> Whoa.
<s> If that's what feels right.
<s> Then it's a good thing.
<s> Well, she does know a lot about wine.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> I want to go home now.
<s> I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
<s> She's been leaving messages here too.
<s> Yep.
<s> I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
<s> Nope.
<s> Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
<s> He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
<s> I know what you need.
<s> Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
<s> You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> The plan is... you go.
<s> My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
<s> Hrnrnrn?
<s> I'm fine. You rest.
<s> Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
<s> You need a new car anyway.
<s> Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
<s> You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
<s> The Windmill.
<s> See you.
<s> Twelve months in oak.
<s> Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Um... yeah but it's more...
<s> I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
<s> Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
<s> Don't touch me. Just take me home.
<s> Do you know what he's been saying to her?
<s> But you wanted to fuck me first.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
<s> I told you I need a drink.
<s> We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
<s> She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
<s> Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
<s> Only for pee or poop.
<s> This one?
<s> This one?
<s> Don't touch him.
<s> I heard them Morgan.
<s> Who said I was going to die?
<s> Hi baby.
<s> I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
<s> You got two minor league home run records don't you?
<s> Yes.
<s> Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
<s> Got it!
<s> I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
<s> I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
<s> What was the first thing?
<s> Why not?
<s> Yeah.
<s> No money, eh?
<s> Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
<s> What friend is that?
<s> There's nobody coming?
<s> Didn't Paden tell you that?
<s> It's one thing to know it...
<s> How's Mr. Parker doing?
<s> My name is Emmett.
<s> This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
<s> And they were two of them. Look --
<s> Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
<s> I expect.
<s> I understand.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I've got a job.
<s> I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
<s> What's that?
<s> Let's get out of here.
<s> I'm done talking. Get out.
<s> Really?
<s> What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
<s> So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
<s> I just got to town.
<s> It is that.
<s> I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
<s> Stella.
<s> Give me some of the good stuff.
<s> You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
<s> It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
<s> She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
<s> -- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
<s> Even the fall from the plane.
<s> Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
<s> Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
<s> Everyone you know is lying.
<s> No.
<s> Not if I don't let her.
<s> Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
<s> You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
<s> Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
<s> No... it's life.
<s> Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
<s> Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
<s> Yes, call me Simone.
<s> You don't secretly want the attention?
<s> You never were together, Hal.
<s> Clyde.
<s> But she's right there!  I must feel her!
<s> -- Please, get away from me.
<s> -- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
<s> It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
<s> I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
<s> This week anyhow.
<s> I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
<s> I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
<s> Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
<s> I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
<s> I do okay.  How about you?
<s> Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
<s> Abduction?
<s> Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
<s> Is that why she left you?
<s> It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
<s> Yes.
<s> Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
<s> Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
<s> Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
<s> We can keep it in the bathroom.
<s> What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
<s> Goodnight, sweetheart.
<s> No, just one.
<s> If it's okay with you?
<s> That I'm a freak.
<s> Yes.
<s> Dr. Crowe.
<s> Me too.
<s> I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
<s> Where will you go, where no one has died?
<s> I definitely won't.
<s> Lots of things.
<s> They did?
<s> They scare me too sometimes.
<s> What?
<s> You're a stuttering Stanley!
<s> Meaning?
<s> Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
<s> Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
<s> Bitch.
<s> The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
<s> Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
<s> Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
<s> Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
<s> "And a slash-slash there --"
<s> Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
<s> That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
<s> Amends...?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
<s> Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
<s> Nah. Just you.
<s> When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
<s> You never had trouble communicating before.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
<s> Aspirin.
<s> Okay.
<s> You took Bill.
<s> And this is mine.
<s> Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
<s> Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
<s> We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
<s> Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
<s> Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
<s> I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
<s> Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
<s> Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
<s> I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
<s> Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
<s> Ciao.
<s> No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
<s> You plan on driving trucks all your life?
<s> Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
<s> Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
<s> How'd you know?
<s> Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
<s> They're jammed!
<s> What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
<s> On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
<s> Not for long, you ain't.
<s> I'm at marker eight-five.
<s> I ran into complications.
<s> Then don't.
<s> Now what?
<s> I'm here.
<s> Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
<s> You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
<s> Who's Fred?
<s> That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
<s> -- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
<s> No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
<s> Mortal.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
<s> Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
<s> Ww... uh...
<s> You shot me and murdered my friends.
<s> You woulda?
<s> I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
<s> I'm not doing cocaine.
<s> That's not possible. I told you.
<s> -- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
<s> I said I got his machine.
<s> Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
<s> Without peer?
<s> They what? What? No. No. Why?
<s> Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
<s> -- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
<s> -- You can and you will.
<s> -- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
<s> So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
<s> It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
<s> Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
<s> No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
<s> Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
<s> That's the punchline, y'ready?
<s> Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
<s> You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
<s> Got hit twice.
<s> Like a mafucka.
<s> What!?
<s> Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
<s> No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
<s> What do you want?
<s> Yes.
<s> Why did you agree to come here?
<s> No, she won't.
<s> Yes.
<s> Where's Sartorius?
<s> He'll let me in.
<s> And professionally?
<s> My wife.
<s> Will she come back?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
<s> But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
<s> She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
<s> Just get him to stop.
<s> I love her.
<s> But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
<s> I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
<s> I did too.
<s> I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
<s> He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
<s> Sartorius.
<s> You... she said I didn't love her.
<s> Rheya.
<s> It's all right.
<s> I'm disgusting.
<s> You should have told me.
<s> I want to stop taking those pills.
<s> I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
<s> I'm not Snow.
<s> Hey!  There are crazy people here.
<s> Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
<s> Listen, that was my fault.
<s> Urdu and Hindi.
<s> No kidding.
<s> Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
<s> No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
<s> I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
<s> Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah...
<s> It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
<s> ... I don't want to talk about it...
<s> Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
<s> I don't know Tommy.
<s> I think television's a dangerous thing.
<s> Well, actually, she looks better than that.
<s> No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
<s> It's not your taste.
<s> Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I just sat and listened.
<s> When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
<s> I heard.
<s> I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
<s> What the fuck you doin'?!
<s> I know where everything is.
<s> I don't think she can sing, either.
<s> Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
<s> Let me see.
<s> You stop him?
<s> I know.  I've got one too.
<s> Don't be pitiful.
<s> You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
<s> Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
<s> Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
<s> Can I get a word in edgewise?
<s> I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
<s> Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
<s> Frmpph-yrr.
<s> Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
<s> Thank God.
<s> Do you mind if I come too?
<s> Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
<s> Why?
<s> Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
<s> Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
<s> See?  You big dullard.
<s> Aunt May, what happened?
<s> Let's talk in the hall.
<s> I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
<s> I don't care.  Cretin.
<s> I will finish what I've begun
<s> All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
<s> Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
<s> An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
<s> Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
<s> Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
<s> No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
<s> No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
<s> Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
<s> Plenty.
<s> Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
<s> I don't know anymore.
<s> No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
<s> Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
<s> That's right.
<s> You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
<s> Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
<s> Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
<s> I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
<s> I don't care if they wear galoshes!
<s> Me? What if she don't want me?
<s> You're teasing me again!
<s> Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
<s> It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
<s> Why, sure!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
<s> Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
<s> You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
<s> Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
<s> Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
<s> You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
<s> I called it the last time, didn't I?
<s> You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
<s> Shoot!
<s> Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
<s> Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
<s> And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
<s> The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
<s> Yes, you do!
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
<s> Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
<s> I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
<s> I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
<s> No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
<s> Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
<s> During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
<s> I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
<s> The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
<s> There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
<s> What happened to you?
<s> When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
<s> Yes, yes, it is.
<s> What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
<s> A photon torpedo?
<s> Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
<s> Where are the deflector relays?
<s> What's normal?
<s> No.
<s> Understood. That will be all.
<s> Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
<s> Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
<s> What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
<s> Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
<s> Execute!
<s> He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
<s> Put me on the hailing frequency.
<s> Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
<s> Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
<s> Nothing. As before.
<s> Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
<s> Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
<s> But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
<s> That may be difficult...
<s> We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
<s> Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
<s> Scan for vessels in pursuit!
<s> He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
<s> And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
<s> Much is at stake...
<s> Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
<s> ... A cloaking device?
<s> It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
<s> No, sir, no response.
<s> Welcome home, Jim.
<s> Indisposed, sir.
<s> Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
<s> Who is this?! How dare you --
<s> You should take the Vulcan, too.
<s> I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
<s> Yes...
<s> ... Yes...
<s> ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
<s> Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
<s> Wait!... Wait...
<s> They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
<s> For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
<s> As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
<s> Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
<s> Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
<s> We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
<s> I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
<s> What order? Who's taking Genesis?
<s> Carol!
<s> Is that a poem?
<s> Maybe...
<s> We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
<s> Ssssh!
<s> What's the matter -- ?
<s> <u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
<s> No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
<s> <u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
<s> Visual --
<s> I shall avenge you --
<s> What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
<s> KHAN!
<s> Chekov, who is this man?
<s> Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
<s> I'm going down to the station.
<s> Try the emergency channels...
<s> Spock?
<s> We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
<s> My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
<s> Give the word, Admiral.
<s> Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
<s> She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's all we've got.
<s> ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
<s> Best speed, Scotty...
<s> Uhura, patch me in --
<s> ... No, sir. It has not.
<s> Energize defense fields.
<s> Who?
<s> The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
<s> Visual.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Fine. Just fine.
<s> It'll come back to him.
<s> Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
<s> We've done it before.
<s> What do you think, Spock?
<s> Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
<s> I liked him better before he died.
<s> Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
<s> Acceleration is no longer a constant.
<s> My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
<s> Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
<s> Like what?
<s> That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
<s> Shields, aye.
<s> Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
<s> Implicitly.
<s> See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
<s> It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
<s> Who do you think I am?
<s> They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
<s> A spaceship with a missing man.
<s> What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
<s> All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
<s> The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
<s> Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
<s> Thank you, Spock.
<s> They did, Admiral.
<s> No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
<s> Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
<s> Go, Mr. Sulu.
<s> Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
<s> Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
<s> On speakers.
<s> Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
<s> On screen.
<s> Mr. Scott -- how soon?
<s> Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
<s> The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
<s> Admiral, you'll be trapped!
<s> ... Yes?
<s> ... Are you joking?
<s> Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
<s> When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
<s> You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
<s> My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
<s> Really?
<s> They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
<s> Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
<s> I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet...
<s> If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
<s> ... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
<s> How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
<s> A planet in Federation space...
<s> Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
<s> Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
<s> Do you know how to disable the injector?
<s> Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
<s> They... are in opposite directions, sir...
<s> Do you have everything you need from command?
<s> So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
<s> Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
<s> Options?
<s> On screen.
<s> We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
<s> We're not going anywhere.
<s> Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
<s> No, we're here to... rescue them.
<s> You've not aged a day since then?
<s> Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
<s> Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
<s> Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
<s> Say the greeting again...
<s> ... I believe you...
<s> ... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
<s> Augh?
<s> And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
<s> I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
<s> I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
<s> Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
<s> My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
<s> I believe so.
<s> Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
<s> I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
<s> Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
<s> Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
<s> I have the password right here.
<s> Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
<s> Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
<s> Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
<s> I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
<s> We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
<s> Some.
<s> A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
<s> That's impossible.
<s> On screen.
<s> Fire.
<s> Fire!
<s> We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
<s> Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
<s> Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
<s> What are you suggesting?
<s> There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
<s> That's the question -
<s> We've been set up all along.
<s> We're not finished.
<s> Bones, are you afraid of the future?
<s> Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
<s> If they're even looking for us...
<s> She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
<s> Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
<s> Come on...
<s> And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
<s> The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
<s> They'll make it look like an accident...
<s> I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
<s> You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
<s> How can I trust --
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes.
<s> Your honors, the State rests.
<s> Uhura, monitor!
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
<s> We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
<s> We must do this again soon.
<s> Give a girl a chance, Captain.
<s> Energize...
<s> Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
<s> Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
<s> Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<s> Sir?
<s> I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
<s> We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
<s> They're dying.
<s> We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
<s> He was just about to explain the whole damn -
<s> Why would they give them to us?
<s> Not yet... Section 4236...
<s> WE SURRENDER.
<s> Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
<s> Such things have happened before, sir.
<s> You can't prove any of this...
<s> You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
<s> You having hearing problems, mister?
<s> I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
<s> There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
<s> If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
<s> This one can.
<s> Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
<s> At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
<s> I am in a room with lights.
<s> You're working late.
<s> I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
<s> I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
<s> That was another time.
<s> Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
<s> At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
<s> I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
<s> How could I not?
<s> No!
<s> Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
<s> When this is over, I owe you a drink.
<s> Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
<s> Sir?
<s> Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
<s> What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
<s> Aye, sir
<s> We can only hope so.
<s> When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
<s> I've never met a human woman.
<s> Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
<s> You know I do.
<s> Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
<s> You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
<s> There is that.
<s> I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
<s> I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
<s> But you want to.
<s> On my way.
<s> Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
<s> But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
<s> Should I raise shields?
<s> Do as I tell you!
<s> What?!
<s> She is here.
<s> They will obey, Praetor.
<s> Praetor.
<s> For the moment.
<s> No, we can handle this.
<s> Sure.
<s> I make maps.
<s> Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
<s> We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
<s> We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
<s> We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
<s> You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
<s> Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
<s> Is that what's affecting your performance?
<s> Shermin!! Shermin!!!
<s> X...
<s> No gas.
<s> You'll see.
<s> I know.
<s> Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
<s> No.
<s> Candy.
<s> You want to try it?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> When we get here.
<s> Do you have a baby?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> What?
<s> What is hell?
<s> But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
<s> On the radio they say it's good.
<s> The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
<s> Where did you learn that?
<s> You promised.
<s> Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
<s> What? No, of course not.
<s> Pull over. I've got to get back there.
<s> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
<s> Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
<s> Bullshit!
<s> It could have been anything.
<s> It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
<s> Judy, that's stupid.
<s> I wouldn't think so.
<s> Just not the eyes.
<s> Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
<s> My God.
<s> 'We might as well make the best of it.'
<s> I just got to talk to you for one second.
<s> Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
<s> Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
<s> I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
<s> Least you can do.
<s> I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
<s> Not now... I don't want to think about it--
<s> What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
<s> And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
<s> Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
<s> Who was just here?
<s> Faith, can I talk to you a second?
<s> No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
<s> Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
<s> Black.  Jack.
<s> This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
<s> Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
<s> That's where it gets a little strange.
<s> Now you're really getting paranoid.
<s> No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
<s> Fire's out, isn't it?
<s> I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
<s> Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
<s> How long does it last?  Oh.
<s> Yeah, right, blow it open.
<s> Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
<s> Uh unh.
<s> Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
<s> Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
<s> Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
<s> Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
<s> Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
<s> Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
<s> Hi. What's in the case?
<s> You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
<s> Just an observer.
<s> From the grave?
<s> What I do requires confidentiality.
<s> "Was?"
<s> How long ago?
<s> You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
<s> In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
<s> I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
<s> Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
<s> Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
<s> How long have you been downtown?
<s> They're all criminals?
<s> I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
<s> He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
<s> Because you asked him to, stupid.
<s> I know.
<s> Does Koessler ask about me?
<s> That's true.
<s> What's that?
<s> I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
<s> Jaime? Where are you?
<s> Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
<s> I'm going to Amarillo.
<s> I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
<s> The little piggie speaks.
<s> I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
<s> He's moved on to TV.
<s> Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
<s> [You tell me.]
<s> Four hundred and sixty, sir.
<s> I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
<s> 350 miles.
<s> You're right. I know.
<s> It didn't feel that way.
<s> Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
<s> No. Stop, come on.
<s> Shut up.
<s> You're money, baby.
<s> I'd say about two weeks.
<s> You better pay the man.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yes. Like the quiche.
<s> Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
<s> What what? What advantages?
<s> What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
<s> Anything.
<s> Oh. You know.
<s> Why not? This place is dead anyway.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> No...
<s> Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
<s> Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
<s> ...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
<s> Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
<s> Hey man, don't sweat it.
<s> Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
<s> I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
<s> Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
<s> ...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
<s> Go for it, man.
<s> Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
<s> You always know the right thing to say.
<s> Give me the money. I'll get it.
<s> I can't believe you.
<s> What are they doing here?
<s> Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
<s> Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
<s> Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
<s> We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
<s> Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
<s> Did she, or did she not smile?
<s> We're gonna get laid, baby.
<s> Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
<s> You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
<s> Let's just leave.
<s> Let's go.
<s> What an asshole.
<s> You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
<s> Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
<s> It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
<s> Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
<s> "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
<s> We didn't do so bad after all.
<s> Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
<s> You didn't have to get into it, baby.
<s> Michelle went for you, right.
<s> How?
<s> Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
<s> You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
<s> See? And what does this guy she's with do?
<s> Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
<s> What? That was the best part of the old game.
<s> ...through the kitchen...
<s> What a surprise.
<s> No...
<s> Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
<s> Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
<s> No.
<s> Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
<s> ...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
<s> ...you're money...
<s> Now go over there and get those digits.
<s> ...it is so on.
<s> What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
<s> Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
<s> Ba Fa Goulle.
<s> Like hell I will.
<s> No, just you and Paulie.
<s> Understood.
<s> How bad will it be?
<s> Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
<s> And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
<s> It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
<s> And with prison record.
<s> It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
<s> For killing a man.
<s> I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
<s> The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
<s> Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
<s> OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
<s> And when they shot me father...
<s> Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
<s> For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
<s> Please say it.
<s> OK. 
<s> How's Mom?
<s> I can help you out...
<s> I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
<s> I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
<s> Maybe.
<s> I do renounce him.
<s> Be patient.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
<s> Do you recognize my voice?
<s> Is that good?
<s> Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
<s> Can you mix a martini?
<s> That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
<s> What? What's this?
<s> What?
<s> I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
<s> What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
<s> You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
<s> See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
<s> Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
<s> Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
<s> Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
<s> Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
<s> You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
<s> Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
<s> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
<s> Tom, I don't love you.
<s> I just don't believe that!
<s> Such as?
<s> Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
<s> Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
<s> I hope she never knows.
<s> What's going on?
<s> He's not a man, he's a god.
<s> So I'm learning.
<s> I'll go and see what's the matter.
<s> Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
<s> No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
<s> We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
<s> What?
<s> Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
<s> What are you going to do now, Tom?
<s> I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
<s> Emily.  Just kidding.
<s> As in the...?
<s> What?
<s> How did you know that?
<s> You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
<s> Hello Meredith.
<s> Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
<s> I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
<s> They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
<s> What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
<s> Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
<s> Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
<s> It's okay.
<s> Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
<s> I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
<s> Of course. What happened to your face?
<s> November, I thought.
<s> And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
<s> May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
<s> Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
<s> I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
<s> He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
<s> Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure.
<s> The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
<s> More people watch it.
<s> No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
<s> With the other hand, right?
<s> That's a dollar forty-seven.
<s> A real skunk.
<s> We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
<s> For a fee.
<s> A girl needs protection.
<s> It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
<s> It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
<s> Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
<s> I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
<s> Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
<s> What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
<s> Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
<s> Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
<s> I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
<s> You want to work uptown nights?
<s> Oh?
<s> Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
<s> I'm no cop.  I want some action.
<s> What's going on?
<s> That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
<s> Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
<s> What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
<s> I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
<s> Partners.
<s> And  I love you, Pete!
<s> I had it, a minute ago...
<s> No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh.
<s> You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
<s> Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
<s> Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
<s> Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
<s> I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
<s> Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
<s> I do.
<s> I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
<s> Well, son, you're home!
<s> Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
<s> Or the Bijou.  Either one.
<s> Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
<s> Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
<s> Vultures...
<s> It's possible.  I just don't remember.
<s> I was decorated.
<s> Why not?
<s> "Ashes To Ashes?"
<s> It's wrong, Leo.
<s> Not any more.
<s> I taught you that.
<s> Oh.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What exactly did you hear?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
<s> The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
<s> They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
<s> No, not really.
<s> It's a lovely garden.
<s> Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
<s> Yes.
<s> Lovebirds.
<s> All right. 
<s> Where are you from originally, Annie?
<s> Because she was afraid.
<s> Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
<s> Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
<s> No!
<s> They're birds!
<s> Take them.
<s> Oh, I suppose so.
<s> It's Alice.
<s> Morning.
<s> Yep.
<s> Right here. Bodega Bay.
<s> Yes?
<s> Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> Yep?
<s> The little Brenner girl?
<s> Impossible.
<s> Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
<s> What happened?
<s> They're back!
<s> No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
<s> No. Here's fine. 
<s> For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
<s> ...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
<s> I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
<s> I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
<s> I told you. We met yesterday.
<s> Mother?
<s> I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
<s> I started to say... inside...
<s> I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
<s> Why, Mrs. Brenner?
<s> What are we going to do about it, Al?
<s> All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
<s> About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
<s> As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
<s> Aren't these lovebirds?
<s> Are they moulting now?
<s> I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
<s> That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
<s> Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
<s> I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
<s> No, San Francisco. What are you...?
<s> It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
<s> Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
<s> I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
<s> No.
<s> It is for me.
<s> What do you want ?
<s> No, tell me.
<s> Mmm?
<s> It was like that yesterday.
<s> The bay doesn't.
<s> Almost two a.m.
<s> No... wait.  Hold me.
<s> And he'll talk?
<s> Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
<s> How soon?
<s> Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
<s> Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
<s> No one called it a war!
<s> I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
<s> Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
<s> Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
<s> How?
<s> With smoke.
<s> That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
<s> Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
<s> I want you to help my little girl.
<s> Yes.
<s> You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
<s> Aye.
<s> Come in, boy -- come in.
<s> Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
<s> They'll be thinking of that, too.
<s> It was a woman when we put her in.
<s> One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
<s> Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
<s> You will not have it?
<s> I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
<s> You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
<s> What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
<s> Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
<s> Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
<s> I take no gifts from you.
<s> So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
<s> Would you bribe me to leave you be?
<s> I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
<s> Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
<s> Aye --
<s> You sent them. I had no choice.
<s> We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
<s> I think we should get some support?
<s> Good thing in a situation like this.
<s> How can you die if you're already dead?
<s> He didn't kill her.
<s> I told you, I knew your sister.
<s> It's not. I can't take it.
<s> Could say that.
<s> He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
<s> Doubt is a motherfucker.
<s> You mean Alex.
<s> What did I say?
<s> Just hold on to me.
<s> Honey. I just can't.
<s> The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
<s> About you.
<s> I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
<s> Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
<s> Yes -- that is true.
<s> These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
<s> We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
<s> I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
<s> Yes.
<s> That can easily be arranged.
<s> I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
<s> No -- I'm afraid not.
<s> Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
<s> It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
<s> Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
<s> Mr. Brady's a cop.
<s> He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
<s> He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
<s> About 250 million of your miles.
<s> From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
<s> I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
<s> Thank you... Have you any news?
<s> Is it real?
<s> I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
<s> You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
<s> That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
<s> But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
<s> Is that what you're thinking about?
<s> I don't care about the rest of the world!
<s> I enjoyed every minute of it.
<s> Goodnight, my dear.
<s> Yes--?
<s> Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
<s> Remember those words.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> He'll catch on to it in no time now.
<s> We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
<s> You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
<s> That's right.
<s> They would have killed this man?
<s> How long will that take?
<s> No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
<s> This one could save your life.
<s> You better get some fresh air.
<s> You gotta drive!
<s> Time to activate Plan B.
<s> Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<s> Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
<s> Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
<s> Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
<s> What?
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
<s> For what.
<s> No.  I'm up.
<s> I'm tired now.
<s> Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
<s> I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
<s> You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
<s> It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
<s> Star.
<s> Okay.
<s> Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
<s> I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
<s> Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
<s> Okay.
<s> Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
<s> I was here first.
<s> Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
<s> You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
<s> What would that make Mom?
<s> Don't bother.
<s> He was protecting <u>you</u>!
<s> Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
<s> Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Anybody sick?
<s> Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
<s> No.  Just let him freeze out there.
<s> Cut him loose?
<s> But...
<s> We got morphine, don't we.
<s> What?
<s> Then I'll have to kill you.
<s> I guess I'm the only one.
<s> Damn you, MacReady!
<s> Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
<s> What are you talking?!  He's had two months training in those choppers!
<s> You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
<s> We going to make it?
<s> The generator!
<s> Who else could have used that key?
<s> What else can they do?
<s> What kind of stories?
<s> Last night.
<s> It was meant to.
<s> This is the way in?
<s> Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
<s> How do you control the Morlocks?
<s> We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
<s> When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
<s> Because...
<s> I -- what are you?!
<s> Got here as soon as I could.
<s> And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
<s> Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
<s> What?
<s> That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
<s> Oh?
<s> I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
<s> Why don't you come to our house instead?
<s> Good night, Alex.
<s> Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
<s> Good night.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
<s> What are you?
<s> So you can use it now?
<s> For our sake, I hope not.
<s> I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
<s> That wasn't a fucking restraint.
<s> I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
<s> That's too bad.
<s> I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
<s> I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
<s> I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
<s> Sure.
<s> You two ok?
<s> Yeah, but I don't know what.
<s> Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
<s> [Beat] What?
<s> How?
<s> If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
<s> I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
<s> It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
<s> Ok. Ssh. Rest.
<s> I'm doing fine.
<s> So it's helping?
<s> I was working with a boy named Eugene.
<s> How do you know about Dr. Becker?
<s> Listen to me. That's all I ask.
<s> Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
<s> I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
<s> No.
<s> Sure.
<s> Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
<s> My Lord.
<s> Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
<s> What's wrong?
<s> What for?
<s> Shut up.
<s> Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
<s> Who's your friend?
<s> Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
<s> I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
<s> No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
<s> Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
<s> Why now, Jimmy?
<s> I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
<s> Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
<s> What kind of stuff do I bring?
<s> Okay.  I will, too.
<s> How come he let you go?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Ready when you are.
<s> Get the car!
<s> Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
<s> Give me the keys.
<s> Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
<s> I won't wait up.
<s> You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
<s> Lemme see the map.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
<s> I can see that.
<s> Gosh.  It sure is.
<s> ... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
<s> Shoot the radio!
<s> Just asking.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
<s> It'd have to be pretty good.
<s> And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
<s> Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
<s> Unbearable, I'd imagine.
<s> It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
<s> We're not giving up, Thelma.
<s> Fresno.
<s> Jeez, I didn't catch it.
<s> Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
<s> Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
<s> Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
<s> I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
<s> They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
<s> Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
<s> Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
<s> What?
<s> Huh? But why did Healy?
<s> Jesus Christ you're right.
<s> You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
<s> Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
<s> Big time.
<s> Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
<s> Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
<s> You found my car?!
<s> Dumbshit.
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You own a home there?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
<s> Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
<s> What?
<s> Forget it. It was... fun.
<s> We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
<s> You can't be serious.
<s> I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
<s> I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
<s> Oh my.
<s> You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
<s> Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
<s> Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
<s> I said buttplug. She's heinous.
<s> What?! You're calling me a stalker?
<s> Your turn?
<s> Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
<s> Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
<s> Who?
<s> You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
<s> How'd you manage that one?
<s> No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
<s> 'That right? Good for you.
<s> Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
<s> Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
<s> Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
<s> Healy.
<s> I appreciate you looking out for me.
<s> Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
<s> You mean he's not a criminal?
<s> Oh Jesus...
<s> Thanks a lot, Ted.
<s> Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
<s> Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
<s> That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
<s> I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
<s> Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
<s> Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
<s> It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
<s> No, that's really unneces --
<s> Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
<s> McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
<s> You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
<s> You can't take him out this late in the game.
<s> Then they should speak up.
<s> So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
<s> And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
<s> Still heading for Cuba.
<s> We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
<s> I'll be evacuated with the President.
<s> Busy. But you've got his heart.
<s> Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
<s> Not as far as the election goes.
<s> Good.
<s> Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
<s> No way.
<s> You're scared to cancel on Daly.
<s> I'm gonna protect those pilots.
<s> Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
<s> Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
<s> Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
<s> Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
<s> I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
<s> Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
<s> FBI? What you investigatin'?
<s> Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
<s> -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
<s> Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
<s> It ain't Geronimo.
<s> I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
<s> His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
<s> -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
<s> Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
<s> Why?
<s> You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
<s> We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
<s> No way, Cooch.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
<s> Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
<s> He knows me?
<s> Why should I tell you.
<s> He also said "listen to the water."
<s> Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
<s> Crow Horse, listen --
<s> Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
<s> What?
<s> If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
<s> Move it, Magdelana.
<s> I read, Cooch.
<s> Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
<s> Leavenworth a tough joint?
<s> Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
<s> Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> Used to what?
<s> You're an animal.
<s> It's not suffering anymore.
<s> They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
<s> Are you really that brave?
<s> And now?
<s> I'm still second best.
<s> I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
<s> That's what I want.
<s> What truth?
<s> Who's gonna win?
<s> Right on the flight line?
<s> Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
<s> I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
<s> NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
<s> You're crazy. We're level.
<s> You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
<s> We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
<s> You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
<s> DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
<s> What are you talking about, we gotta go!
<s> You go. I'm staying with it.
<s> We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
<s> Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
<s> What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
<s> I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
<s> The girl with the purple fingernails?
<s> FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
<s> NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
<s> I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
<s> Tell me one thing.
<s> Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
<s> I lost.
<s> I know.
<s> Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
<s> Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
<s> Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
<s> Why not?
<s> And you get a kickback.
<s> May I use your pen?
<s> Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
<s> Sorry.  Too perfect.
<s> Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
<s> It's about goddamn time.
<s> Looks like another schizoid embolism.
<s> Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
<s> That's right.
<s> Swallow this.
<s> It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
<s> O.K., everybody pull out!
<s> Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
<s> C'mon!
<s> "RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
<s> Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
<s> You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
<s> What is it?
<s> Up!
<s> Mmmm.....
<s> But I'm always home by morning.
<s> Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
<s> Just think about it.
<s> Lori, move.
<s> What did they do to you?  Tell me!
<s> I'm here at Rekall.
<s> I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
<s> How real does it seem?
<s> Come on, don't bullshit me.
<s> You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
<s> Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
<s> If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
<s> I saw them.
<s> Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
<s> I gave you?
<s> Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
<s> In a minute.
<s> The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
<s> Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
<s> Hell you did.  Your turn.
<s> I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
<s> Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
<s> I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
<s> We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
<s> Adios, bridge!
<s> He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
<s> What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
<s> Fifteen lousy bucks.
<s> Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
<s> Little sons of bitches.
<s> I think we wait right here.
<s> Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
<s> Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
<s> Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
<s> Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
<s> It's...gone...!
<s> Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
<s> Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
<s> He was your snitch.
<s> True.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
<s> The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
<s> I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
<s> I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
<s> Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
<s> Not at all --
<s> -- Remember?
<s> -- You found his mugshot?
<s> -- Yeah?
<s> Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
<s> That's why I hate experts.
<s> Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
<s> You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
<s> Neither.
<s> I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
<s> A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
<s> I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
<s> I don't need sleep!
<s> Maybe... because someone's afraid.
<s> It's okay, Eddie.
<s> For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
<s> See-cil.
<s> Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
<s> It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
<s> I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
<s> We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
<s> The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
<s> The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
<s> Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
<s> And who was Arturo Esparza?
<s> I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
<s> No? Then what did he say?
<s> -- Eddie told you?
<s> I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
<s> -- Roger --
<s> Yeah, we do some of that.
<s> I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
<s> ...A soldado, he takes care of it.
<s> A woman.
<s> Blonde.
<s> She is preparing a great abundance of food.
<s> NO! GOD, NO...
<s> Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
<s> Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
<s> That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
<s> A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
<s> Was there an argument?
<s> CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
<s> YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
<s> What?
<s> Did she ever mention any friends?
<s> Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
<s> He talks loud. And he loves his code.
<s> I don't know, Sam.
<s> We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
<s> In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
<s> May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
<s> Faulty wiring.
<s> Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
<s> I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
<s> Sure. What do you want me to call you?
<s> Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
<s> No, you should forget about last night.
<s> Yep...  Yes...  It is.
<s> Who would do that?
<s> Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
<s> No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
<s> How can I be together if I'm not together?
<s> I can't tonight.
<s> I just can't, James. I can't do it.
<s> What were you doing in my room?
<s> Good night, sweetheart.
<s> ...school's fine...
<s> Dad...
<s> A friend from school.
<s> You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
<s> Stay away from me.
<s> NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
<s> They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
<s> Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
<s> Nothing, I chickened out.
<s> There's no one here.
<s> If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
<s> How did you settle on the amount?
<s> You thought it was just.
<s> Gruber...
<s> Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
<s> I...
<s> 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
<s> You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
<s> I thought I would need it.
<s> After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
<s> I'm just an M.D.
<s> ...I was one of a group of...
<s> Yes.
<s> When she...
<s> Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
<s> What did these people do when her heart stopped?
<s> She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
<s> Yes!
<s> You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
<s> That's what I'd planned to...
<s> Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
<s> Well...
<s> I. Yes. It is.
<s> She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
<s> Yes? Galvin, right?
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> ...that's perfectly all right.
<s> You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> This is a complicated case, your Honor...
<s> ...things change.
<s> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
<s> And what are you? A cop?
<s> Who says I'm the one that called it off?
<s> Maybe what?
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> You're talking like a drunk.
<s> You, you don't under...
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> No.
<s> And ask me what?
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
<s> Dr. Gruber's not in.
<s> Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
<s> ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
<s> That's for sure, Frank.
<s> Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
<s> ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
<s> Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
<s> D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> Read me what she said.
<s> Yes.
<s> We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
<s> Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
<s> Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
<s> Can you handle one of these?
<s> Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
<s> Hours.  I've been so scared...!
<s> I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
<s> I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
<s> If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
<s> Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
<s> Yes, but...
<s> Chase...
<s> Maybe you should tell me your dream.
<s> I'll be there in three hours.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> He was just here!
<s> He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
<s> They were safe and could sleep.
<s> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<s> Not sleepy.
<s> Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
<s> Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
<s> Yes.
<s> Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
<s> They wouldn't let me...
<s> It can be captured, sometimes.
<s> Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
<s> That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
<s> Choice?  What kind of choice?
<s> We were idealists.
<s> Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
<s> Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
<s> I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
<s> It's not a vacation, it's private school.
<s> Nobody says you have to be like me.
<s> You don't give him enough credit Chas.
<s> I guess.
<s> I gotta go.
<s> Yes.
<s> I can't watch this.
<s> How do you know?  They might.
<s> Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
<s> He killed the dolphin.
<s> He's a big boy.
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> It has nothing to do with him.
<s> It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
<s> Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
<s> We'll think of something.
<s> Why'd you jump?
<s> Shut up donut.
<s> You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
<s> What is it... the secret?
<s> If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
<s> It seems we're short on singers.
<s> What's that?
<s> The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
<s> The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
<s> ... Absolutely not.
<s> Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
<s> How old are you?
<s> You black?
<s> She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
<s> Used to.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Muchas gracias.
<s> If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
<s> He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
<s> Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
<s> Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
<s> See ya downstairs.
<s> How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
<s> Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
<s> Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
<s> Peanut...
<s> Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
<s> And you never told nobody about it?
<s> That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
<s> What happened to him?
<s> You mean like pedal pushers?
<s> What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
<s> It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
<s> Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
<s> Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
<s> Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
<s> Where?
<s> I'm goin'.
<s> Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
<s> You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
<s> I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
<s> I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
<s> I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
<s> It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
<s> He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
<s> You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
<s> You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
<s> I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
<s> That's not why I called.
<s> Lula's gone off with Sailor.
<s> I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
<s> Yes.
<s> I want you to get rid of Sailor.
<s> Shoot him.
<s> No.
<s> Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
<s> Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
<s> It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
<s> I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
<s> You heard right.
<s> Life is unpredictable.
<s> The candelabras were my Gran's.
<s> She's a transvestite.
<s> She left me. Crabs.
<s> Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
<s> I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
<s> Hit your brakes.
<s> Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
<s> My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
<s> Call it a hunch.
<s> That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
<s> How long have you been smoking marijuana?
<s> So is my friend... is Sara still here?
<s> You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
<s> Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
<s> It's colder in there.
<s> Heaven?
<s> I'll miss my bus.
<s> Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
<s> He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
<s> You?
<s> Miss Sloviak's.
<s> No thanks. I'm fine without them.
<s> What's he saying?
<s> Sure.
<s> Who?
<s> What'd he say?
<s> Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
<s> Hm.
<s> No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
<s> Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
<s> I don't know...  Me.
<s> Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
<s> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
<s> Amazing.
<s> Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
<s> You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
<s> Because of my coat?
<s> I don't know... 'Episodes.'
<s> James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
<s> I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
<s> Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
<s> I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
<s> Just checking.
<s> Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
<s> Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
<s> The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
<s> I got the message you called too.
<s> She's left before...
<s> She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
<s> No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
<s> Caps.
<s> Really? That was fast.
<s> It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
<s> Inside.
<s> I think I might've said I was in love with you.
<s> He told me.
<s> I said it didn't sound like you.
<s> And you're old.
<s> I told Walter.
<s> Why yes. How did you know?
<s> Tony. Now that I'm home.
<s> This is important.
<s> Oh... yeah.
<s> I don't know. It might be...
<s> Taking the long way home.
<s> As a heart attack.
<s> Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
<s> I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
<s> Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
<s> Beautiful. How's business?
<s> I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
<s> Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
<s> Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
<s> Carlos, I never raped a woman.
<s> Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
<s> Birds.
<s> Why not?
<s> Their sound is quite musical.
<s> It's my bird book.
<s> You going to take me on a nature walk?
<s> I went to bed around seven.
<s> It's a free country, isn't it?
<s> I count my blessings.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Can I ask how old you are?
<s> How come?
<s> I said the job is okay.
<s> That was a joke.
<s> No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
<s> Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
<s> I'm still thinking about it.
<s> Forget it.
<s> I don't need someone else.
<s> You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
<s> I suppose it's however society defines it.
<s> I don't.
<s> What is your idea of being normal?
<s> That's my answer.
<s> What?
<s> In my bedroom, sleeping.
<s> In my bed too.
<s> Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
<s> Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
<s> Accept you?
<s> I'm just quiet.
<s> I thought you were a dyke.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I'll buy a plant.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> It's been a while since...
<s> The morning?
<s> What did you do to them?
<s> Sounds like a special guy.
<s> No. That's what I used to tell myself.
<s> What?
<s> Which brother did this?
<s> No you don't.
<s> You never asked them about it?
<s> What?
<s> I'm not scared.
<s> Do what?
<s> What's your fucking problem?
<s> Do you want to talk about it?
<s> There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
<s> No way that could just be seawater.
<s> I'm alright, I'm dealing.
<s> Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
<s> Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
<s> Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
<s> I'm switching off now.
<s> Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
<s> No.
<s> His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
<s> Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
<s> Now what?
<s> You noticed.
<s> I don't know, look around.
<s> Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
<s> No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
<s> Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
<s> I can't afford slack, Brigman.
<s> That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
<s> Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
<s> Got it. Over.
<s> We're here now.  Let's get her done.
<s> You watch yourself.
<s> Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
<s> Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
<s> Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
<s> He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
<s> What kind of luminous things, Bud?
<s> Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
<s> There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
<s> Four or five days.
<s> To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
<s> You already know what they are.
<s> More so than the shark?
<s> Yes, very much so.
<s> I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
<s> But why, Claudia?... Why?
<s> What! Get married?
<s> You say that just to flatter me.
<s> But then why did you bother changing?
<s> Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
<s> More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
<s> But why all nudes?
<s> Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
<s> Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
<s> I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
<s> Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
<s> This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
<s> What is it?
<s> I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
<s> Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
<s> Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
<s> I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
<s> No. The owners are in Australia.
<s> What boat?
<s> Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
<s> What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
<s> Why?
<s> One of the other Sisters?
<s> He loves you the way you are.
<s> That's not what he meant.
<s> In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
<s> I burnt them.
<s> They were stained.
<s> I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
<s> Oh, yes!
<s> Where?
<s> And what did you do?
<s> Where'd it come from before that?
<s> Agnes...
<s> Not at the moment, no.
<s> No... do you?
<s> She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
<s> Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
<s> Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
<s> She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
<s> Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
<s> She can.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> Doctor Livingston.
<s> To help me.
<s> Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
<s> I hate them.
<s> I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
<s> What do you do?
<s> I don't know which one 
<s> Go away, I don't want you here.
<s> No... don't hit me please...
<s> Why?
<s> Where?
<s> So she sent you?
<s> Yes.
<s> And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
<s> Thanks...
<s> I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
<s> You got to be crazy.
<s> If I find anything I'll call you.
<s> Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
<s> It's gone on long enough. You're out.
<s> Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
<s> She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
<s> Yes, but I...
<s> Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
<s> Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
<s> The science of psychiatry.
<s> From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
<s> How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
<s> And in your eyes?
<s> How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
<s> No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
<s> I knew that after the fact.
<s> You just said...
<s> Stupid woman... and that's all?
<s> And what has that to do with it?
<s> Hand rolled.
<s> Oh, you've come a long way baby.
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> How  ?
<s> That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
<s> That's a lie.
<s> No!
<s> Then she's a liar.
<s> Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
<s> Eh?
<s> They are?
<s> Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
<s> Y'what?
<s> Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
<s> Ah ... a shamus, eh?
<s> I've made the scene.
<s> You do - repeatedly.
<s> But I won't.
<s> He's sulking again.
<s> Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
<s> What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
<s> Come here.
<s> Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
<s> Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
<s> I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
<s> Parading?
<s> Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
<s> Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
<s> I'm going parading before it's too late!
<s> What's he on about?
<s> I'll look after meself.
<s> But I'm clean.
<s> It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
<s> Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
<s> Foreign devil ...
<s> Can't he? He's done it, son!
<s> He started it.
<s> It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
<s> Sit down, the lot of you.
<s> Aye, let's try the dressing room.
<s> Tonight? We can't make it ...
<s> What?
<s> I'm not, no.
<s> Y'what?
<s> Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
<s> I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
<s> It's not my fault.
<s> Oh, down the ... er ...?
<s> Oh, anything you say, Paul.
<s> A proper Aborigine.
<s> Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
<s> Where the hell are we?
<s> Take a look.
<s> God I'm hungry.
<s> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<s> Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
<s> What?  <u>Why</u>?
<s> The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
<s> It grows on you.
<s> It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
<s> Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
<s> The water will still recycle.
<s> We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
<s> Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
<s> Ask him.
<s> Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
<s> Can you do anything for him?
<s> Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
<s> Don't be an idiot.
<s> The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
<s> That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
<s> Good!  That's good!
<s> I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
<s> I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
<s> Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
<s> We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
<s> We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
<s> And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
<s> Close...
<s> Any microorganisms?
<s> Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
<s> Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
<s> Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
<s> Is that its mouth?
<s> You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
<s> Go ahead, Jay.
<s> By eating our food supplies.
<s> So the next step should be --
<s> That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
<s> Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
<s> What can I do?
<s> It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> We're what!?
<s> Too many.
<s> Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
<s> Shit.  When?
<s> The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
<s> We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
<s> But...
<s> I dunno.
<s> Couple more seconds!
<s> What?  Why?
<s> Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
<s> Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
<s> I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
<s> Is that a fact.
<s> Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
<s> I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
<s> What can I do?
<s> Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
<s> It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
<s> Yes. The Shubert.
<s> Just like that.
<s> It wasn't meant to be.
<s> That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
<s> It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
<s> You have no right to say such things!
<s> - it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
<s> Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
<s> Why not?
<s> Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
<s> We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
<s> Hear, hear...
<s> Eve! My understudy...
<s> I take it she read well.
<s> I'm a junk yard.
<s> - in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
<s> What?
<s> Cut it out.
<s> I don't think that's funny!
<s> Nothing, really...
<s> I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
<s> You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
<s> Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
<s> You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
<s> What a body, what a voice.
<s> I'm trying terribly hard.
<s> Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
<s> You know what I'm going to be?
<s> I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
<s> It's only one picture deal.
<s> You didn't have to tell me.
<s> From what would I be running?
<s> I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
<s> Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
<s> I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
<s> But she just got here...
<s> What did you expect - live sables?
<s> They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
<s> See you home...
<s> Well?
<s> Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
<s> That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> Why should you think I wouldn't be?
<s> But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
<s> I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
<s> Karen.
<s> "Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
<s> Well, you've done so much... what's new?
<s> Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
<s> I wouldn't like.
<s> Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
<s> Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
<s> It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
<s> Roughly ten minutes.
<s> More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
<s> Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
<s> Well...
<s> That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
<s> Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
<s> - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
<s> Eve?
<s> I'm trying hard to follow you.
<s> Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
<s> Now just a minute-
<s> The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
<s> Not much.
<s> Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
<s> I will.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> She was a revelation...
<s> That's beside the point.
<s> Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
<s> I have no intention of having an accident!
<s> Too bad.
<s> Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
<s> It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
<s> How about me what?
<s> I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
<s> Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
<s> An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
<s> But what could she do?
<s> Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
<s> Answer my question!
<s> Hmm.
<s> We need a sympathetic face.
<s> Why didn't we get that?
<s> --you do?--with access to records?
<s> I never scared anyone before.
<s> We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
<s> It's safe, try it, you'll see.
<s> Go on, go on--
<s> --Colson.
<s> How high up, which Republicans?
<s> Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
<s> Goddamnit!--
<s> --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
<s> Night.
<s> I'm so glad.
<s> I've got a lot of energy.
<s> Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
<s> I didn't.
<s> When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
<s> We've just been talking to Young--
<s> --Deep Throat?--
<s> We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
<s> --right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
<s> ...No... never in so many words...
<s> 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> To cover up?
<s> Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
<s> So?
<s> I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
<s> Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
<s> Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
<s> --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
<s> You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
<s> ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
<s> I think so.
<s> --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
<s> --well, Sloan--
<s> Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
<s> I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
<s> Haldeman.  Right?
<s> Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
<s> The what to what?
<s> Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
<s> Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
<s> You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
<s> Charming.
<s> First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
<s> No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
<s> You called me Oz.
<s> I know, it sucks!
<s> Yeah right.
<s> But that one time --
<s> Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
<s> No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
<s> I don't get it, that really works?
<s> Uh...
<s> Nothing, I just hugged her back.
<s> No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
<s> Sorry, I thought you were dead.
<s> Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
<s> It's not what it looks like!
<s> C-Span?
<s> "Fun loving" -- insane.
<s> Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
<s> So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
<s> Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
<s> Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
<s> Me?
<s> Oh no.
<s> This just got a hell of a lot better.
<s> Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
<s> Okay, don't stop.
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
<s> I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
<s> Me too.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, the time went by so fast.
<s> Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
<s> What's that?
<s> Oh shit dude, the L-word!
<s> Then where does a blowjob figure in?
<s> This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
<s> Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
<s> I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
<s> Doing what?
<s> Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
<s> What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
<s> No it isn't! You're dead!
<s> What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
<s> Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
<s> In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
<s> Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
<s> So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
<s> I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
<s> I couldn't do it. Not to you.
<s> Shit!
<s> My uncle's in a coma you moron!
<s> This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
<s> Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
<s> That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
<s> That's McDermott, but yeah.
<s> I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
<s> Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
<s> I told you. These murders are not normal.
<s> How to read.
<s> Well, I don't have any money . . .
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Yes, your highness.
<s> You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
<s> This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
<s> You'd lose your security deposit?
<s> Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
<s> We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
<s> Ah! Let us begin!
<s> She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
<s> You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
<s> Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
<s> No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
<s> This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
<s> What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
<s> If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
<s> Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
<s> I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
<s> M'm.
<s> Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
<s> Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
<s> Wisconsin.
<s> Well, where is it? I-
<s> Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
<s> Fifteen years, yeah.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
<s> No, so help me.
<s> you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
<s> No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
<s> Oh.
<s> As Balzac said...
<s> No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
<s> M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
<s> M'hm.
<s> Yeah.
<s> M'hm.
<s> Do I love you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
<s> I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
<s> 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
<s> No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
<s> I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
<s> so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
<s> Are yuh?
<s> Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
<s> No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
<s> I didn't follow you!
<s> Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
<s> That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
<s> I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
<s> Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
<s> My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
<s> I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
<s> Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
<s> I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
<s> All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
<s> Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
<s> And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
<s> Nothing at all?
<s> No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
<s> You're mad, aren't you?
<s> Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
<s> Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
<s> Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
<s> No jokes-these are friends, okay?
<s> The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
<s> He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
<s> I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
<s> What are you depressed about?
<s> I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
<s> ...as opposed to a print...
<s> Oh, do yuh?
<s> Hey.
<s> Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
<s> I don't know, I mean, I-
<s> V.P.L.?
<s> And... uh-
<s> You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
<s> Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
<s> Then there was Jerry, the actor.
<s> I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
<s> We really had a good time.
<s> Oh, yes, yes.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
<s> A long time.
<s> Why didn't you come in?
<s> The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
<s> Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
<s> I'm in mourning.
<s> He's allergic.
<s> To dander.  Otis.
<s> Didn't I say?
<s> Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
<s> Why would she care?
<s> Really?
<s> With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
<s> He's not going tonight.
<s> Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
<s> Sally?
<s> I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
<s> Lucy overdosed.
<s> Monica.
<s> Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
<s> Hm.  We should do it again.
<s> I adore him.
<s> I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
<s> We couldn't be on more solid ground.
<s> Hardly...
<s> They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
<s> Who'd like to go and find Otis?
<s> Panes is not on your team anymore.
<s> Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
<s> Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
<s> Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
<s> He'll find his way back.
<s> Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
<s> That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
<s> Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
<s> It's a novel.
<s> Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
<s> Don't do this!
<s> You're not ready.
<s> I have no idea who you are.
<s> Okay.
<s> I guess.
<s> It's a Calder.
<s> Will you make love with me?
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
<s> But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
<s> Ah there's our snookums now.
<s> God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
<s> I meant Sally.
<s> You're an interior decorator, right?
<s> Hm.
<s> Very well put.
<s> Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
<s> I think he's really angry with me too.
<s> I like you.
<s> Not good.
<s> I'm sure you understand.
<s> There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
<s> God willing.
<s> Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
<s> You fucking cow, can't you read?!
<s> Not at all.
<s> No, never.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
<s> If he were still alive, maybe.
<s> Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
<s> She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
<s> No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
<s> I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
<s> No.  Not something new.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
<s> What are they?
<s> And here they are!
<s> Would you like to meet my husband?
<s> Oh Soph...
<s> Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
<s> Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
<s> Divinely?
<s> SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
<s> Climb up that tree and get a better view!
<s> Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
<s> Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
<s> Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<s> Hlllllllp!
<s> Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
<s> Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
<s> Superior numbers, kid!
<s> Barbatus?
<s> Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
<s> Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
<s> Oh, no, sir!
<s> Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
<s> Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
<s> Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
<s> Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
<s> Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
<s> Why are we so successful?
<s> But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
<s> I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
<s> Under the mat? 
<s> Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
<s> Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
<s> Sheldrake?
<s> Shall we say -- a dollar?
<s> Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
<s> Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
<s> Just tell 'em -- now and then.
<s> What time does the show go on?
<s> Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
<s> Oh.
<s> Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
<s> No -- I like it.
<s> Why?
<s> The mirror -- it's broken.
<s> Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
<s> Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
<s> No -- I don't want anything.
<s> In his apartment.
<s> They had to pump it out.
<s> I'm not very good at it.
<s> Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
<s> So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
<s> Was he really upset when you told him?
<s> You bet. I got a terrific hand.
<s> Sure.
<s> So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
<s> Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
<s> I don't want to talk to him.
<s> Are you supposed to?
<s> It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
<s> A what?
<s> It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
<s> Cheers.
<s> The dishes?
<s> Fine. How's your eye?
<s> You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
<s> For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
<s> Good night, Miss Kubelik.
<s> Gas?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That's right, Baxter.
<s> Oh, you don't have to worry --
<s> I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
<s> Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
<s> I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
<s> I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
<s> That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
<s> Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
<s> Now what was your news, Baxter?
<s> I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
<s> You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
<s> That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
<s> Yes?
<s> Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
<s> Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
<s> What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
<s> Now will you get out?
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
<s> And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
<s> Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
<s> Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
<s> Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
<s> Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
<s> How many pills were in that bottle?
<s> Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure, Doc.
<s> Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
<s> Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
<s> She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
<s> Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
<s> Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
<s> A.W.O.L.?
<s> Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
<s> Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
<s> Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
<s> We talked about a lot of things.
<s> They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
<s> I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
<s> Baxter?
<s> A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
<s> She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
<s> You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
<s> I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
<s> I said I like all of them.
<s> My men --
<s> That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
<s> Esprit de corps --
<s> I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
<s> I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
<s> Sure, thanks.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Fat. That's real fat.
<s> We do.
<s> A long time.
<s> Who are you ?
<s> He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
<s> I don't believe you --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> I know.
<s> Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
<s> I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
<s> All right I got a little surprise for you --
<s> We're Americans.
<s> I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
<s> When'd you do it?
<s> I wonder if that was the same copter.
<s> Yeah, it still runs.
<s> What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
<s> He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
<s> I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
<s> I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
<s> He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
<s> Well, he's killing now.
<s> Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
<s> You'll get blown outta here some day.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> What, sir?
<s> I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
<s> Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
<s> No. Walked.
<s> Who knows.
<s> I met him.
<s> Music?
<s> I'm Kurtz.
<s> You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
<s> No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
<s> Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
<s> No -- leave it --
<s> Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
<s> And shut up.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> Yes.
<s> No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
<s> You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
<s> 23   CONTINUED:  
<s> Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
<s> I'll get you there all right.
<s> How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
<s> Keep back.
<s> I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
<s> Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
<s> -- Corbett's a killer.
<s> Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
<s> Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
<s> You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
<s> It's exactly what you meant.
<s> Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
<s> Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
<s> I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
<s> I'm here to do my job.
<s> If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
<s> I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
<s> Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
<s> -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
<s> Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
<s> Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
<s> Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
<s> Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
<s> It's a long shot.
<s> Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
<s> Musta never got a chance to -more-
<s> They'll have to come right past us.
<s> No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
<s> Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
<s> No.
<s> No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
<s> His home number.
<s> Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
<s> Okay.
<s> Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
<s> Note. Put it in the note.
<s> I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
<s> Whether crabs are in season there now...
<s> Nonsense!
<s> No.
<s> Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
<s> Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
<s> Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
<s> Never.
<s> Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
<s> Were you asleep?
<s> Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
<s> Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
<s> I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
<s> I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
<s> I'm sorry... are you okay?
<s> Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
<s> It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
<s> Okay by me.
<s> "What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
<s> No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
<s> Well, I can't reach them.
<s> 'Love was... '
<s> Okay, then.
<s> I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
<s> Oh, my gosh.
<s> Got any easier questions?
<s> I'm going back with you.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
<s> I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
<s> What?  You think I'm running you up?
<s> How long have you been freelance?
<s> I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
<s> Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
<s> Sure.
<s> A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
<s> I know.  It was a joke.
<s> He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> What?  How did you know I had a cat?
<s> Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
<s> Ten million --
<s> Until a minute ago.
<s> Because he is trying to retire me.
<s> The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
<s> We don't have a choice.
<s> We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
<s> You were like a boy genius?
<s> Ahhhh...
<s> Why not?
<s> They tried to kill you?
<s> Because I want to know.
<s> After that?
<s> Does that mean it didn't bother you?
<s> Where is it?
<s> You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
<s> Check.
<s> Okay.  Then what?
<s> What?  What if he brings it with him?
<s> No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
<s> I didn't notice them.
<s> Are you attracted to me?
<s> Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
<s> She was taken.
<s> Okay.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.  Please come in.
<s> I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
<s> Honesty.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
<s> No.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
<s> No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
<s> These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
<s> We could make a run for it?
<s> Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
<s> That makes you an expert I guess.
<s> Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
<s> Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
<s> I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
<s> Tough break.
<s> Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
<s> Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
<s> I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
<s> Is it gone four-thirty?
<s> No, for the Asylum.
<s> Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
<s> Both, see you later.
<s> I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
<s> I could try and get a Western lawyer.
<s> Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
<s> Here!
<s> So am I.
<s> I'll take a rain-check for now.
<s> Yeah, maybe.
<s> What?
<s> No way Doug, I can't.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
<s> Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
<s> So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
<s> Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
<s> Ah, so what?
<s> A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
<s> No, it should be over soon.
<s> I had it coming from someone.
<s> Uh-huh!
<s> Cool!
<s> I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
<s> A drill, what are you up to?
<s> Just yesterday.
<s> Why?
<s> You bastard!
<s> This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
<s> That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
<s> Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
<s> Kelly wouldn't do that.
<s> No. I won't be long.
<s> He wants to talk to you.
<s> It was.
<s> -- This play means a lot to me.
<s> -- Your act only works with an audience.
<s> Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
<s> So you agree you need help?
<s> Go for it.
<s> Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
<s> And you have to meet my father.
<s> He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
<s> Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
<s> The dirty snowball at its core.
<s> My relationship with God is my own.
<s> Interpreted by another guy like my father.
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> Thank you. So were you.
<s> Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<s> I heard what you did. Thank you.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Loved?
<s> I don't care.
<s> I'm not applying to college.
<s> All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
<s> I was going to fake it.
<s> Because you have hope that you'll get better?
<s> It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
<s> He wants help with his lines --
<s> I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
<s> Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
<s> Up to?
<s> Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
<s> Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
<s> Your parents are divorced?
<s> I'm not tired.
<s> I'm no dummy.
<s> Where did you get -- ?
<s> You came here to give me my report card?
<s> What do you want, Biff?
<s> I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
<s> Uh, thanks...
<s> Poly-what?
<s> Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
<s> Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
<s> No!
<s> What drill?
<s> Good.
<s> Not now....
<s> Bic... It's a Bic pen.
<s> Not a holocaust --
<s> You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
<s> What's this all about?
<s> Pro! Release the rope!
<s> AM or PM?
<s> ...To be traveled through
<s> The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
<s> Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
<s> Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
<s> Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
<s> We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
<s> According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
<s> Sure,.
<s> Dick? Dick who?
<s> Hi, Marty!
<s> What did you do to yours?
<s> Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
<s> She plays the clarinet, too.
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay.
<s> I used to throw trash for the City.
<s> Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
<s> I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Just don't... I've got a headache.
<s> Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But it would hurt.
<s> They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
<s> I'm fine. Kind of tired.
<s> He was nervous.
<s> I don't blame him.
<s> Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
<s> Yes?
<s> Just thinking.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
<s> Beats me.
<s> New Jersey?
<s> They're stealing my chopper!
<s> Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
<s> Have you warned Professor Hikita?
<s> And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
<s> Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
<s> Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
<s> I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
<s> Where's the professor?
<s> New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
<s> To get my guns.
<s> Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
<s> Everybody okay up here?
<s> What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
<s> I wish he was.  He's real enough.
<s> A what?
<s> No, sir.  I think the flint...
<s> Why me?
<s> Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
<s> Why me?
<s> Asshole probably got lost.
<s> Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
<s> Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
<s> That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
<s> What?! He's a son of a bitch!
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
<s> I want to know!
<s> Hah!
<s> I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
<s> Stop it, Bill!
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> I...
<s> W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
<s> All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
<s> I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
<s> We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
<s> What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
<s> Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
<s> But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
<s> Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
<s> No, what did it say?
<s> Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
<s> Hell, I could tell you some stories
<s> And I could tell you some stories 
<s> Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
<s> No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
<s> Nope.
<s> Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor  though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
<s> Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
<s> Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
<s> You gotta believe me 
<s> Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
<s> Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now don't argue with me.
<s> Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
<s> I'm at the Earle.
<s> Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
<s> Nine days  Tuesday 
<s> Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
<s> Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
<s> Ya see how he's not writing it down?
<s> Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
<s> You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
<s> Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
<s> It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
<s> Sometimes I really hate you.
<s> I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
<s> Tell me about Catherine.
<s> What did she tell me, Beth?
<s> I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
<s> She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
<s> I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
<s> What?
<s> No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
<s> I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
<s> No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
<s> You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
<s> Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
<s> Didn't you study it in school?
<s> Please.
<s> Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
<s> What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
<s> Fine.  How's your back?
<s> I know.
<s> When?
<s> Why?
<s> What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
<s> Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
<s> Come over here and tell me no.
<s> It won't sell.
<s> We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
<s> I hope I helped you out.
<s> What is it you got between you?
<s> I went over last night, too.
<s> You don't like punk rockers?
<s> I feel fine!
<s> Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
<s> Catherine told me what was in it.
<s> She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
<s> Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
<s> She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
<s> Can you check again?
<s> No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
<s> The whole thing  painting.
<s> I think it's in New Jersey.
<s> Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
<s> My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
<s> We can do better. It needed more white.
<s> No.
<s> Not black.
<s> Chateau Latour '64, please.
<s> The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
<s> 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
<s> Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
<s> A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
<s> C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
<s> Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
<s> You mean babies with you?
<s> He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
<s> Sure. I'd be glad to.
<s> They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
<s> You like your dad's paintings?
<s> Have a Mac.
<s> Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
<s> No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
<s> Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
<s> I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
<s> Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
<s> Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
<s> No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
<s> Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
<s> I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
<s> "We"?  You and...
<s> If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
<s> Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
<s> But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
<s> Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
<s> Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
<s> You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
<s> Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
<s> Oswald:  We need one more thing.
<s> Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
<s> Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
<s> I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
<s> In spirit only, I'm afraid.
<s> Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
<s> Yes?
<s> Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
<s> Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
<s> I recognized the accent.
<s> Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
<s> Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.
<s> Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
<s> I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
<s> Me too.  Great stems, though.
<s> Just the beast.
<s> Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
<s> I see you knew him.
<s> I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
<s> Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
<s> Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
<s> Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
<s> I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
<s> You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
<s> Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
<s> I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
<s> Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
<s> Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
<s> As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
<s> At you?  Polly want a kiss?
<s> You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
<s> Our work?
<s> Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
<s> I wonder if she'd go out with me.
<s> I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
<s> He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
<s> The _Rolls_?
<s> Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
<s> Enigma.
<s> How ya doin', Al?
<s> Big house. How many rooms?
<s> I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
<s> Try a fireman. Less to take off.
<s> Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
<s> Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
<s> Just ones this beautiful.
<s> On occasion. Usually at night.
<s> Would you? I'm not so sure.
<s> Well, I met someone...
<s> What?
<s> I'm not-
<s> How could I forget?
<s> Paranoid? The psychotic?
<s> ...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
<s> Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
<s> Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
<s> About what?
<s> You sunk my battleship.
<s> Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
<s> ... A hundred and eight?
<s> Well -- I think you might consider
<s> I loathe bats.
<s> That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
<s> You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
<s> Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
<s> Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
<s> Finding out where she is.
<s> WHAT?
<s> Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
<s> Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
<s> Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
<s> Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
<s> ... Behind the makeup?
<s> Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
<s> Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
<s> What were you thinking?
<s> Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
<s> Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
<s> Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
<s> I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
<s> 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
<s> Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
<s> Ahm.....
<s> But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
<s> Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
<s> Great news.
<s> Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
<s> Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
<s> I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
<s> Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
<s> Certainly is.
<s> Sean Connery.
<s> Great, good.
<s> Okay.....
<s> I am sorry you feel that way.
<s> Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
<s> Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
<s> Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
<s> Uh... Uh...
<s> Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
<s> C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
<s> Dill-wad...
<s> That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
<s> Just make sure it looks like an accident...
<s> Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
<s> This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
<s> Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
<s> Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
<s> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
<s> Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
<s> Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
<s> This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
<s> I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
<s> No, I'm not putting up with this.
<s> We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
<s> Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
<s> It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
<s> This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
<s> I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
<s> Who did the sushi?
<s> Just a hunch.
<s> 3:30 I guess.
<s> All right.
<s> D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
<s> Now, let's get rolling!
<s> We tried.
<s> Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
<s> Yes.
<s> Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
<s> Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
<s> That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
<s> Are you a spirit too?
<s> Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
<s> I... I don't know what your name is.
<s> It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
<s> It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
<s> How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
<s> You've got to help them.
<s> He's a cloven-hooved beast!
<s> At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
<s> What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
<s> Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
<s> Why not?
<s> Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
<s> Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
<s> Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
<s> I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
<s> Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
<s> This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
<s> Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
<s> Attic space.
<s> Look at the tiny figures.
<s> That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
<s> There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
<s> Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
<s> Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
<s> That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
<s> Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
<s> ... But he's...?
<s> Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. I'm a gardener.
<s> No. It won't do that.
<s> Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
<s> I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
<s> Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> How is Ben feeling?
<s> Good night, Eve.
<s> Hello, Sid.
<s> The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
<s> I don't want Robert.
<s> I agree.
<s> Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
<s> Yes. I like that name very much.
<s> I see. I would like to work in your garden.
<s> Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
<s> But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
<s> No, Ben.
<s> Yes. I would like to do that.
<s> Yes. I like to watch very much.
<s> Hello, Ronald.
<s> Yes, I would like to see Ben.
<s> I never needed money.
<s> No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
<s> It's very sore.
<s> I'm going to work in the garden.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. I was there with Ben.
<s> Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
<s> I was given meals, and a home...
<s> Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
<s> No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
<s> ... Hello.
<s> I said - try again.
<s> Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
<s> ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
<s> Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
<s> Look, Johanna...
<s> No problem, Chief.
<s> We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
<s> That could be possible...
<s> Thank you, Colonel.
<s> Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
<s> It's that serious, huh?
<s> Mr. Gardiner...
<s> This is my fiancee Maxine.
<s> Malkovich!
<s> Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
<s> May 11th.
<s> I... puppeteer.
<s> Hmmm.
<s> She's very beautiful.
<s> What?
<s> I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
<s> Don't crowd me, Craig.
<s> Me and John.
<s> Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
<s> Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
<s> And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
<s> This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
<s> Schwartz.
<s> Forget it.
<s> Yes?
<s> I am a trained performer.
<s> Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
<s> You're insane.
<s> How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
<s> You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
<s> No, really.
<s> Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
<s> I'm right?
<s> You're a fag or a liar.
<s> It better be.
<s> Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
<s> You're evil, Maxine.
<s> Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
<s> How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
<s> I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
<s> Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
<s> A scary dream?
<s> I like that.
<s> Says who?
<s> That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
<s> Yes, Hi.
<s> I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
<s> Did you see the reviews?
<s> Great then.
<s> No.
<s> Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
<s> Oh, Lotte...
<s> I can explain about the portal, darling.
<s> You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
<s> Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
<s> I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
<s> If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
<s> Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
<s> What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
<s> Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
<s> YOUR FACE IS MINE.
<s> Don't pay to complain.
<s> Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
<s> Extra?
<s> Mama?
<s> Oh I been out.
<s> That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
<s> Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
<s> He ask, I give him anything.
<s> Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
<s> What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
<s> Never found out.
<s> Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
<s> She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
<s> Yeah. Look bad?
<s> Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
<s> What do you think?
<s> You're not dealing with morons here.
<s> Huh.
<s> Oh, nothin', you know.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
<s> Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
<s> She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
<s> Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
<s> I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.
<s> I'm shomer shabbas.
<s> Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
<s> Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Nancy's pretty good.
<s> And what do you do, sir?
<s> Far from it.
<s> I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
<s> --your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
<s> Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
<s> Now I got--
<s> I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
<s> Is he pretending to be the abductor?
<s> Do you still have that doctor's number?
<s> It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
<s> Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
<s> Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
<s> There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
<s> This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
<s> Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
<s> Walter, he peed on my rug--
<s> You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
<s> Hey Walter--
<s> It's your roll--
<s> Easy, Dude.
<s> That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
<s> Whose toe was it, Walter?
<s> --We're sympathizing here, Dude--
<s> Is the car out front yours?
<s> And the fucking money!
<s> What's your point, Dude?
<s> What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
<s> Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
<s> Come on, Walter!.
<s> The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
<s> No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
<s> Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
<s> Well. . . yeah.
<s> I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
<s> I said out.  Now.
<s> Am I wrong!?
<s> Impressive.
<s> We'll take 'em in the morning.
<s> The House of Pain.
<s> We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
<s> Minutes.
<s> If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
<s> Fry 'em.
<s> For what?
<s> Why?
<s> You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
<s> So?
<s> For what?
<s> You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
<s> Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
<s> Two so far.
<s> No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
<s> Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
<s> Are we bringing home strays now?
<s> Just do it, old man.
<s> I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
<s> You're joking --
<s> Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
<s> He didn't. Get over it.
<s> Look closer.
<s> You get used to the darkness.
<s> Some. It's been slow --
<s> I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
<s> I've been better --
<s> You're a week early.
<s> You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
<s> The other elders will never let you get away with this!
<s> I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
<s> Sometimes. Where are we going?
<s> Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
<s> No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
<s> The Witch's voice.
<s> No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
<s> Oh, sorry, right.
<s> I haven't killed any--
<s> Domini. Domini Von Teer.
<s> Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
<s> You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
<s> You feel no need to get married or anything.
<s> Sleep.
<s> Why?
<s> <u>Before</u> 5:00--
<s> I want amphetamines.
<s> --hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
<s> Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
<s> Well, please keep me fucking informed!
<s> --there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
<s> Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
<s> It's not about witches, goddamnit!
<s> Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
<s> Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
<s> What're you doing with all this shit?
<s> My room, asleep, last I checked.
<s> --I saw what I saw.
<s> --hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
<s> --a Wiccan--
<s> <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
<s> No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<s> --I dunno, I just woke up--
<s> I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
<s> Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
<s> What're you nuts--
<s> One of the printers.
<s> --and we brought it back with us!
<s> Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
<s> There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
<s> He'll never know.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> That's why she kills children.
<s> Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Shoot.
<s> I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
<s> Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
<s> His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
<s> It won't?
<s> Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
<s> Your husband.
<s> You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
<s> I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
<s> Abby--
<s> Yeah.
<s> Marty.
<s> I think someone's watching.
<s> You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
<s> What?
<s> Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
<s> Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
<s> No. It just made them feel better.
<s> It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
<s> I didn't say that.  Well?
<s> I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
<s> What.
<s> No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
<s> I've seen a few.
<s> Okay honey.
<s> Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
<s> Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
<s> Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
<s> EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
<s> Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you know?
<s> Don't say that.
<s> . same here.
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
<s> Frank would open you.
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> No.  Hi baby.
<s> Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
<s> He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
<s> Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
<s> Go where?
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
<s> Maybe so.
<s> Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
<s> Where are they?
<s> Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
<s> Alright. Good luck, yourself.
<s> I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
<s> Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
<s> Go ahead!
<s> Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
<s> Um-hmm.
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> You'll see for yourself.
<s> I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
<s> Yeah, I don't feel so well.
<s> Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> We want some grass.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Nothing.  Just a little project.
<s> Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
<s> I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
<s> Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
<s> Now do you see what I am saying?
<s> We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
<s> Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
<s> Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
<s> I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
<s> I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
<s> Just a friend.
<s> We're half a million off.
<s> I love you too, man.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
<s> Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> Tough spot.
<s> Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
<s> I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
<s> That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
<s> He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
<s> Figured what out?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
<s> Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
<s> How are you doing?
<s> Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
<s> You swear?
<s> It's alright, Dad.
<s> We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
<s> Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
<s> Who speaks Spanish?
<s> Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
<s> Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
<s> Dien Bien Phu?
<s> Sail.
<s> Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
<s> Sure. By shooting at me.
<s> Then don't complain.
<s> No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
<s> Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
<s> She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
<s> Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
<s> You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
<s> You got something on the coke?
<s> She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
<s> You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
<s> That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
<s> The official cause?
<s> I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
<s> You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
<s> Sit down, Frank.
<s> Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
<s> Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
<s> Aren't they all?
<s> I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
<s> Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
<s> The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
<s> You get his statement?
<s> I had some papers to pick up.
<s> Six years.
<s> Yes.
<s> Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
<s> We were lovers.
<s> It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
<s> I had a bad heart.
<s> She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
<s> I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
<s> Who was your primary beneficiary?
<s> No.  No, I don't.
<s> One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
<s> Then -- those are not your own words?
<s> While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
<s> What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
<s> He video taped you.
<s> You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
<s> It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
<s> You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
<s> Yes.
<s> She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
<s> A.M -- or P.M.?
<s> Yes.
<s> There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
<s> I know.
<s> It's not my taste.
<s> I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
<s> I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
<s> It won't be that hard.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
<s> It's only the beginning.
<s> I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
<s> What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
<s> You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
<s> Shoot him.
<s> We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
<s> The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
<s> That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
<s> Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
<s> I'm always open to learning new things.
<s> Where have you been?
<s> Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
<s> It was a place to start.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
<s> It didn't get there from me.
<s> We were here two Christmases ago.
<s> I said NO!
<s> Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
<s> Aw, Betty.
<s> Michael.
<s> That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
<s> '82.
<s> Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
<s> You mean -- she didn't like sex?
<s> Was this during Betty?
<s> Did we want to?
<s> You're right -- that is sick.
<s> No, what?
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> I'll get right on it.
<s> You want me to call the doctor?
<s> No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's it.
<s> Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
<s> I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
<s> Oh. How old?
<s> But I... We don't even know each other.
<s> It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
<s> We got engaged.
<s> Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
<s> I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
<s> No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
<s> Yes.
<s> I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
<s> I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
<s> No. I was just... No.
<s> No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
<s> I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
<s> I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
<s> It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
<s> Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
<s> You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
<s> No.
<s> Well, what is this?
<s> No one's asking you to!
<s> The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
<s> Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
<s> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
<s> Later. Go back to sleep.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> What's her name?
<s> Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
<s> Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
<s> That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
<s> Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
<s> Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
<s> Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
<s> I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
<s> Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
<s> Hush, baby.
<s> I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
<s> I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
<s> Then fuck it!!!
<s> I have to finish this for class.
<s> You mean as opposed to your life?
<s> You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
<s> Who?
<s> Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
<s> I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
<s> Or you didn't know what to do with it.
<s> Now you.
<s> It was just like in my head.
<s> Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
<s> Potential toxic dump site.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Should I?
<s> Save him?  What are you talking about?
<s> We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
<s> All right!  Where's the key?
<s> That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
<s> What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
<s> It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
<s> Why?
<s> I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
<s> Caesar ...
<s> Caesar, what are you going to do?
<s> Not until he has the money!
<s> You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
<s> Good boy.
<s> Sure, Gino, sure.
<s> It's all right, sir.
<s> No.  Rajeev's in India.
<s> I should be going.
<s> My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
<s> Why?
<s> Hey, Mickey.
<s> Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
<s> Yeah, that's it.
<s> Where in the hell is he?
<s> Leave your phone on the hook.
<s> This is the police, ma'am.
<s> All right.
<s> ...  thank you.
<s> Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
<s> Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
<s> Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
<s> Basically.
<s> Almost five years.
<s> I guess I wanted to.
<s> Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
<s> I suppose he just wants to watch.
<s> He was in love with you, right?
<s> Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
<s> How much money?
<s> He hung it up.
<s> Yeah.
<s> If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
<s> I'm still here.
<s> You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
<s> Don't be sorry.  Help me.
<s> I'm here, aren't I?
<s> No.
<s> Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
<s> ...it's a problem...
<s> What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, Jesus... 
<s> Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
<s> I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
<s> Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
<s> I guess.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> You're wrong.  I didn't know.
<s> It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

<s> So get the hell out of here.
<s> -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
<s> -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
<s> -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!

<s> -- we're evacuating the building --
<s> Where am I?
<s> How did I get here?
<s> I fixed it myself.
<s> Got there!
<s> ... ere please.
<s> ... new washer.
<s> Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
<s> Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
<s> Really? - God, how time flies!
<s> Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
<s> Ah ...
<s> Am I?
<s> Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
<s> Do you know what you're doing.
<s> Jack ...
<s> Ah.
<s> It's you ... it's you ...
<s> Who are you?
<s> No.
<s> Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
<s> Well, all wars do -
<s> What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
<s> Are you still following me?
<s> Leave me alone!
<s> You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
<s> No you're not!
<s> It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
<s> I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
<s> I delivered it.
<s> I did it for you.
<s> Sam Lowry.
<s> This is your dream girl, is it?
<s> You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
<s> What is it?
<s> Actually, I've decided ...
<s> Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
<s> Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
<s> No, sir.
<s> No need, sir
<s> We'll be back.
<s> Who fixed your ducts?
<s> Thermostat's gone. And then some.
<s> The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
<s> I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
<s> I don't think a week's gonna do it.
<s> I should be going. I just quit.
<s> Just take it easy.
<s> You're going to live.
<s> I was tired. I needed a coffee.
<s> Ten-four, hon.
<s> Oh man, Bucky.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
<s> How is she?
<s> You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
<s> Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
<s> Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
<s> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
<s> I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
<s> Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
<s> Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
<s> It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
<s> The ghosts--
<s> Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
<s> It's coming.
<s> No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
<s> Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
<s> I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
<s> I never felt better in my life.
<s> What?
<s> Relax, will you.
<s> Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
<s> You write this?
<s> You've made my dreams silly.
<s> And the rule was...
<s> Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
<s> Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
<s> I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
<s> I don't like the word gay.
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> Did you shoot their boots?
<s> Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
<s> Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
<s> Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
<s> Okay, great -- good luck.
<s> Define your terms.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah -- being a basket case.
<s> Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
<s> Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
<s> I understand.  I'll go with you.
<s> So I quit.
<s> Move away from me.
<s> Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes?
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
<s> It's started.
<s> Right there, Bobbie.
<s> My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
<s> No.  Really...don't worry about it.
<s> Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
<s> Oh.
<s> They fired me.
<s> No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
<s> Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
<s> Would it help if I got you a tutor?
<s> Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
<s> You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
<s> I trust you.
<s> Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
<s> So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
<s> I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
<s> Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
<s> Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
<s> What?
<s> Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
<s> Why, you need me for the story?
<s> It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
<s> Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
<s> He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
<s> Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
<s> Right back to you.
<s> I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Not anymore!
<s> I didn't finish talking to you!
<s> You're breaking my concentration!
<s> Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
<s> Better!
<s> Walter!  Jeez!
<s> Every word...
<s> Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
<s> You think I'm creative?
<s> I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
<s> No! I want to talk about it now!
<s> What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> What is it, your laundry?
<s> Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
<s> Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
<s> What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
<s> You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
<s> Can't you see I'm busy here?
<s> C-connection?
<s> Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
<s> Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
<s> I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
<s> What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
<s> What's the matter with you!
<s> Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
<s> I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
<s> Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
<s> Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
<s> Bummer metaphor.
<s> Let me in.
<s> You look like shit, Benny.
<s> You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
<s> Nothing.  It was just a dream.
<s> Hi.
<s> So I noticed.
<s> I'm out of here.  Jenny.
<s> Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
<s> I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
<s> I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
<s> Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
<s> You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
<s> ) What do you think?
<s> Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
<s> Yeah, whoops I came.
<s> You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
<s> In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
<s> Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
<s> Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
<s> What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
<s> There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
<s> It isn't important.
<s> I was just scared is all.
<s> How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
<s> I guess.
<s> Nicole...
<s> Hi.
<s> What's happening?  What do you want?
<s> She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
<s> Hi, Grueller.
<s> Well, I hope so.
<s> Throw it out.
<s> You want some punch?
<s> Nice much.
<s> Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
<s> Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
<s> Run.
<s> Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
<s> Switch nostrils?
<s> Nuke?!
<s> Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
<s> I know what it is.
<s> He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
<s> You don't have to...
<s> We all deserve to wear white.
<s> Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
<s> Yep.
<s> When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
<s> Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
<s> You okay?
<s> Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
<s> She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
<s> You need a nickname.
<s> Which one of us?
<s> The socks?  It's cold in here.
<s> Never heard of 'em.
<s> Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
<s> It was a cocksucking call!
<s> I thought I was--
<s> Gimme that.
<s> A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
<s> Naw...
<s> It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
<s> Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
<s> Yep.  So how's Annie?
<s> Then go.
<s> C ' mon!
<s> Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
<s> Yeah, thanks for everything.
<s> You too...Meat.
<s> Pussy.
<s> We'll pray anyway.
<s> C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
<s> We're eight and sixteen.
<s> Looking for Crash Davis.
<s> They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
<s> What?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Good to see ya.  William would you...
<s> Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
<s> Was I at that dinner?
<s> Excuse me.
<s> ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
<s> Yeah, yeah. I know that.
<s> You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
<s> Eight.
<s> Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
<s> Somethin', huh?
<s> Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
<s> And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
<s> It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -
<s> Four aces, Doc.
<s> No.
<s> What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
<s> What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
<s> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
<s> I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
<s> You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
<s> Hey, she came to talk...
<s> It's none of my business?
<s> A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
<s> What people?
<s> Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
<s> Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
<s> She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
<s> How do you do?
<s> No, that's quite all right.
<s> Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
<s> I'll come by.
<s> ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
<s> ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
<s> We can't get rid of him?
<s> Certainly.  Senator.
<s> L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
<s> I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
<s> Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
<s> The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
<s> But as much as they loved her...
<s> Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
<s> Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
<s> I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't need one.
<s> That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
<s> Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
<s> I gotta tell ya...
<s> He wanted a watch, too.
<s> Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
<s> You're not takin' Amy.
<s> I threw it away.
<s> Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
<s> I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
<s> Listen to me.
<s> You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
<s> I'm not -
<s> But it was just mine.
<s> Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
<s> We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
<s> What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
<s> I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
<s> You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
<s> Can you do it with your left hand?
<s> What?
<s> Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
<s> Hi. Good.
<s> I can't.
<s> You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
<s> If we let her get a few of her things we'll be out of your hair.
<s> I did - I didn't -
<s> Oh.
<s> How are you?
<s> Yeah, I heard, yeah.
<s> Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
<s> All right.
<s> No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
<s> I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> You did. You're right.
<s> I did what you told me to.
<s> I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
<s> Thank you. Very nice.
<s> Get lost?
<s> No, Lester.
<s> Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
<s> Promise?
<s> You do?
<s> Okay, then.
<s> Here.
<s> Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
<s> All right.
<s> You know why, right?
<s> I took care of everybody.
<s> ...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
<s> Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
<s> So are we.
<s> Go fuck yourself.
<s> Yeah, what'd you tell him?
<s> You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
<s> Yeah, what's to stop him?
<s> I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
<s> Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
<s> Fuck you, you motherfuck!
<s> Fuck you!
<s> Ch-Charlie M!
<s> Hey.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
<s> All right, all right. But I - I -
<s> You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
<s> Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
<s> This looks promising...
<s> Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
<s> Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
<s> I wonder..
<s> Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
<s> Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
<s> I'm sure.
<s> She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
<s> Winning.
<s> What about "climbing in?"
<s> Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
<s> Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
<s> Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
<s> I know.
<s> It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
<s> What's the name of your child's best friend?
<s> Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
<s> I actually got some memory back last night.
<s> What did--?
<s> What?
<s> You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
<s> I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
<s> Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
<s> It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
<s> Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
<s> I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
<s> You going to talk all day?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't see anybody in there but you.
<s> Do I hear a woman's voice?
<s> You could've made me lose my call.
<s> I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
<s> You could've killed us.
<s> Why would I do that?
<s> Or relieve me of it later.
<s> Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> I was worried about you.  Both of you.
<s> I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
<s> I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
<s> My name is --
<s> I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
<s> Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
<s> What about the others?
<s> I'm about ten blocks from the school.
<s> I can hear you again, clearly.
<s> It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
<s> Don't say that.
<s> No.
<s> Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
<s> Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
<s> Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
<s> Lucky for them they didn't.
<s> That's coming off.  How about the girl?
<s> You're going to let them get away with this?
<s> They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
<s> I thought it was inspired.
<s> Why pick me to be your "mark?"
<s> He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
<s> He seems to be headed for Topanga.
<s> The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
<s> Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
<s> You wouldn't --
<s> Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
<s> I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
<s> Why are we stopping?
<s> Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
<s> You won't live to see it.
<s> Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Didn't we play this scene before?
<s> Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
<s> You'll see her.
<s> You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
<s> Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
<s> You'll still have the girl and the husband.
<s> Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
<s> You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> And if you ditch us we get zilch.
<s> And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
<s> I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
<s> Five minutes.
<s> Them.  They won't be expecting us.
<s> There's no lady here.
<s> Undercover.
<s> Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
<s> Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Nice.
<s> An excellent quality.
<s> Cunt.
<s> Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
<s> What's it to you?
<s> He wants me to perform for him.
<s> God no. I'm a hairdresser.
<s> You can't leave me then, can you?
<s> Where?
<s> They're jealous.
<s> How special?
<s> Whiskey.
<s> How different?
<s> Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
<s> Depends what it is.
<s> Where?
<s> Never said a truer word.
<s> Do you care, Jimmy?
<s> Sorry.
<s> You can always pretend.
<s> Are you pretending yet?
<s> I miss you, Jimmy.
<s> Delirious.
<s> Kind of.
<s> Why shouldn't I be jealous?
<s> More than that.
<s> A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
<s> I promise.
<s> No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
<s> Sorry. What you doing?
<s> You knew my Jody?
<s> I like you, DIl
<s> Love you, Dil.
<s> Anything.
<s> I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
<s> Please, Dil --
<s> As the man said, it's in my nature.
<s> He's all right.
<s> Leave me alone, Jude.
<s> Suits you.
<s> Och, you do, Fergie.
<s> And what happens then?
<s> Do you want a cup of tea?
<s> It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
<s> Who'd you think it was?
<s> Definitely unusual.
<s> Am I?
<s> Not in your nature.
<s> I'm talking about your people, not you.
<s> I didn't even fancy her.
<s> What?
<s> She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
<s> Best game in the world.
<s> Don't be so sure.
<s> Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
<s> I've often wondered how you do it.
<s> Want you to do something, Fergus.
<s> Stop it --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Me? No, I'm not good for much...
<s> Why?
<s> Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
<s> You won't run.
<s> Adam --
<s> There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
<s> It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
<s> Look.
<s> No!
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
<s> Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
<s> But --
<s> Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
<s> Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
<s> Were you followed?
<s> Describe him.
<s> I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
<s> Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
<s> Me? Why me?
<s> Agents.
<s> The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
<s> Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
<s> Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
<s> Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
<s> The last one, please.
<s> Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
<s> The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
<s> It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
<s> Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
<s> Which one are you?
<s> Oh. 
<s> I'm scared.
<s> No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
<s> What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
<s> I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
<s> Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
<s> Fiction or non-fiction?
<s> Go on.
<s> I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
<s> The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> Swiss.
<s> A letter? May I see it?
<s> It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
<s> I know. I would bury it in the garden.
<s> Up there! I would put it up there!
<s> I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
<s> Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
<s> Now you're angry.
<s> Charles is.
<s> Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
<s> He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
<s> That's what I'm not supposed to say.
<s> Where?
<s> What?
<s> Be careful, Peter.
<s> A quarter of a million dollars.
<s> He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
<s> But what?
<s> Because I don't love him.
<s> Didn't Charles have any friends?
<s> Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
<s> We want that money -- now!
<s> WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
<s> Not my imports.
<s> I just wanted to check that you were okay?
<s> Calm down Brent.
<s> Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
<s> I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
<s> No I wasn't.
<s> There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
<s> She works at a church?
<s> Yeah. You should check downstairs.
<s> People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
<s> Who's?
<s> No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
<s> You know about that too?
<s> Of course I'm scared.
<s> You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
<s> Does she fuck?
<s> I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
<s> The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
<s> What party?
<s> Stag?
<s> Sharon's far from a slut.
<s> Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
<s> Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
<s> I love you.
<s> You can ask me anything.
<s> No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
<s> The men. Do any of them still live around here?
<s> I'm worried about someone.
<s> Hi Sandy.

<s> Would you hurry up, please?
<s> Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
<s> I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
<s> I did not steal this truck!
<s> ...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
<s> Okay.
<s>   Oh, we're screwed, Night...
<s> I don't think we have much of a choice...

<s> I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
<s> No!
<s> I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
<s> Grateful?
<s> Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
<s> Pleasant surprise.
<s> Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

<s> If that's what it says.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Do you know him?
<s> Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
<s> Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
<s> She's fine.
<s> That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
<s> I have no idea. How much do you want?
<s> You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
<s> Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
<s> No thanks.
<s> Where's that?
<s> I said okay, Jake.
<s> The apple core club.
<s> You're welcome to try. There he is.
<s> You mean that's what you're going to call it.
<s> Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
<s> Shut up.  Go on.
<s> Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
<s> Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
<s> What are you having?
<s> You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
<s> I have?
<s> I was grateful.
<s> She's cheating on him.
<s> Where you were when your husband died.
<s> You were seeing someone, too.
<s> Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
<s> What dam?
<s> Is that unusual?
<s> They can't be.
<s> That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
<s> You bastard.
<s> The police?
<s> Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
<s> Aren't you coming back with me?
<s> No...
<s> She's my sister and my daughter!
<s> I have to go home and get my things.
<s> But, Mr. Gittes.
<s> What'd you expect? That's his job.
<s> A Miss Sessions calling.
<s> Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
<s> Perhaps if we could meet your father.
<s> I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
<s> I'm sorry, I --
<s> I never was.
<s> Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
<s> Yes...
<s> When it comes? What'd you tell him?
<s> ...Yes of course.
<s> He was expecting you?
<s> Yes. Yes, they were partners.
<s> Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.

<s> I'm working for his daughter.
<s> You don't say?
<s> Fifty lire... 
<s> Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
<s> But don't you like anything about what you do? 
<s> Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
<s> Too bad!
<s> For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
<s> What you say is wonderful! But sad...
<s> I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
<s> Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
<s> Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
<s> We'll talk about that later.
<s> For what?
<s> Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
<s> One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
<s> Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
<s> He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
<s> What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
<s> No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
<s> Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
<s> Thais.
<s> Ready for dinner, Brad?
<s> I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
<s> Yes -
<s> Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
<s> Yes.
<s> 
<s> September the ninth?
<s> I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
<s> Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
<s> There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
<s> Of course.
<s> I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
<s> I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
<s> Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
<s> You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
<s> You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
<s> I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
<s> Susan, I really think -
<s> Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
<s> Can't say, sir.
<s> It's been a tough day.
<s> It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
<s> How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
<s> Charlie -
<s> It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
<s> Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
<s> Look out that window.
<s> I've got to think of Emily -
<s> I'll get you some coffee.
<s> That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
<s> She was going to leave you anyway -
<s> Why is she leaving me?
<s> Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
<s> Yes.
<s> This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
<s> There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
<s> We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
<s> Rosebud?
<s> Am I sure about what?
<s> It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
<s> You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
<s> Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
<s> You two better quit it.
<s> Just now.
<s> Very dramatic, I thought.
<s> Thanks for the vote of confidence.
<s> But you were.
<s> Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
<s> Jesus, you're caustic.
<s> Sang.
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
<s> I left like an hour ago.
<s> It wasn't me.
<s> I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
<s> I'll assess all I want!
<s> Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
<s> I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
<s> What's your point?
<s> Peptic ulcer.
<s> Oooh! Navy Seals!
<s> I thought Redding had like three balls!
<s> Why are the shutters closed?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Blasphemy.
<s> Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
<s> The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
<s> Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
<s> And you figured it out?
<s> Can we talk about this later?
<s> How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
<s> I don't back down.
<s> You know what pisses me off the most?
<s> Can we not talk about this?
<s> I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
<s> Bible truth.
<s> I swear.
<s> Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
<s> My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
<s> Balls resting on his lips.
<s> I never tried it.
<s> I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
<s> You want to rent a movie.
<s> Not yet. 
<s> And this is what you rented?
<s> Living proof.
<s> I don't; you did.
<s> I'm happy.
<s> I'm not. She just left.
<s> Watch the store while I go home and change.
<s> In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
<s> I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
<s> Could be.
<s> I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
<s> Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
<s> Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
<s> Helluva day.
<s> Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
<s> THE GLADES MOTEL?
<s> How much can you bench?
<s> See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Done poisoning the youth for the day?
<s> I don't know. I wasn't watching.
<s> Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
<s> Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
<s> No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
<s> I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.
<s> It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
<s> How many what?
<s> Twelve.
<s> You're a pig.
<s> I'm not the pig you are.
<s> Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
<s> ...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
<s> ...it isn't there. Yes.
<s> And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
<s> I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
<s> I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
<s> According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.

<s> She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
<s> I hope it feels good.
<s> I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
<s> Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
<s> That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
<s> C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
<s> I admit, I can be bought.
<s> Bags?
<s> Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
<s> Hey, fuck you.
<s> Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
<s> I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
<s> There wasn't time for anything else.
<s> Not on that leg.
<s> Okay--I don't know about this.
<s> I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
<s> Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
<s> Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
<s> On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
<s> From one professional to another, of course.
<s> He doesn't want my help.
<s> I only came back for you.
<s> What are you doing here!?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> You know me, I'm a night person.
<s> Sure, just give it back when you're done.
<s> If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
<s> Next time, date only basketball players.
<s> Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
<s> That's exactly what I want you to do.
<s> Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
<s> Right, all the bullets we can eat.
<s> I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
<s> Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
<s> Half a day.
<s> Then it's a deal.
<s> On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
<s> Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
<s> Good morning, Walt.
<s> The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
<s> Of course. Food alright?
<s> Phoned some friends, sir?
<s> Help me, sir?
<s> Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
<s> Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
<s> Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
<s> New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
<s> Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
<s> No, sir, I feel really great.
<s> Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
<s> Well - I'm back.
<s> Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
<s> ... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Crabs?
<s> Lice?
<s> Through there for a bath.
<s> You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
<s> I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
<s> Yes!!!
<s> Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
<s> Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
<s> It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
<s> Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
<s> Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
<s> Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
<s> I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
<s> It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
<s> The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
<s> Amen. They cross themselves.
<s> Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
<s> Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
<s> No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
<s> Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
<s> Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
<s> Most of the time.
<s> Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
<s> Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
<s> Max...
<s> Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
<s> Of course.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Can't say that I do.
<s> Federal?
<s> Twenty five?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
<s> What thing?
<s> So?  It was a random thing.
<s> Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
<s> Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
<s> Try?
<s> You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
<s> By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
<s> Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
<s> ...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
<s> Oh.  Sorry.
<s> Yeah, yeah, sorry...
<s> Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
<s> Me, specifically?
<s> Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
<s> I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
<s> I'm cool.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's not me.
<s> Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
<s> They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
<s> What'd he do to you?
<s> Who was he?
<s> Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
<s> Why?
<s> It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
<s> Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
<s> Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
<s> It's not bullshit.
<s> Doesn't cover everything.
<s> No.
<s> Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
<s> You had to kill Heller?!
<s> Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
<s> None of your business.
<s> Vincent?
<s> Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
<s> I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
<s> Drop me off here!
<s> Shut the hell up.
<s> Motive?
<s> <u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
<s> You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
<s> Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
<s> <u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
<s> Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
<s> Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
<s> Do they have a secret handshake?
<s> You're certifiable.
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
<s> Is he dead?
<s> You watch me, don't you?
<s> Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
<s> Right here in Manhattan.
<s> What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
<s> Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
<s> Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
<s> I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
<s> Thanks.
<s> No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
<s> Not today.
<s> What's in Connecticut?
<s> How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
<s> Did you kill my father?
<s> Where were you the day he died?
<s> To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
<s> You do?
<s> They'll trace it.
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> Now she tells me.
<s> That's great.  Good for you.
<s> That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
<s> I'm leaning toward no.
<s> I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
<s> We're very specialized.
<s> Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
<s> If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
<s> Working.
<s> Working.
<s> Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
<s> Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
<s> Then this is a goddamn emergency.
<s> We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> I was just thinking that.
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
<s> I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
<s> Oh?  How's he doing?
<s> Meaning...
<s> I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
<s> We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
<s> Ellie.
<s> Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
<s> Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
<s> In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
<s> We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
<s> It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
<s> In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
<s> -- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
<s> I can't move any smaller.
<s> Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
<s> The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
<s> That's my girl...  Lights.
<s> Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
<s> Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
<s> Yavol.
<s> Any luck on the grant money?
<s> How close are you to getting this funding put together?
<s> 'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
<s> Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
<s> That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
<s> Like it or not.
<s> Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
<s> I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
<s> That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
<s> And mind, yes.  What are you --
<s> What'd you think?
<s> I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
<s> I'm sorry -- I can't --
<s> And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
<s> I do.
<s> Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
<s> Git movin', I said.
<s> I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
<s> I got two years.
<s> What are you doin' here?
<s> Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
<s> Gotta go, Arletta.
<s> Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
<s> I... I... I...
<s> Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
<s> Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
<s> Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
<s> Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
<s> Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
<s> We ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
<s> You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
<s> Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
<s> That fool. That damn fool.
<s> Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
<s> Gettin' up, Carr.
<s> Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
<s> Cuter.
<s> That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What did I do?
<s> Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
<s> Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
<s> I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
<s> I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
<s> And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
<s> You get me out first.
<s> What Friday?
<s> I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
<s> Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
<s> Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
<s> Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
<s> Where are you, Peter?
<s> You know where.
<s> Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
<s> That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
<s> Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
<s> For months... last October.
<s> I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
<s> Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
<s> You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
<s> What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
<s> I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
<s> It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
<s> Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
<s> I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
<s> He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
<s> That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
<s> Not yet.
<s> I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
<s> <u>What</u>?...
<s> Go and look for a note.
<s> I know, baby.  I know.
<s> He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
<s> She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
<s> Because it's your job, that's all.
<s> Oh, I know.
<s> Honest to God, Ruben!
<s> Let's get out of here...
<s> Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
<s> Helen... excuse me, we...
<s> Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
<s> Right.
<s> The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
<s> If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
<s> Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
<s> We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
<s> I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
<s> Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
<s> It is?
<s> I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
<s> Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
<s> I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
<s> The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
<s> Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
<s> I can drive.
<s> No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
<s> Yes.
<s> You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
<s> Where are you?
<s> I did this already.
<s> Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
<s> Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
<s> What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
<s> Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
<s> I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
<s> Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
<s> But everything's OK?
<s> Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
<s> Ecru.
<s> Wow.   Congratulations.
<s> And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> Green spot.
<s> It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
<s> It's magic.
<s> Wow.    I'm bad news.
<s> No way.
<s> I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
<s> Michael, I...
<s> You like it?
<s> Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
<s> Really?
<s> I like it.     But Headlines are better.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> Thanks.
<s> That's Mr. Beast to you.
<s> Sounds grim.
<s> I got worried. Are you OK?
<s> Congratulations.
<s> When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
<s> Why'd you tell?
<s> And all the plans we have.
<s> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
<s> Yes.
<s> Something you did?
<s> I think we need to talk about some things.
<s> I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
<s> It's, it's really nice, Paul.
<s> No.
<s> Oh.
<s> I start on Monday.
<s> I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
<s> So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
<s> Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
<s> You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
<s> C'mon, Laurant, America?
<s> Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
<s> Good.   I'm good.
<s> Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
<s> I assume you want something?
<s> I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
<s> Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
<s> Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
<s> What about the money?
<s> And the Vodka.
<s> You didn't buy batteries?
<s> Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
<s> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<s> I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
<s> Man, I can get anything.
<s> There's just one more thing I need you to do.
<s> Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
<s> Hard to say.
<s> You said don't do it, boss.
<s> Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
<s> A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
<s> This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
<s> She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
<s> How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
<s> I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
<s> Mr. Taylor?
<s> Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
<s> The baseball is mine.
<s> No.
<s> No!
<s> Fuck me?   Fuck you!
<s> I know where she went.
<s> Take a nap.
<s> No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
<s> Stick around and find out.
<s> You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
<s> I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
<s> How's the arm?  Still sore?
<s> Why were you spying on the Yus?
<s> That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
<s> Shut up!
<s> Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
<s> So what if I don't?
<s> She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
<s> I have a guest.
<s> Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
<s> Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
<s> I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
<s> I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
<s> Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
<s> Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
<s> Only the sword will settle this.
<s> What I've always wanted, to teach you.
<s> My comb!
<s> By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
<s> Jen...
<s> During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
<s> Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
<s> I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
<s> It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
<s> I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
<s> Shu Lien...
<s> That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
<s> I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
<s> Care for a hot dog?
<s> Annie, I need a file.
<s> Fucking A, my friend.
<s> It's only a flesh wound.
<s> How 'bout the morgue?
<s> Who?
<s> I can see her.
<s> Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
<s> 18k.  Crap.
<s> Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
<s> This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
<s> One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
<s> Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
<s> Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
<s> Really? I thought he said it all the time.
<s> On my mother's life.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
<s> You talking to me?
<s> Great book.
<s> Please.
<s> About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
<s> Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
<s> Why not?
<s> Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
<s> I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
<s> Who?
<s> I can't win with you.
<s> Who's Monsieur Philipe?
<s> You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
<s> What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
<s> Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
<s> You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
<s> Do you want to learn or not?
<s> Something awful happened last night.
<s> No.
<s> That's one way of looking at it.
<s> Just taking your photo.
<s> My mom? Don't call my mom.
<s> I swear.
<s> No.
<s> Baby?  Right on time.
<s> Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
<s> I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
<s> Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
<s> If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Okay.
<s> I hate it too.
<s> Cecile.
<s> So what went wrong?
<s> Screening calls. Any suggestions?
<s> I have a flair for drama.
<s> Not that it's any of your business but yes.
<s> Come again?
<s> Didn't you hear what I said?
<s> It's Cecile.
<s> Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
<s> It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
<s> Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
<s> Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
<s> Do you know where she is?
<s> Nope.
<s> How will I get to her?
<s> Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Oh, lots of times.
<s> Irena.
<s> You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
<s> I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
<s> She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
<s> I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
<s> Times have changed.
<s> No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Well, you know where it is.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Yes, daddy.
<s> But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
<s> And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, yes! I see Prince,
<s> That one's an elm.
<s> A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
<s> You wanted to share this moment with me.
<s> It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
<s> Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
<s> Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
<s> But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
<s> Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
<s> The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Why hasn't he got a head?
<s> The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
<s> I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
<s> Good night...Barbara...
<s> Wait a minute. Listen.
<s> Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
<s> I've changed a lot lately.
<s> Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
<s> I get crazy dreams and I black out.
<s> No it's mom.
<s> You're just saying that.
<s> What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
<s> And she got the medium.
<s> What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
<s> Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
<s> To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
<s> I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
<s> It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
<s> Okay. I guess so.
<s> It is so hot in here.
<s> It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
<s> Okay, I gotta go.
<s> Why not? There's been a murder.
<s> You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
<s> That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
<s> Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
<s> Did I kill a guy named Benito?
<s> Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
<s> No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
<s> Hey, how about a little nightcap?
<s> Since when do you care?
<s> No.
<s> Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
<s> Are you following me?
<s> No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Okay, you busted me.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
<s> Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
<s> No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
<s> Okay.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
<s> No, I said it was our first date.
<s> Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
<s> I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
<s> Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
<s> You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
<s> The park dude was missing an arm.
<s> She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
<s> Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
<s> I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
<s> And that was 28 days ago today.
<s> Looks like you need a haircut to me.
<s> Loose ends?
<s> I see...
<s> Who?
<s> What is going on?
<s> Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
<s> That's what people keep telling me.
<s> You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
<s> Nothing.  I don't know anything!
<s> We are...  living in their dreams...
<s> Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
<s> `Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
<s> A month.
<s> What the hell is this ?
<s> Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
<s> Fine.
<s> I can't believe he'd do this.
<s> Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
<s> The guy's in a coma, Bob.
<s> Like how?
<s> What about containment, Alan?
<s> And...
<s> No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
<s> It's fine.
<s> Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
<s> Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
<s> I'm not sure... I might have.
<s> In the car?
<s> I see what you mean.
<s> Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
<s> ... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
<s> 'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
<s> Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
<s> Fertility beads.
<s> I can't say.
<s> Certainly.
<s> The Vice-President...
<s> Thanks, Duane.
<s> Uh...
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Oh yeah?  Me, too.
<s> I don't know.
<s> He wasn't always like that, anyway.
<s> Yeah... Bedtime.
<s> I can't.
<s> Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
<s> What?
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah... It could be fun.
<s> We're working on it.
<s> Look.
<s> I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
<s> SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
<s> I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
<s> That sounds like a curse to me.
<s> I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
<s> Datura.
<s> Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
<s> They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
<s> Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
<s> No, sir.
<s> In the battle, sir.
<s> I don't think they're in school.
<s> Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
<s> Why? Nobody knows who we are.
<s> I couldn't stop myself.
<s> I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
<s> Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
<s> So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
<s> Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
<s> I think you're sweet.
<s> But...
<s> "O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
<s> Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
<s> That's not my fault.
<s> All right.  I'll second that.
<s> I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
<s> Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
<s> What good will that do?
<s> It does?  What?
<s> Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
<s> Just like that?!  You just knew?
<s> Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
<s> I didn't know you taught.
<s> I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
<s> A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
<s> Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
<s> Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
<s> Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
<s> Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
<s> What is it?
<s> I'll take him over mine.
<s> Thanks but  I'd better do history.
<s> I... I just don't want to come.
<s> As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
<s> Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
<s> You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
<s> No thanks.
<s> I'll come to the performance.
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> How soon can we get up and running?
<s> I have a schedule...
<s> You're going to have to get a new one.
<s> That's where my boat's moored.
<s> Well, you sure do a good imitation.
<s> Anti social?
<s> With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
<s> On the side!!
<s> You're saying they can think?
<s> A meat locker.
<s> What?
<s> Soon as I get over the heart attack...
<s> So?
<s> Forget them...
<s> Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
<s> Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
<s> I have been.
<s> Joey...
<s> Where is everybody?
<s> Maybe plans changed...
<s> John...
<s> 'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
<s> There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
<s> We're all going.
<s> You're full of shit.
<s> Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
<s> Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
<s> Married?
<s> Yeah.
<s> But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
<s> I came to see Merle.
<s> Everybody love Linda.
<s> I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
<s> Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
<s> You know a guy named Merle?
<s> Nick, she won't say why.
<s> Biederman, yes.
<s> Biederman!
<s> Oh... You know...
<s> I don't know! I don't know either!
<s> No.
<s> Oh, it's great. Fine.
<s> I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
<s> Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I... No. You do this for money?
<s> Playing.
<s> Nick.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
<s> From Nam?
<s> Pow.
<s> Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
<s> That's my plan.
<s> See you Monday.
<s> Nick. Hey. How's things?
<s> What?
<s> John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
<s> It's not socks, Sal.
<s> Naw.  Uh-huh.
<s> They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
<s> Sure.
<s> In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
<s> What'cha got, Bennett?
<s> Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
<s> When you bring in Doucet.
<s> I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
<s> You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
<s> Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
<s> You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
<s> How do I look?
<s> I got it.  I got it.
<s> Not the 'T' word.
<s> Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
<s> I'm not fond of television comedies.
<s> Bacon cheeseburgers.
<s> Trust me.  You don't want to know.
<s> You can't catch this man with a computer.
<s> 'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
<s> Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
<s> This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
<s> With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
<s> No, sir.
<s> ...Have you been drinking?
<s> Hospital food.
<s> I'm signing off.
<s> This is the guy that killed my partner.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My granddad was a policeman.
<s> Jabez! Careful --
<s> They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
<s> You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
<s> I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
<s> Sure am.
<s> Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
<s> That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
<s> I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
<s> About what?
<s> Never!
<s> Thank you, Mr. Webster.
<s> Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
<s> You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
<s> Yes -- at midnight.
<s> He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
<s> Jabez ...
<s> Jabez!
<s> Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
<s> Looks right elegant, Mary.
<s> Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
<s> I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
<s> Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
<s> Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
<s> I don't know, Jabez.
<s> It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
<s> Jabez!
<s> Hard luck -- like me.
<s> And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
<s> I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
<s> Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
<s> Mary -- Jabez --
<s> You aren't angry with me?
<s> Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
<s> You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
<s> Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
<s> Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
<s> Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
<s> I object.
<s> The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
<s> Why don't you?
<s> Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
<s> So, why didn't you come?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
<s> Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
<s> He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
<s> If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
<s> William Clay.  Call me Bill.
<s> One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
<s> I'm going to count to three...
<s> We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
<s> Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
<s> No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
<s> Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
<s> Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
<s> Thanks...partner.
<s> Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
<s> I still feel like shit.
<s> Then who the hell have you been talking too?
<s> -- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
<s> Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
<s> Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Jackie - what are you talking about?
<s> Well, how'll I get home?
<s> He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
<s> Well... I'm out of the hospital.
<s> You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
<s> Yeah.  So how are you?
<s> You don't have a choice?
<s> Are they on the phone still?
<s> All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
<s> Oh no!
<s> Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> ... armed robbery ...
<s> What else?
<s> He's all doped up.
<s> I can take care of that.
<s> Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
<s> Mulvaney...
<s> I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
<s> What now, Sonny?
<s> They look like good kids.
<s> Special to me, too.
<s> Sure - we like you.
<s> No, not until after they killed him.
<s> You're serious!
<s> Fuck him - let him out!
<s> Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
<s> How'd that happen?
<s> But I want to know what you think.
<s> All right ... send them the guard.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
<s> He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
<s> Okay, Sonny.
<s> I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
<s> What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
<s> It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
<s> You follow my car. 
<s> Sonny - Here's your document.
<s> What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
<s> No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
<s> Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
<s> Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<s> Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
<s> Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<s> How much?
<s> <i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
<s> <i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>

<s> <i>What happened to them?</i>
<s> <i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
<s> You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
<s> Yep.
<s> He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
<s> Take us to Vegas.
<s> That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]

<s> It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
<s> We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.

<s> You can't marry my mom.
<s> I'm sure you're overreacting.
<s> So, have you given him "some" yet? 
<s> Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
<s> Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
<s> What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
<s> He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
<s> And with that complete loser
<s> Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
<s> THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
<s> TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
<s> This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
<s> Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
<s> Let's just do it and get out of here.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Skateboard.
<s> Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
<s> Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
<s> Yes you are. 
<s> How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
<s> Everything. Just for the record.
<s> Piter.
<s> The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
<s> They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
<s> Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
<s> Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
<s> My Lord?
<s> Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
<s> Where are we do you think?
<s>  Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
<s> You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
<s> I'm ready.
<s> You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
<s> Always.
<s> You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
<s> Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
<s> I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
<s> Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
<s> SILENCE... SILENCE.
<s> Not all of them... I know which ones will.
<s> I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
<s> No.  I never drink -- wine.
<s> Huh?
<s> Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
<s> But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
<s> Who do I play?
<s> Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
<s> That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
<s> Eddie, you screwed up.
<s> You'll be fighting with the octopus.
<s> Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
<s> Has anyone ever been to Downey?
<s> I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
<s> I don't know.  Where?
<s> Don't you want a second take, for protection?
<s> No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
<s> Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
<s> Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
<s> Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
<s> Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
<s> Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
<s> I understand you just moved here?
<s> Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
<s> I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
<s> Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
<s> It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
<s> Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<s> Just, it doesn't look like very much.
<s> That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
<s> Tor!
<s> Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
<s> Yes?
<s> Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
<s> Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
<s> No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
<s> Oh.  Congratulations.
<s> Oh.  My condolences.
<s> I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
<s> The sun.
<s> What's uncanny?
<s> Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
<s> Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
<s> Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
<s> Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
<s> You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
<s> Went --
<s> This is real, Bananahead!
<s> Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
<s> Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
<s> When? Today?
<s> Right, right...
<s> He made a mistake.
<s> He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
<s> Mom?
<s> What's the matter?!
<s> I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
<s> Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
<s> Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
<s> You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
<s> Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
<s> Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
<s> Well, then I'm quitting.
<s> So maybe this is my dynamite.
<s> I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> You should see the one we wear when it rains.
<s> The what?
<s> I know, I ...
<s> Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
<s> Ohh...
<s> No. It's your fault.
<s> Come on.
<s> What are you drunk?
<s> Thumbsucker!
<s> Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
<s> No. What happened?
<s> You brought the cameras here!
<s> I know.
<s> Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
<s> Oh, man! So...
<s> Ed... I'm sorry.
<s> Thanks... That's ...
<s> No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
<s> That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
<s> That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
<s> You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
<s> Here, get down.
<s> Anything wrong?
<s> So nice
<s> Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
<s> Looks like Tim Kobza.
<s> Why are you lecturing me?
<s> And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
<s> You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
<s> My mother's buying me a new car for college.
<s> Would you sign it for me?
<s> Take as much room as you want
<s> Oh yeah, you bet.
<s> Sure.
<s> Here?
<s> Dave.
<s> We'll let it run awhile
<s> Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
<s> It's the only true thing I know anymore.
<s> A mistake?  That was no mistake.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
<s> I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
<s> No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
<s> Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
<s> What'd I do?
<s> I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
<s> You fuck for money.
<s> Yeah.
<s> When they deserve it.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
<s> Yeah.  But not for long.
<s> You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
<s> He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
<s> Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
<s> And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
<s> How?
<s> Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
<s> What was that boyfriend's name?
<s> It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
<s> We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
<s> You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
<s> Of course...
<s> He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
<s> Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
<s> Wait.  Our deal still holds?
<s> And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
<s> His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
<s> I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
<s> Answer yes or no.
<s> Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
<s> Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
<s> White's a mindless thug.
<s> And now you'll provide them.
<s> <u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
<s> Just don't shoot me.
<s> I want you to follow Bud White.
<s> A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
<s> Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
<s> He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
<s> He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
<s> I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
<s> None.  Call it a hunch.
<s> When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
<s> You lost me, Sid.  Who?
<s> No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
<s> What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
<s> Sid, cut the crap.  I --
<s> Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
<s> Showbiz.
<s> Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
<s> It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
<s> Really?
<s> The NSA?
<s> You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
<s> You told me no calls.
<s> Who?
<s> Why?
<s> What about newspapers and magazines?
<s> Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
<s> It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
<s> A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
<s> Neil, thank you for your help.
<s> Hello. Hello, Maria.
<s> I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
<s> Yes. I have her permission.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Something bad happened tonight.
<s> A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
<s> No.
<s> Well, you know--
<s> I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
<s> I know.
<s> It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
<s> I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
<s> A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
<s> Don't count on it.
<s> That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
<s> That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
<s> Brill.
<s> It's how he works.
<s> For the last four years.
<s> Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
<s> I <u>did</u> care how.
<s> It's not me?
<s> Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
<s> --otherwise we may have to--
<s> We'd rather not--
<s> L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
<s> Where's Stacy?
<s> Do I know you?
<s> Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
<s> Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
<s> I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
<s> Alright!
<s> What about jewelry?
<s> Rachel's dead?
<s> Why would they--
<s> To the cops?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I need help.
<s> You remember Daniel Zavitz?
<s> You would?
<s> We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
<s> He's clever. He had help.
<s> Sir--
<s> I just meant--
<s> We don't know.
<s> What about the tape?
<s> And if it wasn't?
<s> I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
<s> I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
<s> What kind of fossils?
<s> Hello!  Good morning.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> See what's happening to them - the stars.
<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
<s> Good.
<s> Now.
<s> Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
<s> It's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
<s> This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
<s> Would you let me pass?
<s> Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
<s> A surprise, he said.
<s> Don't talk.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
<s> Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
<s> Her hands and feet were tied.
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
<s> Don't cut me.
<s> You were in Africa?
<s> Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
<s> Ask him.
<s> What?  How could he have?  When?
<s> What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
<s> Oh really?
<s> Darling, for goodness' sake!
<s> I'm fine.  I got hot.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Apprentices.
<s> Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
<s> Thank you.
<s> K is for Katharine.
<s> Why?  Is he staying?
<s> Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
<s> There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
<s> I try not to expect you.
<s> That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
<s> I'll always go back to that church.
<s> I'm feeling old.
<s> This is making me incredibly angry.
<s> It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
<s> What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
<s> I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
<s> I don't recall asking your permission.
<s> Bingo.
<s> Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
<s> And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
<s> He's on to something bigger.
<s> The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
<s> If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
<s> That's my girl.
<s> I never carry...baggage.
<s> No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<s> I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
<s> As I recall, you've robbed it before.
<s> They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
<s> I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
<s> No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
<s> We get the Mask I'll tell you.
<s> Let's just see how we do.
<s> Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I've got something for you.
<s> To our...partnership.
<s> Terrified. Still am.
<s> My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
<s> Bookshelf. Sensors--
<s> In eye of that painting.
<s> It's a party.
<s> Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
<s> Behind you.
<s> Shut up.
<s> I always knew you'd do the job.
<s> Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
<s> My job, my rules.
<s> Transfer.
<s> Where the money is.
<s> No. You'll see when we get inside.
<s> Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
<s> Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
<s> It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
<s> That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
<s> It better be worth it for me.
<s> It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
<s> Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
<s> Thought you had to use some of these.
<s> You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
<s> We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
<s> Probably not.
<s> Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
<s> Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
<s> In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
<s> Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
<s> Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
<s> It's those files you asked for.
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
<s> Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
<s> I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
<s> Five million dollars.
<s> Yup.
<s> If you hadn't used profanity --
<s> You said things would be fine, and they're not.
<s> Where's Anna?
<s> Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Don't bother.
<s> Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
<s> So you think we got 'em scared?
<s> What, you think I'm made of money?
<s> And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
<s> That's crazy -- why not?
<s> Show me the document that proves that.
<s> Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
<s> I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
<s> Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
<s> Erin --
<s> The extortion, the threats ...
<s> Take it.
<s> That's right.
<s> Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
<s> There's more than one kind?
<s> Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
<s> It happens all the time.
<s> In the conference --
<s> Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
<s> You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
<s> Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
<s> Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
<s> C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
<s> Thanks for reminding me.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What?  But you been working so hard --
<s> No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
<s> I'm just saying --
<s> What do you want, a joke?
<s> Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
<s> You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
<s> That's okay.  I understand.
<s> Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
<s> It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
<s> The Emperor?
<s> Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
<s> You must.  Luke, look at me!
<s> But Han and Leia will surely die.
<s> What's wrong with him?
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> We're not out of this yet.
<s> Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<s> Barks his agreement.
<s> You know the Jedi Master?
<s> Then I'll see you in Hell.
<s> There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
<s> What is it?
<s> And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
<s> Forget it.
<s> No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
<s> I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
<s> Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
<s> This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
<s> I'm against that.
<s> Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
<s> That's quite a compliment.
<s> The entrance is collapsing!
<s> No lightspeed?
<s> The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
<s> Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
<s> It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
<s> Who's staring?
<s> ... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
<s> I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
<s> Hyperdrive.
<s> Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
<s> Yeah, you're a real hero.
<s> I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
<s> Luke needs help.  We must go back.
<s> That sounds familiar.
<s> Not yet.  They're working on it now.
<s> So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
<s> Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
<s> Well, what now?
<s> You are reckless!
<s> But I feel The Force flowing!
<s> You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
<s> Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
<s> Only what you take with you.
<s> Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
<s> It is the future you see.
<s> Never.
<s> But we saw Earth destroyed.
<s> Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
<s> Please
<s> Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
<s> C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
<s> Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
<s> We'll see.
<s> You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
<s> I see your point. What's the favor?
<s> Dream on, blue eye.
<s> I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
<s> Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Where'd they go?
<s> Looking to get out.
<s> Oh no, it's the Doctor.
<s> Who?
<s> You're running out of time.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I cannot--
<s> Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
<s> Move aside!
<s> You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
<s> Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
<s> Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
<s> Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
<s> Rise, Mordred.
<s> Your mother told you that?
<s> And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
<s> So be it.
<s> --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
<s> Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
<s> Not you, my husband?
<s> You, my lord.
<s> --Nothing!
<s> Twenty days!? The world is that big?
<s> Why?
<s> Just show the sword.
<s> Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
<s> Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
<s> Well what's wrong?
<s> Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
<s> Oh great, anything else?
<s> Burke.
<s> We have to start looking for a shrink.
<s> Storage.
<s> Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
<s> No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
<s> She is going to be well?
<s> No thanks Karl.
<s> Depression?
<s> You're kidding! Like what?
<s> Convulsion?
<s> No. Of course not, nothing like that.
<s> Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
<s> He didn't mention her.
<s> That depends.
<s> The priest.
<s> Could you see her?
<s> What else?
<s> You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
<s> Father?
<s> I found it.
<s> He's nice.
<s> Well, maybe he's sleeping.
<s> I don't know
<s> But you like him.
<s> So something please Doctor, Help her!
<s> That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
<s> Okay.
<s> In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
<s> Uoy era ohw.
<s> Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
<s> I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
<s> But deliver us from the evil one.
<s> In the face of the enemy.
<s> And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
<s> The Lord be with you.
<s> Amen
<s> Her heart.
<s> She'll go into coma.
<s> I've seen him.
<s> Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
<s> I don't know anyone who fits the description.
<s> No I probably wouldn't.
<s> Alright. You know who I think really did it?
<s> You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
<s> If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
<s> You wanted to see me, Charlie?
<s> Little slow tonight.
<s> Your pay.
<s> Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
<s> So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
<s> Swimming trunks.
<s> We have some lotion.
<s> You bring trunks, Jack?
<s> The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
<s> Out.
<s> Two nights.
<s> Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
<s> Huh?
<s> She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
<s> Only on odd days.
<s> Why the interest?
<s> You'll see.
<s> It's me.
<s> You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
<s> If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
<s> It's early.
<s> Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
<s> Come on, stand still.
<s> She's here.
<s> That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
<s> We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
<s> A few bars!
<s> Right.
<s> I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
<s> Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
<s> What?
<s> He was wearing a suit.
<s> No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
<s> Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
<s> It was just a can of beer, Frank.
<s> You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
<s> We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
<s> Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
<s> Who's weak now, big brother?
<s> What're you doing?
<s> A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
<s> The flu.
<s> It's one of Jack's favorites.
<s> The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
<s> Where's my name?
<s> Right.
<s> Piece of cake.
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> Maybe.  I'll call him.
<s> For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
<s> Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
<s> Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
<s> Smells like tuna number two to me.
<s> Great.
<s> I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
<s> I'll call you.
<s> Gotta go.
<s> I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
<s> Come on, Ed.
<s> Regular hours are eight to five.
<s> You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
<s> Frank works hard.
<s> For a while.  She left.
<s> Every year.
<s> Like a baby. You?
<s> Better than that.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Sure.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> So, what happened?
<s> Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
<s> There's always another girl.
<s> Yeah.  Got my own sign.
<s> What happened to the donut king?
<s> Yeah?
<s> They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
<s> ... Thanks.
<s> Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
<s> How old is he?
<s> A few blanks?  Like what?
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
<s> No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
<s> Just make sure you're there.  On time.
<s> You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
<s> You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
<s> Five seconds.
<s> Not if I kill you first ...
<s> Shoot him!
<s> I'm going to have you fired.
<s> That's your name, isn't it?
<s> What happened?
<s> What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
<s> Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
<s> Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
<s> It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
<s> The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
<s> Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
<s> Great.
<s> That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
<s> Whats going on here?
<s> Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
<s> Got it.  Good tip.
<s> Big Eds.
<s> Like what?
<s> I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
<s> Kates my wife...
<s> Its just two kids, right?
<s> It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
<s> Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
<s> No.
<s> Hey...
<s> Look Jack Im late.  Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
<s> You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
<s> Are we what, Jack?
<s> Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
<s> Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
<s> Howd you do this year, Tony?
<s> Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
<s> Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
<s> ...my feet are hurtin...
<s> Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
<s> I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
<s> Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
<s> Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
<s> Thats why I work for Big Ed?
<s> Worse, you mean...
<s> I guess...some of them are probably faking.
<s> Its good to see you...
<s> What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
<s> But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
<s> I'd like that, too.
<s> I like the sound of that.
<s> This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
<s> <u>Should</u>?
<s> Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
<s> Ben.  Are you okay?
<s> This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
<s> I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
<s> Oh, he did.
<s> Victor must've taken him.
<s> I can go hotter!
<s> Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
<s> They're not costumes.
<s> Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
<s> But all these people...
<s> Stay right.  Left is trouble.
<s> Last one down springs for room service.
<s> <u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
<s> Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
<s> You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
<s> And if he's not...?
<s> Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
<s> <u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
<s> You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
<s> So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
<s> It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<s> Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
<s> It's been changed.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> Passion.
<s> I'm sure I can come up with something.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
<s> I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
<s> A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<s> Just <u>find</u> him.
<s> I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
<s> No...
<s> That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
<s> The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
<s> Brain injury.
<s> Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
<s> That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
<s> Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
<s> No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
<s> You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
<s> Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
<s> I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
<s> Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
<s> I can't till the hatch is flooded!
<s> Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
<s> All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
<s> Quite a piece of plumbing.
<s> They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
<s> No, there's no other way.
<s> It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
<s> We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
<s> Two in a row?
<s> Sorry, but the situation has changed.
<s> Where we going?
<s> I'm married.
<s> Uh -- what?
<s> Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
<s> Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
<s> What's this, sir?
<s> Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
<s> I don't think so. It's nice.
<s> ...What're you talking about?
<s> What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, that's not it, Jerry.
<s> Yeah, you already said that.
<s> Oh, for Chrissakes here -
<s> Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
<s> Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yah, got a front movin' in.
<s> In what way?
<s> And what about the other fella?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> They're playin' the Buckeyes!
<s> Ya kiddin'!
<s> Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
<s> Dad's here.
<s> No, no, fax is -
<s> All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
<s> Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
<s> You told me about it.
<s> A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
<s> I know it's a lot.
<s> ...There's a million dollars here!
<s> Well - it's cold, Margie.
<s> I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
<s> Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
<s> Aw, you can sleep, hon.
<s> Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
<s> It sounds like you're doin' really super.
<s> It's okay...
<s> It's okay, Mike...
<s> So?
<s> Nope.
<s> Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
<s> We've got a -
<s> We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
<s> His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
<s> Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
<s> Congratulations, Jerry.
<s> Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
<s> Oh.
<s> Here are your flight coupons.  Call me from the road if there are any snags.  Your itinerary...
<s> Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
<s> Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
<s> No, I wasn't aware...
<s> What?
<s> It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
<s> -- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
<s> You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
<s> I don't know -- am I?
<s> I suppose.
<s> What... ?
<s> Don't worry, I'm leaving.
<s> Good.
<s> Here.
<s> No... no problem.
<s> Whatever.
<s> What?
<s> The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
<s> Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
<s> No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
<s> Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
<s> Who's this?
<s> I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
<s> Yes... it's a test.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
<s> Okay, everyone.
<s> The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
<s> And, now it's gone.
<s> Delivered from Martha Stewart.
<s> It affords him other interesting opportunities.
<s> You get the idea.
<s> Like hell.  That counted.
<s> Strange.
<s> Call what off?
<s> What car?
<s> Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
<s> Doesn't matter.
<s> Shatner.  William Shatner.
<s> Any historical figure.
<s> A liposuction clinic.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Fucking sweet.
<s> I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know!  Tell me!
<s> Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
<s> Um, well... technically, no.
<s> If you know, I know.
<s> This is not about martyrdom.
<s> I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
<s> What?
<s> Paraffin.
<s> Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
<s> What?
<s> Well, sir, you said you might.
<s> No!
<s> What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
<s> Too much school.
<s> I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
<s> Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
<s> Taken care of.
<s> Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
<s> That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
<s> Yeah, you should have specified.
<s> Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
<s> No.  What's this about?
<s> Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
<s> Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
<s> That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
<s> How does a nice mature fuck sound?
<s> There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
<s> Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
<s> I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
<s> Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
<s> I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
<s> What feeling?
<s> I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
<s> I know, we'll be there soon.
<s> Nice try, kiddo.
<s> Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
<s> We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
<s> They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
<s> Easy, Billy, just open it.
<s> Get out! Get out of the car!
<s> Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
<s> C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
<s> "Next?"
<s> I know who you are.
<s> In Death...
<s> You saying Tod did kill himself?
<s> No harm. No foul.
<s> Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
<s> I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
<s> WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
<s> Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
<s> Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
<s> This is state-of-the-art firepower.
<s> There's a compass in the handle.
<s> Exactly.
<s> She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
<s> Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
<s> Duck soup.
<s> Nguyen is good boy.
<s> It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
<s> Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
<s> We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
<s> We just take pictures?
<s> POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
<s> Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
<s> Well, I guess I'll come back then.
<s> It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
<s> I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
<s> I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
<s> Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
<s> Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
<s> Two kids tried to set me on fire.
<s> I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
<s> Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
<s> <u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<s> "I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
<s> You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
<s> I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
<s> I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
<s> It was a crime.
<s> All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
<s> Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
<s> Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
<s> No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
<s> Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
<s> My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
<s> They're --  -- What?
<s> Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
<s> Funny -- you look married.
<s> I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
<s> What?
<s> What are the other reasons?
<s> I know!
<s> <u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
<s> I don't like horror movies!
<s> Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
<s> No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
<s> Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
<s> Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
<s> I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
<s> You're playing the other side.
<s> Serveza yourself!
<s> You can sing the song.
<s> Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
<s> Shut up! All of you!
<s> Okay...
<s> I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
<s> No.
<s> You're lucky no one was hurt.
<s> But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
<s> Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
<s> Are you talking to us?
<s> Am I on TV?
<s> You know who it once belonged to?
<s> Who's Van Oost?
<s> A couple of months.
<s> Uhm hmm.
<s> Why are you being so mean?
<s> Yeah, well, he's...
<s> My turn.
<s> Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
<s> Then after that?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
<s> I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
<s> Yes, that's what's important to me...
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Is he?
<s> Of course I'd like to.
<s> I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
<s> No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
<s> Is she?
<s> All right, let's have a rematch.
<s> You're all full of shit!
<s> For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
<s> Jesus, what a rude person...
<s> I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
<s> And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
<s> Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
<s> Aaron, how you doin'?
<s> God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
<s> Victor.
<s> Um. Yeah! Shorty!
<s> No.  What you do today?
<s> I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
<s> You got a boyfriend?
<s> I buy them flowers.
<s> I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
<s> I can't man, I'm punished!
<s> Pitt.
<s> If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
<s> Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
<s> For real?
<s> 'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
<s> So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
<s> Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
<s> You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
<s> Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
<s> Well, which one?
<s> There is?
<s> Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
<s> I'm serious, Sam.
<s> Gum thought Brazil.
<s> Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
<s> Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
<s> How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
<s> Yes. Where you from, Harry?
<s> Since he moved to L.A.
<s> What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
<s> Fletch?
<s> What's that?
<s> Fletch, I never sold nothing.
<s> Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
<s> My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
<s> You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
<s> In this drawer....
<s> You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
<s> You sure those doors will be open?
<s> Can I steal you for a minute?
<s> Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
<s> You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
<s> Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
<s> John Ultrarelamensky.
<s> You are a rich woman.
<s> I'll take you to a game.
<s> Act natural.
<s> In her cabana, sir.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
<s> And a damn fine one, I might add.
<s> ...never reads the paper...
<s> Why not? Oh shit... really?
<s> He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
<s> Who? Donnie and Marie?
<s> You were going to can me, right?
<s> I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
<s> Don't say it.  Orange juice?
<s> Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
<s> Oh... I have some questions.
<s> So you...
<s> Have what?
<s> We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
<s> Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
<s> I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
<s> Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
<s> You're not funny.
<s> Peachy.
<s> Why are all these people after me?
<s> It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
<s> No, wait...
<s> Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
<s> There's that question...
<s> Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
<s> What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
<s> Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
<s> Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
<s> Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
<s> Ciao.
<s> It is to us!  It's computerised.
<s> I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
<s> No. 
<s> No - no.
<s> You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
<s> My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
<s> What?
<s> He got off on six.
<s> Names.
<s> Where the hell is it?
<s> Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
<s> Policy man in Queens.
<s> Suspicion of what?
<s> This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
<s> We put him to bed for the night.
<s> Why is it called Hellgate?
<s> I been damn careful up to now.
<s> Baltimore?
<s> I'm alright, Gibby.
<s> Elvis has left the building.
<s> Wish you weren't.
<s> Okay...
<s> I know.  He loves that thing.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
<s> Luck, my ass.
<s> Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
<s> No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
<s> I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
<s> No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
<s> This afternoon?
<s> Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
<s> Nothing...I just spilled something.
<s> What's happening?
<s> Too busy playin' ball, huh?
<s> It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
<s> I lost you.
<s> Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
<s> No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
<s> No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
<s> What...
<s> Better.
<s> Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
<s> So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
<s> I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
<s> No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
<s> I hear that.
<s> Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
<s> We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
<s> According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
<s> Cool it, Andy.
<s> That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
<s> I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
<s> What?
<s> You promised you'd never ask me.
<s> Stick around and you'll see.
<s> It was nothing.
<s> Don't say any more.
<s> Great.  Just great.
<s> Why?
<s> Sheriff, you better take this.
<s> You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
<s> All he's asking is for you to check it out.
<s> Did you hear me?!
<s> No, he was real.  Like on TV.
<s> No more.
<s> But what I get scared again?
<s> They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
<s> Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
<s> Skin stretcher was human.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know everything about you, Diana.
<s> I'm now begging you.
<s> Okay.
<s> Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
<s> You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
<s> There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
<s> No.
<s> I packed it. Just for us.
<s> Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
<s> He is not.
<s> She didn't push me into coming.
<s> I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
<s> Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
<s> What about not-so-great writers?
<s> Just felt a little chill.
<s> Really?
<s> That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
<s> It's not that simple.
<s> Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
<s> No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
<s> Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
<s> I'd love to.
<s> Alla puttanesca.
<s> Do not inhale.
<s> I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
<s> What do I exude?
<s> Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
<s> I say we go.
<s> We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
<s> `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
<s> This could be it.
<s> You know about Adele.
<s> Our Peter?
<s> Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
<s> We don't even like each other, do we?
<s> I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
<s> And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
<s> Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
<s> Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> There's nothing left for me to lie about.
<s> First you tell me.
<s> All right. What's been going on?
<s> That's always been my problem.
<s> She's my gynecologist.
<s> I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
<s> Washed away.
<s> I'm at the door.
<s> Pop, will you let me in?
<s> You know the answer to that.
<s> He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
<s> That's my cousin, Angelo.
<s> I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
<s> Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
<s> Why do you care?
<s> A little.
<s> Alla puttanesca.
<s> I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
<s> Is what true?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
<s> Stop!
<s> No. That is what you get for distracting me.
<s> Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
<s> How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
<s> He said he's in charge...
<s> It was one incident.
<s> That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
<s> You will respect the law.
<s> That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
<s> Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
<s> My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
<s> I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
<s> An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
<s> That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
<s> It's split the Government.
<s> ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
<s> It's for the best.
<s> Now is your chance to find out.
<s> I like football.
<s> Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
<s> With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
<s> Where do we start?
<s> Where did you get this?
<s> This time I will supervise each test personally.
<s> I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
<s> <i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
<s> You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
<s> It's okay, Eugene.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
<s> I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
<s> If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
<s> Michael's.
<s> You may as well invite her here.
<s> I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
<s> German, is that you?
<s> Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<s> Why not?
<s> In the South Wing.
<s> You'll be next.
<s> I'll tell you at the end of the week.
<s> Stay clean.
<s> They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
<s> That Beynon's got a long arm.
<s> Fatter... some things never change.
<s> I'm still here, Doc.
<s> It's all right.
<s> Really.
<s> Suit yourself.
<s> But sometimes I cried a lot too.
<s> If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
<s> I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
<s> There wasn't any way to explain it.
<s> Why, there's nothing on the news?
<s> You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
<s> I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
<s> Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
<s> Where do we go from here?
<s> Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
<s> I really hope you have a nice trip.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Tell her you robbed a bank...
<s> What about you?
<s> I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
<s> What about the vault?
<s> Whatever you need.
<s> Aren't we going a little hard?
<s> He took the day off.
<s> You serious?
<s> I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
<s> How about twenty thousand?
<s> Just... tell us what you want.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> What about?
<s> Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
<s> Doreen.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. I can't help the way I am.
<s> He was gentlemanly. I like that.
<s> No, do you really?
<s> Really?
<s> So where are we going, Princess?
<s> Of course. Where else?
<s> He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why would it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll bet this one's seen some action.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
<s> No. Are you tired?
<s> What you doing around here then?
<s> Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
<s> The gun he means.
<s> Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
<s> I had to.
<s> I'd never try to sell an Indian.
<s> You get a bad month, all of a...
<s> You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
<s> Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
<s> Himself?
<s> You...
<s> Someone should hurt them.
<s> What? 
<s> The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
<s> Talking about it as a...
<s> As a robbery.
<s> What will he pay?
<s> Yes.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> No.
<s> ...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
<s> That's right.
<s> I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
<s> Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
<s> They stole the...
<s> They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
<s> No.
<s> I was at home, where were you?
<s> No.
<s> Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
<s> Would you excuse us, please.
<s> They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
<s> Levene!!
<s> Could I...
<s> And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
<s> Shelly, you blew the last...
<s> ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
<s> And what if you don't close.
<s> I saw the board.  You've got four...
<s> It's not impossible.
<s> No, I don't think so, Shel.
<s> No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
<s> Only the beginning...
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Last night, this morning.
<s> Mmm.
<s> Like you taught me...
<s> ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
<s> He's right, Williamson.
<s> Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
<s> Sure.
<s> Home cooking...
<s> No, his wife is.
<s> Kenilworth...?
<s> Kenilworth.
<s> I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
<s> Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
<s> Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
<s> Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
<s> I'm not.
<s> If we wait till Mon...
<s> Tuesday.
<s> The check wasn't cashed?
<s> Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
<s> I...
<s> Guess who?
<s> ...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
<s> You did?
<s> Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
<s> Yes.
<s> I got lots of presents.
<s> The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
<s> Oh yes, the very best.
<s> I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
<s> Tom is right.
<s> I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
<s> Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
<s> I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
<s>  You must understand, this is all new to me...
<s> We're making an investment in Havana.
<s> Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
<s> Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
<s> But, you told me yourself...
<s> What is it?  Can I help?
<s> I've always taken care of you.
<s> He's an Italian?
<s> I'm going to see my parents.
<s> How long does this go on?
<s> We don't know that's true, he never said that.
<s> Sure, Mikey.
<s> Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
<s> No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
<s> No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
<s> Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
<s> It was a boy.
<s> I know he's in Israel.
<s> His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
<s> Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
<s> Twenty-five this time.
<s> He's going to try Panama...
<s> The room has a bug in it.
<s> Did my brother go back?
<s> You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
<s> I don't think that's necessary.
<s> He is, I believe, a brother.
<s> Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
<s> Goodbye, Michael.
<s> At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
<s> Right here.
<s> Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
<s> The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
<s> Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
<s> No.
<s> I do not.
<s> I do not.
<s> No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
<s> In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
<s> Just thinking out loud.
<s> What's to be jealous of?
<s> The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
<s> That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
<s> A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
<s> He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
<s> But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
<s> Just that I was in the Marines.
<s> They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
<s> Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
<s> I'm not wearing an undershirt.
<s> What?
<s> I don't like to talk about that.
<s> No.  I could have, though.
<s> I'm not, you know.
<s> What happened?
<s> How long were you...?
<s> Cut it out!
<s> You first.
<s> Not me.
<s> Not fear.  More like disgust.
<s> There's no people like you in my crowd.
<s> You were a soldier?
<s> I didn't --
<s> Run for what?
<s> Catch my death.
<s> Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
<s> The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
<s> I thought you'd given up on my picture.
<s> The Great War?
<s> A very lucky thing indeed.
<s> Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
<s> "A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
<s> What was that?
<s> All right.
<s> Fuck off!
<s> I think I'll hang around.
<s> I just want to watch it, okay?
<s> I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You didn't, Jimmy.
<s> You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
<s> Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
<s> You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
<s> Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
<s> Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
<s> Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
<s> Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
<s> Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
<s> I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
<s> I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
<s> Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
<s> I don't mind.
<s> Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
<s> I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
<s> Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
<s> A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
<s> Who do you think?
<s> Yes ... Kip ...
<s> I don't want him hurt...
<s> They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
<s> "don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
<s> This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
<s> By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
<s> How's Atley -- ?
<s> You know my back.
<s> Kip.
<s> I don't think so, Detective ...
<s> Double-meaning intended, right?
<s> You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
<s> Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
<s> Gray.
<s> Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
<s> Dignity...
<s> one minute -- !
<s> No ... And they won't take my calls ...
<s> Atley Jackson came to see me ...
<s> Of course ...
<s> You guys are through...
<s> "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
<s> You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
<s> Something like that -
<s> Otto called -
<s> "Shadow games?"
<s> How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
<s> I'm cool.
<s> Thought I'd go for a ride -
<s> What for -- ?
<s> Run it...
<s> The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
<s> Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
<s> Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
<s> Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
<s> That what you want?
<s> Oh. Okay. Right.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> I think so... They're just... So ...
<s> You're going high-cheese, dude --
<s> Woo-woo-wooooo!
<s> They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
<s> Wrong preposition...
<s> Yeah ... You -- ?
<s> Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
<s> He's gotten involved --
<s> The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
<s> And the moral of that story is -- ?
<s> Who's "Eleanor?"
<s> So she flies -
<s> Look at Jeannie's kid.
<s> Oh I Him.
<s> Wha?  Me?
<s> Why would I get into that?
<s> Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
<s> Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
<s> How much?
<s> What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
<s> I don't want to hear about her anymore.
<s> What did he say, exactly?
<s> Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
<s> What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
<s> Jimmy.
<s> Nah.
<s> Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
<s> What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
<s> He heard.
<s> Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> He's with his friends.
<s> Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
<s> But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
<s> But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
<s> But, Paulie, please.
<s> All right, then.
<s> What are we gonna do up there?
<s> We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
<s> Probation, counselin', few days a week.
<s> Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
<s> Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
<s> Ah, history I think.
<s> See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
<s> Well, I don't have no trousers on...
<s> What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
<s> Yah, all right...
<s> Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
<s> Why don't you beat off at your house?
<s> Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
<s> You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
<s> That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
<s> It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
<s> With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
<s> No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
<s> Really?
<s> Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
<s> An integer.
<s> Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
<s> Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
<s> I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
<s> I did.
<s> I got your card.
<s> They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
<s> Just meet with the boy once a week.
<s> It's on the college.
<s> Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
<s> Hold on!
<s> He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
<s> Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
<s> I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
<s> He's not you!
<s> Come in.
<s> I don't got a crush on her.
<s> Will, your not getting off that easy.
<s> Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
<s> If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
<s> Yeah, it did take me a long time.
<s> You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
<s> You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You ever think about gettin' remarried?
<s> I gave that up when my wife got sick.
<s> You're kiddin' me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
<s> I didn't ask for this.
<s> You're not going to fail me are you?
<s> No.  Have you had any experience with that?
<s> It's not...
<s> You're Welcome, Will.
<s> I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
<s> I'm Will.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
<s> Yes you were.
<s> Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
<s> We'll do that.
<s> If you bring the caramels.
<s> I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
<s> Fine.
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> So, do you play the piano?
<s> No.
<s> I can't go out to California.
<s> You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
<s> I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
<s> Joe!
<s> You're *ticklin' me!*
<s> Now I can't breathe.
<s> I guess that's what he looked like.
<s> Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
<s> Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
<s> Joad. Tom Joad.
<s> An' you say no cops?
<s> I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
<s> You got dances too?
<s> No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
<s> That's our place.
<s> Casy! What you doin' here?
<s> No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
<s> You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
<s> Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
<s> If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
<s> Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
<s> No longer'n we can get acrost her.
<s> No plants.
<s> No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
<s> This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
<s> Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
<s> Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
<s> How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
<s> It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
<s> Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
<s> She'll be awright.
<s> I'm ready.
<s> You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
<s> No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
<s> Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
<s> I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
<s> I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
<s> I could hide you, Tommy.
<s> Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
<s> You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
<s> How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
<s> I don't understan' it, Tom.
<s> Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
<s> But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
<s> It ain't nobody. It's a company.
<s> Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
<s> California, here we come!
<s> I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
<s> Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
<s> We gonna stay, ain't we?
<s> Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
<s> I never--
<s> Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
<s> In the corporate offices.
<s> I sell BMW's. What do you do?
<s> Fine, Bob. How are you?
<s> A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
<s> It's nice to see you again.
<s> I'm a professional killer.
<s> Where have I been?
<s> No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
<s> Well, there's not much to tell.
<s> What?
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> I'm staying here.
<s> If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
<s> Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
<s> Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
<s> Like a club. Work less, make more.
<s> Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
<s> Okay.
<s> Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
<s> I guess.
<s> Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
<s> Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
<s> Tell them my house exploded.
<s> It's a place where religious people--
<s> I have a headache. You have a headache?
<s> I think I'll go see Debi today.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I have always thought about her and missed her.
<s> Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
<s> I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
<s> He sold me this bad boy.
<s> See you in ten years.
<s> It is cocktail hour yet?
<s> Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
<s> You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
<s> Fine!
<s> I brought it to you in the hospital.
<s> I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
<s> What?
<s> Don't they believe in signs here?
<s> I think they call it a pasture.
<s> Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
<s> I'll take care of it.
<s> Did you go riding?
<s> ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
<s> FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
<s> What?
<s> I should be in by two.
<s> She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
<s> Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
<s> I love you.
<s> Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
<s> He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
<s> You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
<s> Night.
<s> You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
<s> May I have a suggestion?
<s> I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
<s> Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
<s> They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
<s> I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
<s> Promise?
<s> I understand, but Annie, please...
<s> Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
<s> I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
<s> You're catching on.
<s> I want to watch.
<s> Can I come? I'll start a fire...
<s> Why don't we just cut through the woods?
<s> No, not yet.
<s> Maybe... look -- just...
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
<s> I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
<s> Don't move!
<s> Hack the Planet!
<s> ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
<s> See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
<s> Dragon book. Compiler design.
<s> The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
<s> What is it with this guy?
<s> That's far out!
<s> Go fix the phones.
<s> Curtis.
<s> Yeah? Display?
<s> I'm taking over a TV network.
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
<s> And unpack.
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
<s> That's bullshit.
<s> How did you know that?
<s> My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
<s> P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
<s> Are you challenging me?
<s> Uh, hold on...
<s> This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
<s> Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
<s> It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
<s> You would have looked better.
<s> Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
<s> Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
<s> We caught 'em.
<s> I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
<s> I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
<s> 555-4202.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Okay sure. What about?
<s> I don't know Brady.
<s> Michael Myers.
<s> Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
<s> Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
<s> I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
<s> No way. No how.
<s> Like a real sister?
<s> I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
<s> Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
<s> But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
<s> I can't.
<s> Dad, what's going on?
<s> Why?
<s> All right.
<s> Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
<s> Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
<s> Its not over yet.
<s> What are we doing?
<s> Got it Ben.
<s> He's been here.
<s> Evil.
<s> You blame everything on kids.
<s> All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
<s> I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
<s> Look where?
<s> Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
<s> Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
<s> I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
<s> He was watching me.
<s> Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
<s> Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
<s> Yeah.
<s> I thought you were gonna get one for me.
<s> He isn't a man.
<s> He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
<s> If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
<s> I don't think so...
<s> Sure.
<s> Sure. Sure.
<s> Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
<s> See you.
<s> I don't like that story.
<s> Yes.
<s> Let's make more popcorn.
<s> You're coming with us...
<s> He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
<s> Shouldn't we pick him up?
<s> Oh, is that what it is?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
<s> Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
<s> Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
<s> Really?  Is the food that bad?
<s> Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
<s> Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
<s> Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
<s> Oh.  Well, I live--
<s> Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
<s> Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
<s> Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
<s> Well, sure.
<s> Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
<s> Yes, he's just adorable.
<s> Why?
<s> Poor Hannah.
<s> Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
<s> I care a great deal about him, yes.
<s> I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
<s> Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
<s> I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
<s> What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
<s> Leave me alone, can you?!
<s> You're not lost.
<s> Oh, honey!
<s> But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
<s> I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
<s> I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
<s> Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
<s> Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
<s> Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
<s> Why?
<s> Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
<s> Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
<s> Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
<s> Wow!
<s> Well, what about artificial insemination?
<s> Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
<s> True.
<s> Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
<s> Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<s> Oh, yeah. 
<s> Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
<s> Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
<s> I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
<s> Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
<s> Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
<s> Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
<s> Really?
<s> So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
<s> Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
<s> Oh, well.
<s> It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
<s> God.
<s> I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
<s> You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
<s> Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
<s> I'm going to tell you later....
<s> Some museum director disappeared.
<s> ...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
<s> Or, perhaps...
<s> He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
<s> And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
<s> Let's keep it to business, shall we?
<s> COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
<s> M'I gonna see you tonight?
<s> Then I'm doing fine.
<s> Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
<s> They got that kind of money?
<s> Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
<s> ...Let's see the pigs, please.
<s> Have the child taken to bed.
<s> OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
<s> The children...?
<s> I've never heard that he...
<s> He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
<s> ...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
<s> I can make you rich.
<s> Shut up, Starling...
<s> Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
<s> You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
<s> Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
<s> A wonderful country...
<s> I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
<s> You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
<s> I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
<s> Enchante.
<s> Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
<s> Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
<s> Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
<s> Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...

<s> Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
<s> You goddamn bitch!
<s> We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
<s> Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.

<s> No.
<s> Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
<s> But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
<s> S'okay....
<s> Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
<s> That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.

<s> I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed.

<s> What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.

<s> I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
<s> What picture?
<s> I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
<s> Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
<s> Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
<s> You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
<s> Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
<s> Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.

<s> No, no, no, no.
<s> That would be stupid.
<s> Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.

<s> Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!

<s> High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.

<s> What?
<s> All new houses have noises.
<s> One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
<s> I know someone else who's sensitive.
<s> Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
<s> There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
<s> Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
<s> Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
<s> Philip!  The senior partner?
<s> He wasn't there.
<s> I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
<s> I'm having the floor fixed,
<s> Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
<s> We'll talk in the morning.
<s> Do you have enough money?
<s> Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
<s> Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
<s> Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
<s> Can we keep him?
<s> No.
<s> Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
<s> They appear to be authentic.
<s> Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
<s> No.
<s> He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
<s> Is that it?
<s> No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
<s> That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
<s> I learned my fill from Romeriz.
<s> There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
<s> Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
<s> I think you just like to eat dirt.
<s> And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
<s> How?
<s> What are you hoping to find inside?
<s> No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
<s> I remember you.
<s> Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
<s> You got me.
<s> New York is dangerous place.
<s> I'm interested in mythology.
<s> You?
<s> He will not stop until it is over.
<s> Get out.
<s> What's that next to him?
<s> It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
<s> That's what the Kurgan said.
<s> I know.
<s> No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
<s> I love you, Conner.
<s> I'll no forget you.
<s> There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
<s> If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
<s> Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
<s> You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
<s> We're on foot.  We can't get away.
<s> You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
<s> That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
<s> I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
<s> We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
<s> I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
<s> We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
<s> Okay.
<s> Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
<s> Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
<s> I overheard him with the girl.
<s> You said they would be here!
<s> Where is it?
<s> If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
<s> We'll see you in a couple of hours.
<s> We can't make the microwave work.
<s> Stop it.
<s> He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
<s> All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
<s> What's that, Chief?  Say again.
<s> Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
<s> Go, Chief.
<s> Go.
<s> You have her cell number?
<s> And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
<s> Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
<s> Are all of you named Jones?
<s> What?
<s> Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
<s> Can you get into the office?
<s> Who is it?
<s> How do I reach him?
<s> These disks . . . where are they?
<s> I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
<s> Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
<s> We, who is we?
<s> I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
<s> Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
<s> And four children?
<s> I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
<s> We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
<s> Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
<s> We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
<s> Their people?
<s> The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
<s> As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
<s> Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
<s> The police are very busy.
<s> I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
<s> You said you had no whiskey.
<s> No, sir.
<s> I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
<s> I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
<s> I am on a list! What list?
<s> Politics is power, Paul. And money.
<s> Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
<s> Why not? We are half way there already.
<s> Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Thank God.
<s> Why sir?
<s> They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
<s> The third floor are low class rooms.
<s> Pack the bags, we have to move.
<s> I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
<s> Of course.
<s> No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
<s> Jean Baptiste!
<s> I sent them home. Go and call them.
<s> What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
<s> It will do just fine.
<s> What are you saying, Tatsi?
<s> Go out! Where?
<s> How dead?
<s> Many beers.
<s> It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.

<s> Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
<s> No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
<s> I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
<s> I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
<s> Left, goddamnit!
<s> Yes.
<s> The...Fourth of July.
<s> It's not going to let us out!
<s> Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
<s> Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
<s> -- listen to the man --
<s> You've got your own TV show?
<s> I hope not.
<s> You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
<s> -- the sadistic prick --
<s> Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
<s> Question answered.
<s> Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
<s> Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
<s> -- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
<s> -- my loss --
<s> Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
<s> Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
<s> -- no more --
<s> No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
<s> Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
<s> He must've unsealed the room!
<s> The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
<s> There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
<s> Yes.  It was.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Well I bet you they're happy.
<s> Go to your room!  Now!
<s> Where is she?
<s> For good luck honey.
<s> That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
<s> Don't be afraid!
<s> I just, I don't know...
<s> Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
<s> I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
<s> And you...are?
<s> Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
<s> Yes, they are.
<s> So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
<s> Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
<s> Runic?
<s> Not at all, if it can help.
<s> Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
<s> And what did you discover?
<s> He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
<s> The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
<s> Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
<s> Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
<s> No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
<s> Buying some drugs, alright?
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> I don't know.  Maybe.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Wow.  Thank you.
<s> And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
<s> What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
<s> Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
<s> But how in God's name ...
<s> Something like that.
<s> Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
<s> Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
<s> I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
<s> Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
<s> No need.  Guards' station's right there.
<s> What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
<s> Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
<s> Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
<s> Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
<s> But I said I was sorry....
<s> "But we'll be the same as we started...
<s> I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
<s> I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
<s> Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
<s> Prison?
<s> Oh.  Well, what's this?
<s> You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
<s> You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
<s> Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
<s> Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
<s> I guess that's a no.
<s> What job?
<s> You certainly do.
<s> It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
<s> I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
<s> The Hipster!
<s> It's hardly the same --
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
<s> Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
<s> Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
<s> Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
<s> No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
<s> You don't say.
<s> That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
<s> Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
<s> Phony, huh?
<s> Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
<s> Says who?!
<s> I'm sure you do.
<s> Forty-eight years...
<s> What the heck they doin'?
<s> This I know, Benny.
<s> ...Geez.
<s> Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
<s> Get up!
<s> Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
<s> Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
<s> But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
<s> Sir, my leg is on fire!
<s> Ya get the special?
<s> Thank you for waking me.
<s> Where?
<s> Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
<s> I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
<s> It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
<s> I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
<s> I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
<s> That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
<s> I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
<s> I am not a frightened girl.
<s> If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
<s> Of course not!
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
<s> I often do.
<s> I love Fort Holland.
<s> You didn't drive her mad.
<s> This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
<s> I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
<s> Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
<s> Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
<s> You want to go?
<s> Stuffed and baking.
<s> Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
<s> I know, I know. I had no idea --
<s> Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
<s> Birth control.
<s> Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
<s> Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
<s> Good night kiddo.
<s> Nah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> C'mon.
<s> Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
<s> You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
<s> What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
<s> Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
<s> Well, we can talk about it.
<s> Hi Wendy.
<s> We were just riding around.
<s> You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, it was -- I ended up --
<s> All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
<s> Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
<s> Let's see!
<s> Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
<s> What is it?
<s> Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
<s> That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
<s> Who said so?
<s> I don't have a girlfriend.
<s> Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
<s> Charles, what time is it?
<s> What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
<s> Vodka?
<s> Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
<s> We already did.
<s> The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
<s> It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
<s> I don't remember.
<s> Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
<s> You know what about.
<s> To do nothing.
<s> Habit.
<s> Huh?
<s> Huh?
<s> Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
<s> After that she left the party to go to him.
<s> Long as it's fun.
<s> That's what I said.
<s> What was it?
<s> Yes down at the station.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
<s> Yes, and very beautiful.
<s> Then there is nothing.
<s> Then God does not exist...
<s> We can do that?
<s> Yes... My God...
<s> Louis, I swear I did not.
<s> I have. Or there would be twice as many.
<s> It will grow back again!
<s> Does it?
<s> I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
<s> And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
<s> Then my luck would have changed.
<s> You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
<s> Dying?
<s> And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
<s> No...
<s> Don't try to speak... it's alright...
<s> I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
<s> Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
<s> We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
<s> Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
<s> Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
<s> But it has. There is no more to tell.
<s> If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
<s> What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
<s> Yes!
<s> And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
<s> Yet. Nothing yet.
<s> Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
<s> Where is everyone? I'll ask --
<s> He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
<s> Yes.
<s> We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
<s> I've got to see.
<s> Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
<s> No, you're not.
<s> Can't what?
<s> Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
<s> Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
<s> You know me to well.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
<s> What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
<s> It beets being on the mainland.
<s> It's...him.
<s> Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
<s> Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
<s> We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
<s> They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
<s> Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
<s> How much?
<s> Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
<s> Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
<s> Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
<s> What is up with that weirdo?
<s> Drunk again?
<s> Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
<s> Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
<s> Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
<s> This was once a cemetery.
<s> I donut understand.
<s> I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
<s> We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
<s> Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
<s> On my word! That's what they believe.
<s> I do not know him, but I have seen him.
<s> You have forgotten my last name?
<s> Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
<s> Yes?
<s> Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
<s> How did she die?
<s> Listen to what I say --
<s> I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
<s> Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
<s> You see? Thea believes it, too!
<s> The General threatened me.
<s> For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
<s> So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
<s> All right  all right.
<s> Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
<s> Don't . . . George?
<s> What are you, a mind reader or something?
<s> Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
<s> Made what?
<s> Why? Don't they believe in angels?
<s> There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
<s> Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
<s> Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
<s> That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
<s> Well, wait and see.
<s> Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
<s> The Building and what?
<s> They went out of business years ago.
<s> It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
<s> Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
<s> Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
<s> I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
<s> I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
<s> Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
<s> Well, she's not crazy about him.
<s> Ummmm . . .
<s> Yes  charge.
<s> Look, Nick. What's wrong?
<s> Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
<s> You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
<s> Come on, George, let's hurry.
<s> Hello, Vi.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
<s> Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
<s> The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
<s> What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
<s> Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
<s> You've passed me on the street almost every day.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> You may kiss my hand.
<s> Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
<s> Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
<s> Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
<s> Have you made up your mind?
<s> Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
<s> But of course.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I was counting on hours.
<s> Too hot in the lighthouse?
<s> We're hung up on something.
<s> Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
<s> You're betting what you already got.
<s> Want to swim home?
<s> You bet.  Hang on....
<s> Aren't you off-duty?
<s> If there is, develop it!
<s> About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
<s> Please.  It's my job.
<s> Hey -- you can't do that.
<s> Got it.
<s> Oh, c'mon.
<s> At least you're safe.  What about the others?
<s> All of us thank you, okay?
<s> Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
<s> My ass!
<s> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
<s> Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
<s> Can't you tell?
<s> And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
<s> It's good with coffee.
<s> Damn.
<s> Terrific.
<s> Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
<s> It's still a good idea.
<s> Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
<s> What?
<s> 10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
<s> Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
<s> Sure they did....
<s> Seventeen.  She's a senior.
<s> Great.
<s> Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
<s> Who'd you ask?
<s> Next week.
<s> Double nope!
<s> I dunno.  We'll think of something.
<s> And second?
<s> No.
<s> I love it.
<s> I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
<s> Brody's riding his tower.
<s> He thought he had a good reason.
<s> So?  So?
<s> And a missing man.
<s> You buying?
<s> Yeah.  Down there.
<s> What is it, 97 days?
<s> He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
<s> That's a lot of ground to cover.
<s> Nothing.
<s> That we swim.
<s> Make up your mind.
<s> Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
<s> Sounds wonderful.
<s> Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
<s> How's your patient?
<s> ... He ought to put him in here.
<s> Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
<s> Only to myself.
<s> I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
<s> So do I, love.
<s> We're taking that shark alive!
<s> Because I don't trust you, that's why.
<s> Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
<s> Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
<s> Somebody could have gotten hurt.
<s> We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
<s> Thanks to you.
<s> Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
<s> She, Mister Hutton.
<s> He's missing.
<s> How you doing, Kelly?
<s> Massachussettans aren't.
<s> I don't know, it depends.
<s> Hold still, damn it!
<s> Don't you dare.
<s> What the hell's there?
<s> That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
<s> It's large enough...
<s> No way.
<s> I want to see Kathryn.
<s> It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
<s> Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
<s> It sure is....
<s> We need milk....
<s> No....
<s> I don't know....
<s> I like it.  Really....
<s> He heard that.
<s> You can stay in my room.
<s> Who's coming?
<s> Mother....
<s> You guys must be starving....
<s> I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
<s> Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
<s> Good.  So will I....
<s> Mom, please don't start that again....
<s> Trying to write our report....
<s> I have to get this finished.
<s> No.
<s> There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
<s> First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
<s> Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
<s> They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
<s> Nothing....
<s> That's hard to imagine....
<s> Won't you get in trouble...?
<s> Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
<s> You got a better idea...?
<s> It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
<s> The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
<s> What's that....?
<s> Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
<s> Still chasing fish?
<s> Inch by inch....
<s> I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
<s> Forget it....
<s> Don't say anything about this to my mother....
<s> Maybe it's gone....
<s> Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
<s> Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
<s> I've got to get to her....
<s> The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
<s> I'm the one who wanted to study it....
<s> I'm training to....
<s> When he has a pillow over his head....
<s> We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
<s> Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
<s> Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
<s> A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
<s> O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
<s> You want me to stop the car?
<s> You looked like you did?
<s> I'm asking it.
<s> Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
<s> Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
<s> I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
<s> I guess by the bed.
<s> That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
<s> I don't see that at all ..
<s> I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
<s> Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
<s> Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
<s> Maybe he's lying to you?
<s> How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
<s> Wrong cabinet.
<s> I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
<s> How d'you know what I'm like?
<s> Really? What did he say?
<s> Which is what?
<s> I know.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> I know about alcohol, John.
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
<s> Two or three years ago.
<s> I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
<s> Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
<s> His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
<s> I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
<s> I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
<s> You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
<s> Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
<s> Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
<s> I see what you're saying.
<s> Just be friendly and say "no comment."
<s> You're imagining it.
<s> My son... my mind...
<s> Well, take care.
<s> Hello?
<s> Well, I'm happy for you.
<s> Do you have something to drink?
<s> Mission... statement...
<s> Good evening.
<s> Fine, I just --
<s> Well, when you wonder, ask me.
<s> That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
<s> Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
<s> Ten seconds, Rod.
<s> Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
<s> Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
<s> Mmm.  Hmm.
<s> Huh?
<s> No.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> That's your word?
<s> But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
<s> You.
<s> Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
<s> But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
<s> I'm a little worried --
<s> Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
<s> Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
<s> Tell me, and then you can sleep.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
<s> I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
<s> That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
<s> Nothing you haven't seen before.
<s> I filmed this the morning they left.
<s> Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
<s> Eric!
<s> Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
<s> Think.
<s> But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
<s> What about Eric?
<s> Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
<s> They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
<s> We'll be broke in four weeks.
<s> It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
<s> KEEP GOING!
<s> You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
<s> It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
<s> A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
<s> Then we go home?
<s> No. I couldn't see.
<s> I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
<s> Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
<s> This plane can not land!
<s> Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
<s> But you never came across just one.
<s> Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
<s> If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
<s> Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
<s> -- my --
<s> -humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
<s> Everyone, keep your voices down!
<s> Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
<s> I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
<s> Which one?
<s> That was about a year ago.
<s> What?  Why?
<s> Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
<s> Isn't it obvious?
<s> Good.
<s> Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
<s> What do you think they want?!
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
<s> Why did you come here?
<s> Why should they?
<s> What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
<s> What?!
<s> We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
<s> Where's Ian?
<s> None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
<s> What now?
<s> Uh - - about two million.
<s> Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
<s> Shhhhh!
<s> These are dilated.  Take a look.
<s> Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
<s> We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
<s> A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
<s> John....
<s> Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
<s> The Cretaceous.
<s> Small versions of adults, honey.
<s> We're out of a job.
<s> Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
<s> Not just every six weeks.
<s> - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
<s> You can't hold it by yourself!
<s> No, no, no!
<s> We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
<s> No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
<s> When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
<s> Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
<s> Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
<s> That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
<s> What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
<s> But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
<s> Why?
<s> I know.
<s> We gotta do something.
<s> The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
<s> After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
<s> I'll stay awake.
<s> It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
<s> Please!
<s> You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
<s> Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
<s> Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
<s> They don't bother me.
<s> What?
<s> Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
<s> And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
<s> Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
<s> You have a map.
<s> Compared to this guy... amateur.
<s> He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
<s> Who's chest?
<s> I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
<s> A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
<s> None of that's true?
<s> That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
<s> Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
<s> Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
<s> I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
<s> It was Krueger, wasn't it?
<s> Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
<s> Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
<s> For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
<s> Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
<s> Up there.
<s> You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
<s> Success or nothing?
<s> There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
<s> What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
<s> In a manner of speaking.
<s> What an extraordinary request!
<s> Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
<s> Sit down, Kafka.
<s> Why would you suppose so?
<s> One of you must be mistaken.
<s> That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
<s> Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
<s> Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
<s> You won't have any trouble finding it.
<s> At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
<s> Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
<s> First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
<s> Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
<s> Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
<s> No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
<s> Well -- other departments are, yes.
<s> No, I suppose not.
<s> Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
<s> These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
<s> She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
<s> We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
<s> And we're upset too.
<s> A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
<s> Value? ... Value?
<s> There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
<s> Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
<s> They' re dead.
<s> Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
<s> A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
<s> That's your monkey, Denham.
<s> Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
<s> Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
<s> Nab- Let's get it over with.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What about him? Yes.
<s> Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
<s> Don't belong?
<s> You think people hate you.
<s> Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
<s> Like for you to look for the man.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
<s> He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
<s> What about everything since?
<s> How would I remember?
<s> What do you think?
<s> No, I said what did you think.
<s> Why?
<s> We did this before.
<s> Don't touch anything.
<s> Right back at the start, right?
<s> You're going back?
<s> Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
<s> It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
<s> It's got to make sense some way.
<s> Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
<s> Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
<s> It's not so bad.
<s> It's in the report.
<s> Has she talked with you since prison?
<s> Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
<s> He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
<s> No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
<s> Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
<s> Detroit.
<s> Greatest...
<s> Show...
<s> No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
<s> C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
<s> Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
<s> I hate it.
<s> I'm allergic to onions.
<s> No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
<s> No.
<s> No!
<s> Good night.
<s> See you in the morning light...
<s> It's my name too.
<s> Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
<s> No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
<s> I don't understand, daddy.
<s> Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
<s> Overruled.
<s> Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
<s> While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
<s> It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
<s> What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> What about Billy?
<s> I don't know...
<s> So do you.
<s> Such as?
<s> Ted, do you love him?
<s> Oh, God...Oh, my God...
<s> I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
<s> What?!?
<s> Kramer--
<s> Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
<s> I can't tell you how sorry I am.
<s> Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
<s> No.
<s> Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
<s> I'm gonna keep him, why?
<s> Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
<s> Yes. I am ready.
<s> Kham, Holiness.
<s> Khambas are wild men.
<s> Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
<s> No!
<s> I will not approve it.
<s> All?
<s> Then, we shall meet.
<s> He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
<s> Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
<s> We do not know.
<s> I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
<s> Answer. 
<s> Look here!
<s> At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
<s> I will not go.
<s> Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
<s> You will always!
<s> You cannot.
<s> I would not know. Maybe.
<s> Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
<s> We have.
<s> How could I ever leave?
<s> What would you do, Holiness?
<s> Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Thank you.
<s> <u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
<s> Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
<s> And you like me.
<s> Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
<s> No crocodile has ever--
<s> I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
<s> You talk to Bickerman?
<s> I never had sex with you!
<s> No.
<s> We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
<s> I <u>told</u> you.
<s> Who?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Good.
<s> I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
<s> Night.
<s> Ssssh!
<s> Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
<s> Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
<s> So does he.
<s> Where is he?!
<s> Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
<s> <u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
<s> I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
<s> Look.
<s> Wait.
<s> Kevin, hey.
<s> It's ten after nine.
<s> It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<s> It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
<s> Kelly--
<s> Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
<s> Why not?
<s> Hot damn, Clarice.
<s> I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
<s> Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
<s> Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Who's the subject?
<s> You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
<s> I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
<s> You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
<s> I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
<s> Let's get some coffee and talk.
<s> Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
<s> Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
<s> Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
<s> I think so.
<s> I'm - still in training at the Academy.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then please - do this test for me.
<s> Big through the hips. Roomy.
<s> After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
<s> How long did you live there?
<s> Why so briefly?
<s> Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
<s> But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
<s> Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
<s> I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
<s> Let us go, miss.
<s> Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
<s> ...never doubt what you are doing.
<s> I have nothing to go back for.
<s> There was none!
<s> Yes. Yes, I will.
<s> We were headed...
<s> I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
<s> Your enemy...
<s> Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
<s> Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
<s> ...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
<s> What did you see, Major?
<s> Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
<s> General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
<s> The decision is final.
<s> For Munro children?
<s> This interview's over! The militia stays!
<s> And this?
<s> They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
<s> France.
<s> He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
<s> The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
<s> Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
<s> Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
<s> What?
<s> Why can't we pick up his signal?
<s> Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
<s> I'm not anxious to find out, either.
<s> Do it.
<s> The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
<s> Russian.
<s> Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
<s> He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
<s> I'm going to kill it!
<s> Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
<s> I don't know.  I'm guessing.
<s> Well, it's still a good idea.
<s> I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
<s> Jesus, Tom, do they work?
<s> Well what?
<s> Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
<s> It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
<s> Can I help?
<s> Just carrying a bag.
<s> All right, Dad.
<s> We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
<s> What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
<s> I mean it, there is only three of us here.
<s> We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
<s> I want your bar.
<s> All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
<s> Well, perhaps you can help?
<s> What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
<s> Seven hundred each.
<s> That's going on optimism.
<s> You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
<s> Er, well, twelve.
<s> That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
<s> Oh, come on, Amado--
<s> I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> The--the officers.
<s> I mean, follow orders, sir.
<s> I do, sir.
<s> Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
<s> They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
<s> Thank you, Sergeant Major.
<s> Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
<s> There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
<s> Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
<s> I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
<s> So that's him--
<s> I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
<s> Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
<s> Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
<s> He never asked her.
<s> The Trail of Tears.
<s> I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
<s> He's still pissed off about it.
<s> "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
<s> You own this place?
<s> You lived in the States for a while?
<s> We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
<s> You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
<s> Maybe.
<s> Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
<s> If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
<s> We should just do it.
<s> I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
<s> You know who it was they dug up?
<s> Appreciate it, sir.
<s> It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
<s> We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
<s> Why would you want to do that?
<s> Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
<s> I have some friends who have had a accident--
<s> We have a daughter.
<s> --Santiago.
<s> Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
<s> Do you?
<s> People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
<s> He was killed.
<s> I never said that.
<s> That's me.
<s> We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
<s> What was your deal with him?
<s> He ever accept cash for a favor?
<s> Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
<s> Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Yeah.
<s> He hates me.
<s> Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
<s> I came back 'cause you were here.
<s> Two years.
<s> I've felt that way, yeah.
<s> Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
<s> You'd do a good job.
<s> That the problem, son?  You Slow?
<s> This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
<s> Hell of a spot to put a business.
<s> You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
<s> How?
<s> I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
<s> Deep shit?
<s> What about death?
<s> You'll do more.than that.
<s> It's him... it's him.
<s> Does that mean...?
<s> I'm no bodyguard.
<s> When do you want me to start?
<s> That's my business. Harry.
<s> It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
<s> Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
<s> Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
<s> Some or it.
<s> I wasn't.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Harry-?
<s> Good.  There.  Yes?
<s> Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
<s> He got up and walked.
<s> For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
<s> I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
<s> You know of him?
<s> Probably.
<s> No.
<s> Have you been in?
<s> Now I'm going to have to kill you.
<s> He deserved it.
<s> I don't know what else to do.
<s> Is that all?
<s> And you're not?
<s> And he didn't have them?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Not true.
<s> Yes.
<s> We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
<s> Two years.
<s> Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
<s> No, how about you?
<s> I know, it's stupid.
<s> No.
<s> Hi, Charlie.
<s> Ok.
<s> Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
<s> Do you want to have some breakfast?
<s> I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
<s> Yeah, look at that thing.
<s> No, we'll find something around here.
<s> Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
<s> Yes, no.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes?
<s> Hello, darling.
<s> Good-night.
<s> Bob?
<s> Fine. Is it going ok?
<s> Do you want to- 
<s> Bye.
<s> What?
<s> I gotta go to work.
<s> Ok, I will... later.
<s> Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
<s> Are you sure you have to go?
<s> Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
<s> It'll just be a few days.
<s> Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
<s> Do you think they have a room here?
<s> Says she can get me in to see this killer.
<s> You need to believe in something besides yourself.
<s> You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
<s> Peter, are you okay?
<s> My secretary?
<s> He will.  He has great faith.
<s> Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
<s> I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
<s> Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
<s> You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
<s> Father, I'm right here.
<s> ...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
<s> What's his name?
<s> In the end, the jury saw it my way.
<s> Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
<s> Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
<s> Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
<s> Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
<s> It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
<s> Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
<s> What?
<s> That's true.
<s> I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
<s> What are these?
<s> You are the younger of two...
<s> I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
<s> No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
<s> Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
<s> So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
<s> Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
<s> Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
<s> I can't eat before a game.
<s> To that stewardess?
<s> You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
<s> Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
<s> This time get your feet set.
<s> You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
<s> Thanks.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
<s> Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
<s> Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
<s> The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
<s> I'll take that as a compliment.
<s> Never let a freshman take your spot.
<s> What's up, Sidra.
<s> It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
<s> My Dad always drives my Mom.
<s> Your legs don't look broke.
<s> She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
<s> Would you watch the damn road?
<s> I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So you took Shawnee, huh?
<s> I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
<s> I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
<s> Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
<s> I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
<s> I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
<s> Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
<s> Hey, what's up.
<s> I never asked you to choose.
<s> No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
<s> Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
<s> For what?
<s> Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
<s> Business folks.
<s> Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
<s> What are you doing in my room?
<s> Okay.
<s> Yup.
<s> This is just about money, you know that.
<s> So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
<s> "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
<s> You know, people.
<s> You came out early.
<s> What?
<s> I mean, it's not true, is it?
<s> We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
<s> Your door was unlocked.
<s> No.
<s> ooohhhhhh no.
<s> Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
<s> It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
<s> I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
<s> I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
<s> baby, please, please --
<s> Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
<s> Did you hear what I said?
<s> You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
<s> Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
<s> This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
<s> If you're not here for a 422 --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I thought you were flirting with me a little.
<s> Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
<s> No, no.
<s> Can I tell you something?
<s> What?
<s> You don't know how crazy I am.
<s> You mind if I come in, check things?
<s> yeah, yes, hi, hello.
<s> Sure, why?
<s> We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
<s> It's ok, boy.
<s> You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
<s> That's confidential information, little man.
<s> -- and I'm through playin' games.
<s> He's doing the interview with the lady --
<s> Fine.  Phil, you still there?
<s> Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
<s> This sounds threatening.
<s> Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
<s> Gently, son --
<s> "It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
<s> Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
<s> PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
<s> -- memory?
<s> Hi.  Is Frank there?
<s> Is this 509-9027?
<s> Alright.  Thank you.
<s> Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
<s> This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
<s> Hollywood, mainly.
<s> He passed away.
<s> From '84 to '89.
<s> ...are you Phil...?
<s> Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
<s> Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
<s> ...ok...
<s> Quietly, slow down, whoa --
<s> Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
<s> No one else in here?
<s> Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
<s> If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
<s> I need you to get me Paula --
<s> Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
<s> No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
<s> Well maybe.
<s> I'm not through asking my questions.
<s> I don't know what I've done.
<s> Hello.  Is Claudia here?
<s> Yes.  What's your name?
<s> No.  But I probably will get a call back.
<s> I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
<s> If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
<s> Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
<s> You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
<s> You need to sober up.
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> ....it's alright....
<s> Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
<s> Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
<s> What do you do?
<s> Sure.
<s> Alright.
<s> Hi.
<s> It's not right.
<s> This happens....this is something that happens.
<s> That is good.
<s> If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
<s> D'Artagnan.
<s> We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
<s> I wish to discuss your brother.
<s> Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
<s> I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
<s> Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
<s> Yes, and he has a choice!
<s> Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
<s> Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
<s> We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
<s> The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
<s> Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
<s> Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
<s> Who?
<s> We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
<s> Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
<s> Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
<s> I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
<s> What is its antidote?
<s> I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
<s> She will be at the ball.
<s> You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
<s> ... tired.  Must... lie down.
<s> Yes, your Majesty.
<s> I... we are humble people...
<s> Sire, I --
<s> Yeah?
<s> If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
<s> Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
<s> So what?
<s> It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
<s> It's just...catching up with me, you know?
<s> It wasn't in the cards.
<s> Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
<s> That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
<s> No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
<s> I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
<s> No.
<s> Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
<s> Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
<s> No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
<s> I'm not going anywhere!
<s> Hop in.
<s> Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
<s> We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
<s> Not with this...
<s> Then what did you do, play canasta?
<s> Where is he?
<s> I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
<s> I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
<s> What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
<s> What else did you keep out of the papers?
<s> The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
<s> You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
<s> As long as they're dead...
<s> He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
<s> Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
<s> Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
<s> No.
<s> There's no connection between the families.
<s> There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
<s> What?
<s> Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
<s> Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
<s> I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> It's a surprise.
<s> Francis? Where are you?
<s> Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
<s> Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Please, no.
<s> Dr. Chilton.
<s> I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
<s> Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> No. I can help you.
<s> You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
<s> I don't think I'll tell you.
<s> Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
<s> None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
<s> Tell me about yourself.
<s> Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
<s> I have to see somebody.
<s> Blue, then.
<s> Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
<s> I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
<s> Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
<s> I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
<s> Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
<s> I keep getting it for Christmas.
<s> It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
<s> I thought you would have some ideas.
<s> There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
<s> Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
<s> That's interesting.
<s> Yes. I'd considered it.
<s> ...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
<s> George, I hate sitcoms.
<s> I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
<s> But George, I like to push the boundaries...
<s> I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
<s> Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
<s> That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
<s> No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
<s> Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
<s> Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
<s> But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
<s> But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
<s> Hi... am I late?
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
<s> Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
<s> Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
<s> I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
<s> No!  Andy, don't do it --
<s> Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
<s> Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
<s> Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
<s> I'll take my chances!!
<s> Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
<s> I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
<s> Er, yes.  Speaking.
<s> So your name's not Gorsky.
<s> Why isn't he MOVING??
<s> Hurry!
<s> You all look the same to me.
<s> Oh shit.
<s> I don't know... My computer...
<s> Go.
<s> Shit!  Apoc?
<s> What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
<s> Yes.
<s> But what if...?
<s> It's an honor.
<s> Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
<s> Show me.
<s> Your mind makes it real.
<s> What -- what lesson?
<s> How?
<s> No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
<s> She would say she knows enough.
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
<s> Do it!
<s> Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
<s> That's different.
<s> No.
<s> A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
<s> It might have been.  I'm not sure.
<s> I have to.
<s> Tank, it's me.
<s> You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
<s> I can't!
<s> Let go of her.
<s> Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
<s> Can't we come with you?
<s> No.
<s> And say what?
<s> Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
<s> Should I slap him?
<s> Don't worry.  I can handle it.
<s> Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
<s> That's not going to help.
<s> Good idea.
<s> He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
<s> Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
<s> You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
<s> I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
<s> You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
<s> Fine.
<s> Teresa.
<s> Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
<s> Here.
<s> Charlie...?
<s> Well you can't blame them in a way.
<s> I know...I know.
<s> Sal!... fourteen street.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
<s> Well...no.
<s> You think so?
<s> Love that name.
<s> Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
<s> Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
<s> Who?
<s> Annie made them.
<s> That you've been to Susan?
<s> Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
<s> That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
<s> That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
<s> Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
<s> What side of the industry did you say you were on?
<s> Cold.
<s> Yes.
<s> Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
<s> Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
<s> 'Just kidding'?
<s> For how long?  And why?
<s> Please, Drew.
<s> The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
<s> Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
<s> You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
<s> 'It's up to Joe'?
<s> Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
<s> No, no.  I on holiday.
<s> Didn't the family get together last night --?
<s> It's so very nice to see you again.
<s> I didn't know that.
<s> No.
<s> You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
<s> I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
<s> Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
<s> I don't know who you are.
<s> I loved it.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> And you can't tell me who you are.
<s> You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
<s> That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
<s> Good night to you, Bill.
<s> 'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
<s> You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I guess so.
<s> Not this.
<s> No.
<s> I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
<s> This part I'm interested in.
<s> I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
<s> I wouldn't put it that way.
<s> Are you going to fire me, Bill?
<s> Goodnight.
<s> That's okay.
<s> Then I can't help you.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
<s> This universe?
<s> I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
<s> Yes?
<s> Say again?
<s> Well, they're mine now.
<s> Get him in here.
<s> Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
<s> I'll take it from here --  I am --
<s> Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
<s> What you were talking about.
<s> Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
<s> Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
<s> Yes, Bill.  The question.
<s> Good morning, Quince.
<s> Thank you, Quince.
<s> Next week?
<s> Yeah, I give a shit.
<s> Does Drew tell you everything?
<s> I am.  With you.
<s> Nothing.  I'm sorry.
<s> Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
<s> It's something.
<s> Where's he going?
<s> I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
<s> Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
<s> I could be her.
<s> How 'bout another cup of coffee?
<s> Did I say something wrong?
<s> But we've got time.
<s> It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
<s> From what?
<s> It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
<s> Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
<s> That's the thing. I have this condition.
<s> As requested.
<s> Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
<s> Yeah?
<s> Thanks.
<s> But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
<s> Tell me about her again.
<s> Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Yes.
<s> And what did he say?
<s> Somebody's come. Already.
<s> Calls himself Dodd.
<s> Help me.
<s> I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
<s> Can I ask you something?
<s> Are you Teddy?
<s> You're in a playful mood.
<s> I don't remember.
<s> Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
<s> Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
<s> What's wrong with this one?
<s> She's involved with these drug dealers.
<s> 'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
<s> No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
<s> That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
<s> Yes, I will.
<s> You can't just take it!
<s> His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
<s> Turn around.
<s> Recruit us to do what?
<s> Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
<s> Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
<s> ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
<s> Make it 35.
<s> You do.
<s> Okay.
<s> It goes very fast.
<s> Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
<s> She's dead...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Zero risk.
<s> Really?
<s> A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
<s> ...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
<s> I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
<s> He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
<s> And what do I do with him?
<s> What'd Neptune tell you?
<s> Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
<s> Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
<s> The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
<s> White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
<s> It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
<s> And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
<s> Twenty on my man...
<s> Then you should.
<s> How do I discuss operations over an open line?
<s> We don't know.
<s> Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
<s> Yes.  What's up?
<s> Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
<s> "Future" of...?
<s> You set this up!
<s> You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
<s> It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
<s> Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
<s> Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
<s> Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
<s> I mean, dammit, where you live?
<s> This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
<s> I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
<s> Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
<s> Don't say nothing about you either.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
<s> What?
<s> Get outta my way.
<s> Well, not too, I mean, a little.
<s> Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
<s> Ready for anything.
<s> Get down -- where?
<s> Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
<s> History, man, history. How much?
<s> We go through the wall?
<s> KNOCK IT OFF!
<s> Ziat!
<s> Stop shitting me, man!
<s> I know.
<s> Beats working.
<s> Twelve years.
<s> Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> And?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
<s> Cut his fucking throat.
<s> You can't take anything seriously.
<s> Cat, ah!  Ayip!
<s> That's a great philosophy.
<s> Mr. Yesil.
<s> Who?
<s> Who got the Frenchman out?
<s> Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
<s> Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
<s> Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
<s> Right.
<s> You got a better way up?
<s> Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
<s> Go!! Just go!!
<s> He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
<s> Across both tracks!!
<s> No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
<s> But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
<s> Manny...
<s> We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
<s> Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
<s> I was just late.
<s> Toss the flare down!
<s> That's camouflage...
<s> No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
<s> Just like Trump Tower, then.
<s> I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
<s> Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
<s> Fuck! It broke the skin...
<s> What?
<s> You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
<s> It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
<s> I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
<s> That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
<s> You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
<s> I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
<s> No, just the paper will be fine.
<s> You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
<s> I want my pills NOW!
<s> What?
<s> A toast?
<s> I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
<s> You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
<s> You don't know?
<s> He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
<s> Oh, I like that tone.
<s> What is it?
<s> So do I...
<s> I'm sure you're right.
<s> It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
<s> Hugh, I'm impressed..
<s> Well that depends.
<s> Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
<s> In downtown Sydney for a start.
<s> You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
<s> I knew where it was.
<s> Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
<s> Then we got'em!
<s> And the check's in the mall.
<s> He's heading down the stairs, now..
<s> Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
<s> Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
<s> Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
<s> Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
<s> Ethan Hunt.
<s> Care to wait a decent interval?
<s> So do I.  Sort of.
<s> Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
<s> Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
<s> Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
<s> Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
<s> Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
<s> Why did you phrase it like that?
<s> 'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
<s> - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
<s> Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
<s> Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
<s> She sacrificed herself..
<s> Yes, I gathered as much.
<s> Yes.
<s> They'll kill me.
<s> Yes, Anatoly, yes.
<s> Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
<s> Roger that.
<s> What happened to Jim?
<s> Who is they, who is they?
<s> I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
<s> Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
<s> Why was there another team?
<s> I see you've been out visiting the folks.
<s> You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
<s> Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
<s> I'll get you close.
<s> Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
<s> Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
<s> I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
<s> Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
<s> How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
<s> What about Job?
<s> We'll see.
<s> You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
<s> He's our guy.
<s> We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
<s> You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Youre probably right.
<s> Of course I can hear you.
<s> Jack...that's spying.
<s> That's not so good for you, my friend.
<s> Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
<s> He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
<s> I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
<s> Ti amo.
<s> Alright. I didn't see you here.
<s> You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
<s> They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
<s> Yes. Do you want...
<s> I know that. I do what I want.
<s> You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
<s> All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
<s> You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
<s> I've never seen a moon like that.
<s> Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
<s> Awful?
<s> I think that's it.
<s> He didn't come!
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
<s> Hi.
<s> Johnny.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> On the floor?
<s> How about a month from today?
<s> I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
<s> I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
<s> Loretta, I can't marry you.
<s> If I marry you my mother will die.
<s> Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
<s> Cosmo's cheating on me.
<s> Well. I don't really know where to start.
<s> No more he's not.
<s> I came right from the airport.
<s> That's incredible.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Johnny...
<s> None of your business.
<s> Will you join me for dinner?
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> I'm too old for you.
<s> You mean the whole house?
<s> I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
<s> What? What?
<s> She looks like one. Yes, she does.
<s> So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
<s> ...What?
<s> The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
<s> The Britons.
<s> The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
<s> Who are they?
<s> NI!   NI!
<s> No, no ... not "is"!
<s> Had enough ... ?
<s> 'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
<s> I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
<s> No.  No.  No!
<s> Just keep me covered.
<s> Oh, just some friends!
<s> Greetings King Arthur.
<s> I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
<s> What?
<s> It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
<s> I'm thirty-seven.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I see.
<s> Course it's a good idea.
<s> When's your next round?
<s> I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
<s> Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
<s> Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
<s> Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
<s> But, Mother ...
<s> I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
<s> ... and you'll come and get him.
<s> What?
<s> We're coming with you.
<s> Oh, I see,  Right.
<s> The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
<s> Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
<s> Why?
<s> No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
<s> Ector.
<s> Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
<s> Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
<s> I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
<s> Seventy a year.
<s> Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
<s> I've got my duties to attend to.
<s> Louder, girl!
<s> Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
<s> Quite.
<s> She's busy.
<s> Out of my way!
<s> I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
<s> And that is my last word on the matter.
<s> How will I know what she requires?
<s> Aye, do.
<s> She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
<s> I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
<s> In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
<s> Quite.
<s> I'm not married.
<s> Maybe, once.
<s> Aye.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
<s> Aye, ma'am.
<s> What?
<s> Are they worth reading?
<s> That doesn't make him an expert.
<s> Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
<s> What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
<s> I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
<s> I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
<s> Yes, ma'am?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
<s> For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
<s> I hope he got his mother's permission.
<s> You can't know that for sure.
<s> Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
<s> I understand he was in a fight.
<s> What is it?
<s> Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
<s> He is sick, ma'am.
<s> Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
<s> It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
<s> And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
<s> Did you play ARCADE last night?
<s> But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
<s> It's twelve-thirty!
<s> I'm in the middle of it...
<s> No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
<s> You imagined it.
<s> Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
<s> Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
<s> She thought Benz was at school.
<s> It's already out.
<s> Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
<s> Everything.
<s> Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
<s> There never is.
<s> I know.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> Yes...but...how did you...
<s> In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
<s> I'm going home. I'll call you later.
<s> You're broke!
<s> Yeah.
<s> How's that?
<s> The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
<s> Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
<s> Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
<s> Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Interesting.
<s> Yeah, I'd say that's it.
<s> You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
<s> Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
<s> Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
<s> We drown.
<s> This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
<s> You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
<s> Okay.
<s> Let's go.
<s> It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
<s> That's a shame.
<s> Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
<s> Because of my charming personality ?
<s> Not quite....
<s> Don't have to tell me twice.
<s> I said NO.
<s> You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
<s> Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
<s> Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
<s> That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
<s> So ?
<s> He probably has a history of this shit.
<s> I am thirty two.
<s> Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
<s> Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
<s> I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
<s> What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
<s> Then what do you want ?
<s> No I am not.
<s> We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
<s> What ?????
<s> I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
<s> Thank you.
<s> If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
<s> Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
<s> I just need to sit and think for a second.
<s> "How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
<s> What ?
<s> Where are we ?
<s> Who was that guy anyway ?
<s> Great.
<s> Was it a nice funeral?
<s> Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
<s> I love you too sweetie, bye.
<s> Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
<s> Maybe he's hungry.
<s> I'd like to, thanks.
<s> Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
<s> 
<s> Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
<s> Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
<s> It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
<s> If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
<s> No THANKS!
<s> Oh my gosh, here it is!
<s> He is one of the great poets.
<s> And I thought I was weird.
<s> ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
<s> Give it to me!
<s> Owh...
<s> What do you think?
<s> But we wouldn't really be related right?
<s> Some sacrifices are worth it.
<s> For the mini-bike fund.
<s> Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
<s> They're great.
<s> Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
<s> How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
<s> Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
<s> Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
<s> No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
<s> Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
<s> All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
<s> Oh, sure okay.
<s> When did you umm, I mean umm...
<s> Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
<s> I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
<s> This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
<s> But what about you and the baby? You need me.
<s> This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
<s> Good for you baby.
<s> No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
<s> Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
<s> Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> What Hurts Vada?
<s> Deceased.
<s> Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
<s> Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
<s> This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
<s> Oh that, she just likes to play.
<s> What's that?
<s> Did she ever see Vada?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
<s> Okay.
<s> I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
<s> You never cared before.
<s> Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
<s> That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
<s> Will you tell her I came by?
<s> Thank you. Bye.
<s> Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
<s> He likes her.
<s> Chocolate?
<s> I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
<s> Well you don't know that. Ask him.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Come here, sit down.
<s> This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
<s> Yes!!
<s> They're just fun to read.
<s> Hi Mr. Bixler!
<s> It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> Hey, we can become blood brothers.
<s> A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
<s> That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't DO that!!
<s> But then I won't be able to see anything.
<s> Umm, Ummmmm
<s> I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
<s> Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
<s> I can see why.
<s> I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
<s> You've been working on this, huh?
<s> And you believe that.
<s> Impressive.
<s> Major.  Dish.
<s> Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
<s> ... you hate weddings, you never go.
<s> ... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
<s> ... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
<s> ... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
<s> Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
<s> ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
<s> Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
<s> ... whatever is manly and independent.
<s> I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
<s> But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
<s> W...
<s> Hate that.
<s> First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
<s> I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
<s> Well.
<s> Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
<s> The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
<s> Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Well, it happens.
<s> That's little egotistical.
<s> ... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
<s> ... and you knew about this.
<s> Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
<s> Well, if that's the way you f...
<s> With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
<s> You got a real good memory, Star.
<s> I won first prize.
<s> Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
<s> How did you come in here?
<s> Thank you-- Yes, I am.
<s> Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
<s> He knows better.
<s> Who the hell is he?
<s> To the bathroom.
<s> She's in Paris.
<s> I'll just be in here.
<s> Harvard?
<s> Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
<s> I'm fine. Can I go up?
<s> Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
<s> Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
<s> No.
<s> Sixty-three.
<s> I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
<s> Next you'll be sick.
<s> Does their hair fall out?
<s> Bye.
<s> End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
<s> Oh.
<s> That's what you said before.
<s> Fifteen minutes?
<s> What...?  0h, yes.
<s> What?
<s> Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
<s> Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
<s> Hello.
<s> Out.
<s> Did it break?
<s> He ain't really new.
<s> Who?
<s> Yes, they were.
<s> Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
<s> I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
<s> Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
<s> Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
<s> You been followin' the news coverage?
<s> Susanville, Soledade.
<s> Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
<s> Ain't love grand.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Ready.
<s> I'm keen with anticipation.
<s> What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
<s> Okay, let's cut it.
<s> Yes.
<s> No fuckin' way!
<s> Yes.
<s> Survival of the fittest.
<s> Where do the air ducts lead?
<s> This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
<s> I hear ya. Play.
<s> They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
<s> Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
<s> Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
<s> Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
<s> Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
<s> One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
<s> I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
<s> Don't call my men assholes.
<s> They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
<s> See Duff. He's the money man.
<s> Guess I don't.
<s> Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
<s> Like hell they wouldn't.
<s> Went to college, huh?
<s> No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
<s> Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
<s> I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
<s> Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
<s> 'Been up north?
<s> Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
<s> She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
<s> It'll be fine when we get done with it.
<s> I keep thinking about him.
<s> Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
<s> I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
<s> There's nothing to say.
<s> Why don't you relax, Frankie?
<s> Yeah, see you in hell.
<s> Plannin' on getting married?
<s> I heard you.
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay.
<s> Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
<s> Yeah, sure. Good luck.
<s> I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
<s> I guess I ain't.
<s> Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
<s> You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
<s> Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
<s> Anything you say, baby.
<s> You hate Raoul?
<s> Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
<s> Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
<s> I'm still on my honeymoon.
<s> Of course.
<s> She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
<s> Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
<s> A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
<s> I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
<s> I've arranged for him to work with us.
<s> Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
<s> Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
<s> I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
<s> I find out now.
<s> I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
<s> Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
<s> I don't have a girl.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fine, Dixie. Fine.
<s> That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
<s> Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
<s> Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
<s> No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
<s> We run. You crack the pattern?
<s> It's coming.
<s> I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
<s> And Linda...
<s> Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
<s> I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
<s> Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
<s> I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Almost two days.
<s> We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
<s> If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
<s> A regular Fagan.
<s> Give me five minutes.
<s> Something exotic I hope.
<s> I know you have. C'mere.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Yeah. Let's do that.
<s> Petty good.
<s> College?
<s> What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
<s> Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
<s> Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
<s> No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
<s> At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
<s> Just get in the van, Josie.
<s> Hidden camera.
<s> Sometimes opposites attract.
<s> A flack jacket.
<s> Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
<s> Oh. Right.
<s> No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
<s> There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
<s> You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
<s> I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
<s> Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
<s> You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
<s> Do you remember high school?
<s> I can't do this.
<s> Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
<s> Sorry. Forgetful.
<s> Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
<s> Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
<s> I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
<s> You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
<s> Wow. You believe in me that much--
<s> I just can't look at you the same way.
<s> You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
<s> Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
<s> Maybe we should sit.
<s> Lock.
<s> <i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<s> We can handle it.
<s> Where?
<s> But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
<s> No.
<s> <i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
<s> Oh, please...
<s> Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
<s> Where's Jesse?
<s> Only the wet ones.
<s> You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
<s> Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
<s> Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
<s> I know.
<s> I don't know.  Where are we going?
<s> There's nothing to figure out.
<s> I can't!
<s> No.  I'm okay.
<s> First door up the stairs.
<s> It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
<s> No, she's right.
<s> No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
<s> I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
<s> I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
<s> Those are ancient history.
<s> I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
<s> It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
<s> That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
<s> You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
<s> Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
<s> Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
<s> You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
<s> I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
<s> For what?
<s> Everybody take five.
<s> Anything?
<s> There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
<s> Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
<s> No.  We're alone.
<s> A sad choice.
<s> The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
<s> Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
<s> Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
<s> Yeah?  What did we ever do?
<s> Me too.
<s> Fifteen million dollars.
<s> Here, let me help.
<s> No.
<s> You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
<s> I thought you were leaving.
<s> Let's go in.
<s> This is the place.
<s> Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
<s> Well, get a message through to him too.
<s> What do you think?
<s> The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
<s> No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
<s> Hello.
<s> Tempting but... no, thank you.
<s> The movie star?
<s> In a depressingly asexual way.
<s> Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
<s> It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
<s> Blimey.  What's that?
<s> The others?
<s> This is Henry James film?
<s> Ah... yes, enormously.
<s> Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
<s> Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
<s> Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
<s> Definitely no comment.
<s> I think you do, yes.
<s> No -- did you?
<s> No, don't think I do.
<s> Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
<s> Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
<s> You're welcome.  Did you find them?
<s> Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
<s> I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
<s> Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
<s> Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
<s> Three.
<s> Y-y-y-yes...
<s> I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
<s> Will you come with me, please.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
<s> Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
<s> What for?
<s> Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
<s> He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
<s> Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
<s> O-o-o-oh...
<s> 'K-k-kay, Mack!
<s> Wh-wh-wh-wh...
<s> W-W-Where we g-g-going?
<s> God Bless America.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Are they all crazies?
<s> It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
<s> Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
<s> Atta boy, Cheswick!
<s> Yeah, Mack, what is it?
<s> Huh?
<s> So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
<s> Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
<s> My feet hurt...
<s> I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
<s> Lobotomy?
<s> You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
<s> What for?
<s> I just started!
<s> McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
<s> Me, too! Me, too!
<s> Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
<s> In what way?
<s> I see...
<s> Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
<s> Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
<s> I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
<s> I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
<s> You're on!
<s> Okay. Who else?
<s> Okay. How you doing?
<s> You an' me, Chief.
<s> How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
<s> Oh...
<s> Thank you, ma'am,
<s> Yes, Miss Ratched!
<s> Evenin', ma'am.
<s> Is he one of the loonies?
<s> You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
<s> It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
<s> I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
<s> Your great aunt.
<s> Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
<s> Hm.
<s> Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
<s> If it's any of your business, yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Right now?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
<s> Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
<s> No.  I just came by to apologize.
<s> Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
<s> I can't believe you did that!
<s> I brought you that, too.
<s> And more...
<s> Yes you did.
<s> My God, you have...
<s> You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
<s> Maybe.
<s> "Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
<s> What?
<s> So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
<s> We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
<s> Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
<s> What?
<s> I meant about my idea.
<s> Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
<s> The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
<s> You sure you'll be okay?
<s> Is Damon Bradley here?
<s> Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
<s> When you could've found one in America.
<s> He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
<s> Kate.
<s> A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
<s> Oh.
<s> It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
<s> We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
<s> Went to high school with him. But...
<s> It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
<s> He missed me.
<s> That's really romantic.
<s> He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
<s> What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
<s> I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
<s> So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
<s> Gimme.
<s> This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
<s> It's a living.
<s> I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
<s> Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
<s> Don't say that!
<s> I could have been better!
<s> I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
<s> Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
<s> You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
<s> Give it to me my Pop's job
<s> Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
<s> Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
<s> How would you've done it?
<s> What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
<s> I am?
<s> How about another one?
<s> I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
<s> I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
<s> I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
<s> Terry...?
<s> Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
<s> What do you want from me, Father.
<s> You go to hell.
<s> Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
<s> Are you on the level, Father?
<s> If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
<s> What?
<s> You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
<s> Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
<s> Not a dent.  Perfect
<s> Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
<s> You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
<s> Now just a minute, I
<s> Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
<s> Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
<s> One of these days.
<s> ..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
<s> Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
<s> Okay.
<s> You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
<s> Don't let them hear you.
<s> I'm afraid I'll faint.
<s> Yes I feel it in my bones.
<s> There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
<s> Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
<s> Is there time?
<s> Yes, Master.
<s> I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
<s> Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
<s> So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
<s> Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
<s> You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
<s> From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
<s> They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
<s> You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
<s> Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
<s> Oh.  Uh-huh.
<s> Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
<s> That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
<s> Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
<s> We'll leave first thing in the morning.
<s> Just hung up.
<s> Forty-five minutes.
<s> Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
<s> Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
<s> I saw Karen Sisco.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
<s> In the trunk, yeah?
<s> Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
<s> You have to know what you're talking about.
<s> Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
<s> They're in 7D.
<s> Call and tell you.
<s> Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> There a problem, Foley?
<s> I don't smoke.
<s> Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
<s> That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
<s> Not until recently.
<s> A little.
<s> Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
<s> Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
<s> Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
<s> It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
<s> You have to be kidding.
<s> Really.
<s> Yes.
<s> Really.  He has a cop's face.
<s> Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
<s> I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
<s> No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
<s> Yeah, but in a nice way.
<s> Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
<s> My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
<s> Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
<s> That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
<s> Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
<s> The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
<s> It works.  You should try it sometime.
<s> What's to think about?
<s> First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
<s> How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
<s> A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
<s> I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
<s> I'm not leaving Midge.
<s> If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
<s> Yeah.  That was the ninth.
<s> What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
<s> I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
<s> Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
<s> You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
<s> You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
<s> I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
<s> Oh...
<s> Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You a lawyer?
<s> Off a tip?
<s> I told you, he isn't here.
<s> You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
<s> If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
<s> Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
<s> Sir, I --
<s> They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
<s> You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
<s> Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
<s> I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
<s> It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
<s> Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
<s> We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
<s> You were more like brothers.
<s> Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
<s> We can explain, Colonel.
<s> Yes'm.
<s> The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
<s> But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
<s> How did you?...
<s> I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
<s> It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
<s> They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
<s> It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
<s> Have the planes made it to China?
<s> And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
<s> Crank her!
<s> It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
<s> Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
<s> We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
<s> Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
<s> Were taking you back to the nurse.
<s> Yes. Let's stay in touch.
<s> That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
<s> What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
<s> Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
<s> That's disgusting!
<s> I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
<s> I'm not going.
<s> Rejected, worthless, miserable.
<s> Good.
<s> Is this slow enough for you?
<s> Nothing.. Selling is selling.
<s> I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
<s> And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
<s> I just can't trust you anymore.
<s> It opens, too. Look inside.
<s> Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
<s> Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
<s> Touchy, touchy!
<s> But I'm remembering the future.
<s> I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
<s> They care about you. They're just a different generation.
<s> I can't do that.
<s> Can we split now?
<s> What?
<s> It's not Charlie. It's me.
<s> At my age? Don't be silly.
<s> Doing some shopping?
<s> This morning was good.
<s> You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
<s> This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
<s> Of course, dear. You're home now.
<s> Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
<s> Rosalie Testa!
<s> You have an incredible memory.
<s> What was?
<s> You're a sweet man, Richard.
<s> It really wasn't that difficult.
<s> I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
<s> I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
<s> When do we start?
<s> Come on. You can't be serious.
<s> Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
<s> Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
<s> No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
<s> Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
<s> No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
<s> Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
<s> I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
<s> There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
<s> Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
<s> Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
<s> "Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
<s> He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
<s> Is he gonna be okay?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
<s> Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
<s> Sorry...
<s> What's that on your forehead, pal?
<s> So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
<s> I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
<s> That's not what I said.
<s> Don't do this, Andy.
<s> I'm seeing him this afternoon.
<s> It's okay. Can I sit down?
<s> Little baby girl.
<s> Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
<s> Fine.
<s> What?
<s> I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
<s> Not bad.
<s> Correct.
<s> Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
<s> I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
<s> What impressed you about him?
<s> It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
<s> I suppose you could say that.
<s> No. I didn't.
<s> I'm an excellent lawyer.
<s> You bet. We'll see you later.
<s> I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
<s> You could have infected him, isn't that right?
<s> That's right.
<s> Answer the question, please.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
<s> Right.
<s> Wyant Wheeler represented us.
<s> What kind of people?
<s> Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
<s> Give me the camera, Joe.
<s> Fine, Joe.
<s> Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
<s> Night, honey.
<s> Any women on board?
<s> Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
<s> Andy, you don't want this.
<s> ... It's time to get this society back on track!
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
<s> Entered our minds.
<s> Had it with deals.
<s> You sure you can keep --
<s> Riddick? How close?
<s> Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<s> You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
<s> No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
<s> Possibly.
<s> Hey, who?
<s> Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
<s> Let's just be sure.
<s> Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
<s> What the hell's it matter?
<s> 79 kilos.
<s> Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
<s> Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
<s> 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
<s> For now.
<s> And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
<s> Please...this solves nothing...please....
<s> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<s> Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
<s> If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
<s> Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
<s> Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
<s> Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
<s> What, it's broken?
<s> We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
<s> To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
<s> That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
<s> Good luck then.
<s> What's so special about him?
<s> Remembers what?
<s> Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
<s> It's probably wrong --
<s> That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
<s> Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
<s> Zira....
<s> Yo!
<s> Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
<s> You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
<s> Sustained.
<s> I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
<s> Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
<s> Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
<s> What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
<s> But I'm not prepared to die.
<s> I think you're making a mistake.
<s> He wouldn't leave her.
<s> A man, Dr. Maximus.
<s> Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
<s> Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
<s> Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
<s> Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
<s> Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
<s> Cease fire! Withdraw!
<s> Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
<s> Listen, listen -- I can speak --
<s> Which one?
<s> Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
<s> Maybe not.
<s> In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
<s> I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
<s> Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
<s> Fuck you bitch.
<s> Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
<s> Shaddup bitch.
<s> Youse so fucked up man.
<s> Where's Elias come from?
<s> You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
<s> I volunteered.
<s> Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
<s> Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
<s> Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
<s> You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
<s> Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
<s> Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
<s> Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
<s> He dugged his own grave.
<s> Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
<s> Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
<s> This is one time we could sure use Elias.
<s> My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Maybe you're going to have to like me.
<s> How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
<s> I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
<s> You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
<s> You don't know who he is?
<s> So have I.
<s> No percentage in that.
<s> They'll look for you.
<s> And Betty Mayfield--
<s> Wonder what?
<s> Including Killaine.
<s> I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
<s> So that I will never be found.
<s> I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
<s> And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
<s> But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
<s> I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
<s> A graduation present.
<s> We wouldn't have met at all.
<s> Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
<s> I know that.
<s> For two hundred?
<s> A private joke.
<s> Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
<s> I never notice the view after the first week.
<s> I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
<s> They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
<s> Let me know when you've identified him
<s> I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
<s> So it seems Sergeant.
<s> So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
<s> Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
<s> Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
<s> It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
<s> That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
<s> I'm interested in who handled it.
<s> Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
<s> Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
<s> You don't have to make a pose of it.
<s> What does it look like?
<s> Years, why?
<s> I say YES!
<s> Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
<s> It's fine, thank you.
<s> To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
<s> We'll see you next week, and if--
<s> Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
<s> Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
<s> I see.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
<s> Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
<s> I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
<s> I think it went on rather too long.
<s> You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
<s> Both dead.
<s> Very thoughtful.
<s> Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
<s> Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
<s> Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
<s> One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
<s> It's shit.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> Hello.
<s> Suez.  1956.
<s> Take a look at these.
<s> Next time tell her I've gone away.
<s> We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
<s> Promise?
<s> Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
<s> Not yet.
<s> The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
<s> No, Bells Beach, Australia.
<s> So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
<s> Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
<s> Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
<s> I say when it's over!
<s> Caught my first tube this morning.
<s> That's the point, isn't it?
<s> Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
<s> Got it...
<s> Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
<s> No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
<s> Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
<s> Nothing.
<s> No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
<s> I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
<s> Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
<s> Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
<s> No more games.
<s> This isn't your style, Dillon.
<s> ... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
<s> Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
<s> Thank you, Sergeant.
<s> What's that, General?
<s> There's no sign of it.
<s> No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
<s> You're not getting any navy contracts.
<s> Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
<s> No.
<s> Who indeed...
<s> To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
<s> You've got a lot of nerve.
<s> <u>Expected</u>... offer.
<s> I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
<s> Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
<s> If you can figure it out, be my guest.
<s> What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
<s> Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
<s> Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
<s> Diet coke.
<s> Mmm, I could tell.
<s> I'd say you give a good dollar value.
<s> Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
<s> No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
<s> I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
<s> Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
<s> I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
<s> He died a long time ago.
<s> Ready to stomp sod?
<s> Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
<s> I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
<s> Vivian...
<s> You won't.
<s> Where are you taking me!?
<s> Huh?
<s> I more than liked it.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
<s> It was good.
<s> You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
<s> Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
<s> But, Edward...
<s> Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
<s> I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
<s> That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
<s> Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
<s> Dummy.
<s> Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
<s> Okay.
<s> I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
<s> But I always eat like this.
<s> Professionally?
<s> I don't think it would fit you.
<s> I just might do that.
<s> I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
<s> I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
<s> Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
<s> Gently.
<s> You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
<s> Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
<s> Veer left. Left. Left!
<s> Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
<s> Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
<s> Yes, some of the time. 
<s> I have a little.
<s> What is it?
<s> The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
<s> Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
<s> All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
<s> I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
<s> Light him.
<s> I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
<s> He's already dead.
<s> Are you a rotten liar.
<s> No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
<s> Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
<s> And what is that?
<s> No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
<s> You know what a hurry we're in.
<s> Oh, have it your way.
<s> For the Princess?
<s> It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
<s> Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
<s> Have fun storming the castle.
<s> A little bit.
<s> Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
<s> "To my honey I'll croon,
<s> "Keep a shining in...
<s> Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
<s> Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
<s> Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
<s> You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
<s> You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
<s> I already have.  Come on.
<s> Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
<s> Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
<s> Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
<s> Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
<s> Yes.
<s> With whom?
<s> Really, I never dreamed ...
<s> We swear it!
<s> It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
<s> I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
<s> You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
<s> Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
<s> Nice girl.
<s> The Blue Max...
<s> "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
<s> No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
<s> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
<s> No.
<s> How do you know she didn't make a call?
<s> If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
<s> Money.
<s> Can I trade in my car and take another?
<s> Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
<s> Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
<s> A lot?
<s> Lila.
<s> To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
<s> What do you know about it?
<s> Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
<s> She'll need both of us.
<s> I'm glad we didn't.
<s> Sam!
<s> It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
<s> You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
<s> I have to go, Sam.
<s> I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
<s> It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
<s> What are you running away from?
<s> Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
<s> Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
<s> Norman.
<s> I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
<s> Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
<s> I suppose you want a cabin.
<s> Haven't any.
<s> Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
<s> Fine.
<s> I don't know what you've been saying.
<s> Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
<s> Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
<s> This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
<s> Did I?
<s> Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
<s> Who are you? What is your name?
<s> Maybe you want my money, too.
<s> Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
<s> Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
<s> You found Buckley?
<s> Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
<s> Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
<s> He isn't here.
<s> I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
<s> I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
<s> I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
<s> Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
<s> Well, I do say it.
<s> I'd call it stupid at any time.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
<s> Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
<s> No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
<s> All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
<s> Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
<s> We'll grant that.
<s> You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
<s> Where were you going when you got in that cab?
<s> No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
<s> No foolin' -- any suspect?
<s> There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
<s> Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
<s> My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
<s> Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
<s> Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
<s> I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
<s> Heaven knows. A lot.
<s> Don't ask any questions. Come on!
<s> I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
<s> And you think I will permit this, my friend?
<s> You're insane.
<s> Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
<s> Day or night?
<s> I could go out of town.
<s> At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
<s> That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
<s> A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
<s> Is Rose here?
<s> Where is she?
<s> But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
<s> This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
<s> You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
<s> No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
<s> There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
<s> Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
<s> I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
<s> You won't die, Rose.
<s> Five hundred rabbits?
<s> How did the rabbits kill him?
<s> Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
<s> All right, what do you know?
<s> I don't know.
<s> But how would you find him?
<s> Well... maybe...
<s> Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
<s> She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
<s> It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
<s> Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
<s> Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
<s> Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
<s> First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
<s> I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
<s> No reason at all, darlin'.
<s> I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
<s> Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
<s> They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
<s> Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
<s> That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
<s> Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
<s> Fine.
<s> I... I'll get the grits.
<s> Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
<s> No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
<s> Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
<s> Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
<s> If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
<s> My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
<s> Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
<s> You mean a farm?
<s> It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
<s> She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
<s> What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
<s> Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
<s> You can stop it right now.
<s> Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
<s> Well, I am working on my thesis.
<s> I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
<s> I don't mind.
<s> Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
<s> Thank you, concerned citizen.
<s> I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
<s> Stop blaming yourself.
<s> It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
<s> Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
<s> Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
<s> We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
<s> Feeling great.
<s> Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
<s> Wha... ?
<s> It's go time, Billy-B.
<s> We have to find Kittle.
<s> ... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
<s> You can't be serious.
<s> I... I think I can... clarify...
<s> I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
<s> Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
<s> You know... you could say thank you.
<s> Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
<s> I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
<s> Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
<s> He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
<s> I know it is, even if you don't.
<s> Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
<s> Out here.  On your knees.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
<s> See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
<s> I'm well aware of that.
<s> So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
<s> Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
<s> You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
<s> I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
<s> She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
<s> I can't see.
<s> Luke!
<s> Hi, Han... Chewie.
<s> Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
<s> It'll work. It'll work.
<s> All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
<s> No, wait! I thought you were blind!
<s> All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
<s> All right, hang on.
<s> It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
<s> I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
<s> You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
<s> We shall double our efforts.
<s> Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
<s> But, why must you confront him?
<s> I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
<s> There is no conflict.
<s> Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
<s> I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
<s> Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
<s> And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
<s> Rocky!
<s> Made me give you the eye And then panic,
<s> I've got something to say.
<s> And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
<s> Yes.
<s> Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
<s> Oh no no no no.
<s> They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
<s> ...I'm sorry.
<s> ...Goodnight, Rocky.
<s> Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
<s> My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
<s> I don't think you're a bum.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
<s> Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
<s> They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
<s> Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
<s> You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
<s> Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
<s> Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
<s> I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
<s> ...Still don't feel no heat.
<s> Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
<s> ...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
<s> ...Ten minutes.
<s> That's it, I'm broke.
<s> I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
<s> I'm gonna do somethin with it.
<s> Black market?
<s> No -- Just me.
<s> I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
<s> I like yella teeth.
<s> Why?
<s> C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
<s> What?
<s> Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
<s> Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
<s> ...No.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Freak luck for sure.
<s> Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
<s> I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
<s> Damn! How's it look?
<s> Great, kid, great.
<s> He ain't losin' nothin'.
<s> Let's get outta this stink.
<s> Maybe ya should see a doctor.
<s> Maybe another job is the best thing.
<s> Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
<s> Maybe ya better forget it.
<s> Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
<s> Keep this job, ya eat better.
<s> Whatta you think?
<s> What?
<s> I dunno -- she fills gaps.
<s> Whatta these guys want?
<s> Apollo's a great fighter.
<s> Feel? I dunno... Happy.
<s> Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
<s> Shoulda guessed.
<s> You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
<s> Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
<s> I'll bet.
<s> Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
<s> So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
<s> They?
<s> Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
<s> That's because I don't have a doorbell.
<s> You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
<s> If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
<s> Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
<s> That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
<s> He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
<s> No, I don't.
<s> Aah!
<s> I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
<s> Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
<s> Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
<s> Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
<s> Just because you got 'em to laugh?
<s> A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
<s> If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
<s> No, it's not.
<s> Then I'll leave thee.
<s> Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
<s> Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
<s> Good-morrow, cousin.
<s> But new struck cuz.
<s> Of love?
<s> At thy good heart's oppression.
<s> In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
<s> Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
<s> Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
<s> No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
<s> Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
<s> 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
<s> Ahhh!
<s> Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
<s> With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
<s> Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
<s> Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
<s> In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
<s> Right.
<s> Could you not take some occasion without giving?
<s> To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
<s> Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
<s> When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
<s> And who are you?
<s> Which leads us to...
<s> I thought I did.
<s> They're good!
<s> Duty calls?
<s> Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
<s> You sure about this?
<s> But would you stake your life, that's the question...
<s> I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
<s> I think not.  After you...
<s> Bad company...
<s> You'll die if you leave here.
<s> I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
<s> How did you know?
<s> Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
<s> Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
<s> Did he bring that with him?
<s> Eat shit and die slowly...
<s> Coordinate what?
<s> As in, they own it?
<s> I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
<s> Like Larry or Swede.
<s> So is the woman.
<s> Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
<s> I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
<s> Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> You see the bullet?
<s> Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
<s> Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
<s> I think not.
<s> Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
<s> Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
<s> Closest and oldest.
<s> What?
<s> You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
<s> Gone.  Destroyed.
<s> I might know where you could get a copy.
<s> I get the picture.
<s> None of them had any --
<s> Never heard of it.
<s> What do you mean what are we going to do?
<s> Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
<s> All right we will.
<s> What are you gonna do?
<s> He saw everything!
<s> I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
<s> That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
<s> We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
<s> Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
<s> What are you thinking?
<s> Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
<s> He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
<s> Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
<s> Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
<s> There it is...now what about the others?
<s> Then we're screwed.
<s> No.  Why?
<s> Has he?
<s> I love you too.
<s> Nothing happened?
<s> Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
<s> I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
<s> Well I was just throwing out ideas...
<s> I don't know.  My friends...
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
<s> Could it have been this?
<s> You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
<s> What?
<s> Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
<s> Hi.
<s> Take it or leave it.
<s> Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
<s> What?
<s> Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
<s> Yeah let's hear about your day.
<s> Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
<s> Calm down --
<s> And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
<s> So I want the money and I want it now.
<s> Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
<s> Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
<s> Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
<s> There was more than that.
<s> So...what's the good news?
<s> We're going to find out.
<s> And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
<s> I'd like to see you try.
<s> You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
<s> One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
<s> El Capitan?
<s> Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
<s> So what's your story?
<s> It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
<s> In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
<s> What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
<s> Lee, you okay?
<s> Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
<s> No.
<s> Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
<s> How you doin'?
<s> She said I could pick any girl I want.
<s> Don't look at my ass!
<s> Detective Yu?  Never met him.
<s> I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
<s> Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
<s> No.  She's a school teacher.
<s> How the hell did Tan get away with it?
<s> I cannot go to LA...
<s> Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
<s> You pull a muscle or something?
<s> I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
<s> Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
<s> What is it?
<s> It's your turn!
<s> I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
<s> Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
<s> It's okay, I got lots more.
<s> Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
<s> No.  But I'll help you.
<s> Baby Duck?
<s> Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
<s> Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
<s> In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
<s> I know, but --
<s> Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
<s> I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
<s> I know a shortcut.
<s> What plate?
<s> Did you make the plate?!
<s> Yes, I think so.
<s> I am from outa town.
<s> I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
<s> It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
<s> Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
<s> It's called a dress.
<s> That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
<s> At this point we don't have much.
<s> That's what you were supposed to be!
<s> I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
<s> I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
<s> Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
<s> Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
<s> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
<s> Maintain eye contact.
<s> What did he ask?
<s> Good one!  Thanks.
<s> Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
<s> Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
<s> It's hurting.
<s> What?
<s> But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
<s> Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
<s> The real story on Miss Carpenter.
<s> Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
<s> Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
<s> Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
<s> It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
<s> No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
<s> Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
<s> Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
<s> Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
<s> He is not!
<s> Cindy the manicurist.
<s> You afraid to try?
<s> Highly suspect.
<s> Missed me bad, huh?
<s> Yes.
<s> You humiliated me!
<s> I'd rather not.
<s> I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
<s> I love you, too.
<s> They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
<s> "I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
<s> I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
<s> She's the boss.
<s> It's probably because you got him fired.
<s> Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
<s> He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
<s> No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
<s> You don't love me, is that it?
<s> -- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
<s> Happy New Year.
<s> That doesn't make any sense.
<s> So what happened?
<s> At the top of the Empire State Building --
<s> Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
<s> About what?
<s> Actually, he sounded nice.
<s> "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
<s> Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
<s> You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
<s> That's impossible.  A guy can't --
<s> I always wondered about that too.
<s> That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
<s> Becky?
<s> Good night.
<s> That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
<s> A sense of humor.
<s> That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
<s> This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
<s> How am I going to explain this to Walter?
<s> Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
<s> Any time.
<s> Sure you do --
<s> Hello.
<s> I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
<s> I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
<s> What's she talking about?
<s> I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
<s> Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
<s> Right, right.
<s> You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
<s> I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
<s> You think so?
<s> What is it?
<s> My feelings exactly.
<s> I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
<s> Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
<s> They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
<s> I know.
<s> I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
<s> Now I'm late.  Bye.
<s> There she is.
<s> It was all they had.
<s> Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
<s> What about it?
<s> I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
<s> You look good yourself.
<s> You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
<s> He's good at it.
<s> I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
<s> You want 'em all arrested?
<s> So? What does he want to do about 'em?
<s> You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
<s> Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
<s> Yes. We will light the candles.
<s> Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
<s> With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
<s> All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
<s> Never... never... never!
<s> She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
<s> Can be what?
<s> No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
<s> And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
<s> Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
<s> Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
<s> I thought maybe you forgot...
<s> It's Mama's Saint's Day.
<s> Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
<s> You should have helped her without being asked.
<s> Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
<s> Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
<s> Did you see his hair color?
<s> First rate, ain't it?
<s> I understand. Thanks anyway.
<s> Nothing.
<s> And you admire that?
<s> I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
<s> I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
<s> You don't say.
<s> Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
<s> Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
<s> Can you set that up?
<s> John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
<s> Good for you Jimmy.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> No, I'm good.
<s> But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
<s> Hey, I was just trying to ...
<s> Pull your motherfucking pants down.
<s> Big Bill
<s> I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
<s> Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
<s> I'll keep that in mind.
<s> Just some buddies.
<s> Question is, what are you doing here?
<s> I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
<s> Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
<s> Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
<s> Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
<s> Several possession charges, but nothing major.
<s> You mean the menacing red car?
<s> Thank you.  Thank you very much.
<s> I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
<s> Just admit you're wrong.
<s> Where are your men now?
<s> He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
<s> Spit it out, Captain.
<s> Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
<s> Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
<s> You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
<s> Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
<s> Keep trying.
<s> White-walls?
<s> FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
<s> You know classical music?
<s> Where are you from, Captain?
<s> Those guns are close.
<s> You tryin' to get yourself killed?
<s> I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
<s> We in radio contact with anybody up there?
<s> Hell of a mission.
<s> That's not what we're here for.
<s> About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
<s> Bits and pieces.
<s> Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
<s> I think you're right, Keith.
<s> I know.
<s> Out of the mouth of babes.
<s> Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
<s> There's always a bright side.
<s> Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
<s> I don't like that one.
<s> That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
<s> Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
<s> Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
<s> We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
<s> I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
<s> He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
<s> So you refuse to answer my questions?
<s> Good for her.
<s> Excellent.
<s> See you tomorrow.
<s> You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
<s> He wants to leave things on a good note.
<s> And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
<s> Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
<s> Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
<s> Okay.
<s> I love you dad.
<s> No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
<s> Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
<s> Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
<s> But I found the money.
<s> Hi.
<s> If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
<s> Hi.  You called me?
<s> Yeah.  What a day.
<s> Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
<s> Would you hold this for me?
<s> They knew of you.  Now they know you.
<s> That's cool then.
<s> Come on.
<s> Right.
<s> Okay.  It's good knowing this.
<s> Lloyd, I love you, okay?
<s> I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
<s> So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
<s> You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
<s> Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
<s> No way.
<s> Yeah.
<s> How you doin', brother?
<s> You know Diane Court?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Alright!
<s> A charade?  How could it be a charade?
<s> We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
<s> It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
<s> Of course I'm on it.
<s> You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
<s> There's nothing in the stores.
<s> How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
<s> I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
<s> I need a drink.
<s> He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
<s> The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
<s> Something they can hold in their hands.
<s> The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
<s> More.
<s> Stern.
<s> You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
<s> No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
<s> The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Where is everybody?
<s> Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
<s> I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
<s> Home--where he lives.
<s> Enter Cotton Weary.
<s> Sid, you don't have to.
<s> I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
<s> I think it's out of your control.
<s> But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
<s> I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
<s> What guy?
<s> I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
<s> Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
<s> Just for you, Sid.
<s> Tuitions expensive.
<s> Meaning?
<s> No, wait here.
<s> There's nothing. I'm coming down.
<s> Dewey, there's no such place.
<s> Whatever.
<s> I'll give you one guess.
<s> Watch your back.
<s> Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
<s> Please, I have the perfect excuse.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
<s> You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
<s> Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
<s> Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
<s> But...
<s> What's your favorite scary movie?
<s> It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
<s> Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
<s> He's after me.
<s> I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
<s> Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
<s> Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
<s> Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
<s> Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
<s> There's more.
<s> But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
<s> Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
<s> What did you know about your mother?
<s> Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
<s> But you know who she was.
<s> Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
<s> GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
<s> Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
<s> Who's this?
<s> This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
<s> And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
<s> SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
<s> I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
<s> Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
<s> W-what do you want?
<s> You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
<s> Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
<s> You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
<s> Oh...
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> She looked dead. Still does.
<s> I'll only stay a sec.
<s> So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> You're making popcorn?
<s> Really? What?
<s> Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
<s> Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> I want to now who I'm talking to.
<s> I told you not to hang up on me.
<s> NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
<s> I believe you...
<s> Guess.
<s> No...
<s> NOOO!
<s> Please go away! Leave us alone!
<s> It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
<s> Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
<s> We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
<s> Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
<s> You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
<s> I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
<s> How is everything?
<s> We haven't located her Dad yet.
<s> Have you contacted the bureau?
<s> Call the police.
<s> It'll be out later this year.
<s> I'll send you a copy.
<s> LEAVEMEALONE!
<s> Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
<s> Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
<s> You got it.
<s> Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
<s> There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
<s> Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
<s> Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
<s> Yeah, okay... whatever.
<s> Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
<s> It's past seven.
<s> If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
<s> And you believe it?
<s> Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
<s> Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
<s> There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
<s> Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
<s> I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
<s> We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
<s> Where was the girl?
<s> Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
<s> Delusions of grandeur.
<s> Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
<s> But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
<s> Can we talk about this in private?
<s> I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
<s> All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
<s> Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
<s> None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
<s> Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
<s> Oh, that's all.
<s> Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
<s> I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
<s> I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
<s> They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
<s> Oh, it's alright.
<s> You got to be kidding.
<s> That is.
<s> You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
<s> Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
<s> We had him.
<s> I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
<s> You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
<s> Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
<s> Kiss me on the lips.
<s> High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
<s> I'm sorry, I only...
<s> You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
<s> Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
<s> I want to have children.  It's just...
<s> Did the wife confess?
<s> You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
<s> What, Ben?
<s> That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
<s> That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
<s> I'm Clayton.
<s> They have done...nothing...They are my people...
<s> I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
<s> Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
<s> Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
<s> You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
<s> Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
<s> Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
<s> No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
<s> What's that?
<s> Think it might be...?
<s> Look?
<s> Not likely.
<s> Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
<s> Not far from it...
<s> I got your boy killed.
<s> No...not yet...
<s> Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
<s> Well I ain't one of 'em!
<s> Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
<s> <U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
<s> Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
<s> It still worked in town.
<s> You?
<s> Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
<s> Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
<s> Yeah... I have to go to town.
<s> Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
<s> Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
<s> I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
<s> We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
<s> And the title of this piece?
<s> He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
<s> My Massacre at Paris is complete.
<s> Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
<s> Twenty pounds on delivery
<s> You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
<s> The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
<s> A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
<s> Ten pounds.
<s> Done.
<s> The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
<s> Yes, I saw it.
<s> By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
<s> And his ears.
<s> A share of the profits.
<s> It is all locked safe in here
<s> Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
<s> Who wrote that?
<s> Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
<s> We are about to embark on a great voyage.
<s> How goes it, Will?
<s> I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
<s> Good title.
<s> Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
<s> The daughter of his enemy.
<s> "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
<s> "Of love?"
<s> Be still.
<s> Verona again.
<s> You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
<s> Your Majesty
<s> I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
<s> "Madam!"
<s> Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
<s> "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
<s> "Ay me."
<s> You have opened the playhouses?
<s> Can you love a player?
<s> No, the morning rooster woke me.
<s> I must. I must
<s> That's my line!
<s> Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
<s> Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
<s> A literary feud. Quite normal.
<s> My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
<s> I was the more deceived.
<s> But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
<s> How does it?
<s> You flatter, my lord.
<s> My hat?
<s> I . . .
<s> Does she say so?
<s> You are on my ground.
<s> I don't know -- Campbell or something?
<s> We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
<s> Can we talk about something?
<s> I want to talk now.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> There was a break-in.
<s> Not eating like you used to, that's what.
<s> Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
<s> That's all?
<s> Well, yes.
<s> Just serve.
<s> Not usually this drunk.
<s> Is that all?
<s> OK.
<s> Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
<s> Who?
<s> Where he can't get it?
<s> Of course.
<s> Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
<s> No, three. Who said there were four?
<s> Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
<s> You paid two hundred pounds for this?
<s> No one.
<s> With a face like this?
<s> Sorry?
<s> Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I'm boring?
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> A priest who dies.
<s> That sounds fine.
<s> Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
<s> The first one was fine.
<s> But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
<s> It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
<s> Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
<s> I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
<s> Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
<s> Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<s> Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
<s> You're looking great, baby.
<s> I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
<s> Nobody can hear it.
<s> No.
<s> Her?
<s> It isn't?
<s> Hello.
<s> Why do you wanna know so bad?
<s> You think that's funny, don't you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right.
<s> Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
<s> Yeah.
<s> -- Yeah... your car down here?
<s> Yeah... wow.
<s> Do you? You still see him?
<s> ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
<s> Did I what?
<s> Hey, I don't tell.
<s> You did, I know you did.
<s> Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
<s> -- we can't now.
<s> Fuckin' A --
<s> -- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
<s> Mmmm --
<s> Look who's talking.
<s> -- well you better go after her.
<s> Please, we'll have to talk later --
<s> Don't go, Jackie...
<s> Wanda...
<s> -- oh -- sweetheart...
<s> -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
<s> That's too bad.
<s> You said somebody... who?
<s> George, I don't --
<s> I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
<s> Okay...  Night, baby.
<s> Great.
<s> Just a second, I'll be right with you...
<s> Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
<s> I didn't want him meeting me here.
<s> Oh, Christ.
<s> Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
<s> How many?
<s> -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
<s> -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
<s> Did you?
<s> Did you?
<s> No?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Oh, hey...
<s> Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
<s> Well, what?
<s> But...
<s> Lester, it just happened.
<s> No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
<s> What?
<s> Steve?
<s> What's that?
<s> I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
<s> See you later.
<s> Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
<s> Don't be silly.
<s> Well, you know what I mean.
<s> Is he an enemy?
<s> -- sort of a boyfriend?
<s> -- no.
<s> Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
<s> Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
<s> I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
<s> Where to, Les?
<s> You mean they ate each other up?
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Do you like this hotel?
<s> I guess so.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Tony.
<s> Do they know he tell you things?
<s> Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
<s> You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
<s> Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
<s> Yes?
<s> Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
<s> Okay, Mom.
<s> Are you having a bad dream?
<s> Oh!
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
<s> Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
<s> Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
<s> And, er... where are they now?
<s> He is, Mr. Torrance.
<s> A nigger.
<s> Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
<s> Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
<s> I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
<s> Good.
<s> Good evening Mr. Torrance.
<s> Uh...huh.
<s> Stop swinging the bat.
<s> Wendy give me the bat.
<s> Go away.
<s> Wendy...
<s> Oh, well - come on in Jack.
<s> Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
<s> Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
<s> Well, that sounds fine to me.
<s> shut in together over long periods of time.
<s> Uncle Al-
<s> Sure, Uncle Al.
<s> Will you?
<s> What's that?
<s> A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
<s> What?
<s> I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
<s> Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
<s> What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
<s> We won't!
<s> Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
<s> I think they hear you!
<s> Were you tempted?
<s> We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
<s> 'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
<s> That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
<s> Why?
<s> But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
<s> Just about.  Show me again.
<s> Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
<s> No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
<s> And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
<s> Were you wicked?
<s> Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
<s> Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
<s> What?
<s> Give me a C.  A C!
<s> Oh no.  We'll always be together.
<s> Again?
<s> She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
<s> Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
<s> You mean black people?
<s> Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
<s> How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
<s> I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
<s> Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
<s> The majority has spoken.
<s> Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
<s> Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
<s> Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
<s> Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
<s> You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
<s> Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
<s> Hail, Mary.
<s> Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
<s> Not... totally.
<s> So, take it off.
<s> She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
<s> Neither did you!
<s> She's praying.
<s> Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
<s> Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
<s> But how do we get there?
<s> She said they were from her old convent.
<s> But where?
<s> Yes?
<s> Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
<s> I was afraid of this.
<s> I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
<s> Bring Young Masbath here.
<s> What of it?
<s> I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
<s> Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
<s> Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
<s> They need guidance.
<s> Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
<s> You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
<s> And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
<s> Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
<s> I'm sure I don't know.
<s> How could he?
<s> It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
<s> How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
<s> There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
<s> Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
<s> Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
<s> Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
<s> Yes, he does.  May I try?
<s> If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
<s> What did you say?
<s> He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
<s> It was you there?
<s> Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
<s> Yes.  Here...
<s> You are from the Hollow?
<s> Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
<s> You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
<s> Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
<s> I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
<s> Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
<s> No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
<s> Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
<s> Give me the big'uns.
<s> Karl's my name.
<s> Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
<s> You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
<s> He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
<s> I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
<s> Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
<s> No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
<s> I hate you!
<s> Don't rush ever'body, honey.
<s> A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
<s> I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
<s> I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
<s> Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
<s> I did live there in the state hospital.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
<s> I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
<s> Two people.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I recollect it.
<s> Pull on your works. Your privates.
<s> I don't reckon I know.
<s> Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
<s> My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
<s> A little ol' boy.
<s> I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
<s> I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
<s> Yes sir, I reckon it does.
<s> If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
<s> That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
<s> I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
<s> Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
<s> Did Vaughan go home?
<s> Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
<s> He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
<s> I ain't got no boy.
<s> I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
<s> I didn't aim to.
<s> It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
<s> Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
<s> I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
<s> What's that you say?
<s> I've heard it said that way.
<s> Oh. How about before that?
<s> Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
<s> Can I help you, sir?
<s> He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
<s> Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
<s> Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
<s> Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
<s> I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
<s> I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
<s> Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
<s> Huh?
<s> What's that, Sol?
<s> No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
<s> It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
<s> Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
<s> Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
<s> It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
<s> It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
<s> Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
<s> Not a peep.
<s> Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
<s> Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
<s> You got it.
<s> I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
<s> Anything for art, eh, Paul?
<s> Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
<s> It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
<s> Where to?
<s> You what?
<s> Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
<s> You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
<s> It's all yours, baby.
<s> Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
<s> Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
<s> It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
<s> Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
<s> Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> Say hi to Paul.
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
<s> No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
<s> Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
<s> You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
<s> That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
<s> In Manhattan?
<s> You can't be more specific than that?
<s> In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
<s> Nice drawing. Did you do that?
<s> Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
<s> I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
<s> It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
<s> Come on, just a little hint.
<s> Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
<s> Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
<s> I suppose so. He never told me about it.
<s> Good. I'm glad that's settled!
<s> If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
<s> You don't.
<s> I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
<s> So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
<s> In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
<s> So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
<s> But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
<s> I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
<s> Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
<s> I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
<s> My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
<s> Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
<s> Carl Heine came.
<s> I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
<s> Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
<s> No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
<s> Three kids.  What's she going to do?
<s> Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
<s> No, you don't.
<s> Fell.
<s> Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
<s> You ever been strangled by a single hand?
<s> I was checking the cables.
<s> Naw, I had that around for a while.
<s> Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
<s> Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
<s> Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
<s> Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
<s> Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
<s> I wouldn't say encouraged.
<s> That's all he said.
<s> Thank you ever so.
<s> Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
<s> Yeah.  Why?
<s> No we're not.
<s> Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
<s> I told you - it's a sure thing.
<s> Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
<s> - Type O.
<s> But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
<s> What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
<s> And I'm Daphne.
<s> Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
<s> Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
<s> You tore it again!
<s> I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
<s> It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
<s> You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
<s> What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
<s> Don't get burned, Daphne.
<s> Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
<s> Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
<s> Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
<s> Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
<s> Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
<s> Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
<s> So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
<s> Get me Room 414.
<s> We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
<s> I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Half-full.
<s> We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
<s> She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
<s> Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
<s> What's that?
<s> Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
<s> Or was it Bryn Mawr?
<s> Come on, Daphne.
<s> Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
<s> Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
<s> Do you suppose she went out shopping?
<s> I met one of them.
<s> Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
<s> Wanna bet?
<s> I'll throw up!
<s> Yes, Osgood?
<s> Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
<s> It's three weeks in Florida -
<s> I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
<s> My car?  Why, you -
<s> All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
<s> Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
<s> I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
<s> I'll say.
<s> Every time!
<s> Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
<s> Up, up, up.
<s> You're society girls?
<s> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
<s> Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
<s> Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
<s> Shells?  Whatever for?
<s> It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
<s> Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
<s> Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
<s> Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
<s> Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
<s> It's the crews' night off.
<s> You're flattering me.
<s> Oh, you couldn't possibly.
<s> Talk about sad.
<s> All right - if you insist.
<s> I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
<s> I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Mineral baths - now really!
<s> Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
<s> I told you - I'm not very bright.
<s> I know.  Every time!
<s> That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
<s> Booze.
<s> Go where?
<s> That's an opera, you ignoramus.
<s> Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
<s> Goodbye, Charlie.
<s> Hey.
<s> Jeffrey told her last night.
<s> Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
<s> I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
<s> And you do now?
<s> Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
<s> Not for a dog.
<s> When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
<s> Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
<s> Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
<s> A weekend?
<s> Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
<s> We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
<s> So, whyd you say yes to me?
<s> You have more than one gynecologist?
<s> Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
<s> Ahoy!
<s> ...but its getting there. 
<s> At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
<s> Will do.
<s> You don't live around here, do you?
<s> He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
<s> I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
<s> Yes, mam...
<s> Yes, Miss Johnson...
<s> She was dirty and wet...
<s> NO! N-O, NO!
<s> Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
<s> We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
<s> Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Children, come here...
<s> No mam -- I looked all over.
<s> Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
<s> Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
<s> I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
<s> Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
<s> He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
<s> Yes, ma'm...
<s> Little chilly.
<s> You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
<s> I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
<s> Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
<s> Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
<s> My head hurts.
<s> I said -
<s> They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
<s> We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
<s> Okay.
<s> I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
<s> It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
<s> Oh.
<s> You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
<s> I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
<s> I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
<s> Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
<s> Help yourself prickfuck!
<s> Norwegian Ass Raper.
<s> This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's... It's not good children.
<s> Uhh...
<s> Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
<s> Mrph mprph!!
<s> Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
<s> Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
<s> I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
<s> Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
<s> We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
<s> I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
<s> What's the difference?
<s> Yeah, they suck.
<s> All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
<s> What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
<s> Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
<s> Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
<s> As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
<s> Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
<s> Oh God... What have I done...
<s> No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
<s> You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
<s> Cheers, Terrance!
<s> I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
<s> Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
<s> Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
<s> My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
<s> Very professional of you.
<s> They are awaiting further information.
<s> My...wings...
<s> And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
<s> Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
<s> Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
<s> Taylor, you surprise me.
<s> I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
<s> Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
<s> Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
<s> Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
<s> I understand.
<s> Ready as I'll ever be.
<s> At this point I'm ready for anything.
<s> It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
<s> Hopefully sooner than later.
<s> Over and out.
<s> We have room!  Let's go!
<s> We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
<s> Try not to think about it.
<s> I don't know.  Wave to them!
<s> Is there anything I can help you with?
<s> That is one of my priorities.
<s> There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
<s> He's in the bathroom.
<s> Talk to him...Jesus...
<s> Baby, take it easy.
<s> Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
<s> Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
<s> I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
<s> I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
<s> The pin machine?
<s> Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
<s> Lemme see your ball.
<s> You listen to the feelings, not the words.
<s> Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
<s> You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
<s> Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
<s> Grace Skinner.
<s> Clam it!
<s> He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
<s> You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
<s> Who's there?
<s> Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
<s> Someone wants to play with me?
<s> How Mr. Kastle?
<s> Bowling "Center"!
<s> She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
<s> They suspended me.
<s> I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
<s> How do you want it?  The eggs.
<s> When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
<s> Not while I'm in training.
<s> No. Do You?
<s> I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
<s> Sheila, please.
<s> It?
<s> I feel sick.
<s> Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
<s> I'm looking for somebody.
<s> Calm down, Dr. Levine.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yeah.  I heard you.
<s> Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
<s> High Voltage?
<s> Pull it, damn it!
<s> What?
<s> It's impossible.
<s> But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
<s> What do you mean, he's missing?
<s> No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
<s> I think I do.
<s> But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
<s> Harry?  Can you copy?
<s> I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
<s> Yes, Harry.
<s> So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
<s> It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
<s> How do you mean, strange?
<s> She's not gonna know, sir.
<s> If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
<s> I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
<s> It never occurred to me.
<s> No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
<s> Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
<s> Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
<s> Yeah, why?
<s> They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
<s> Beth --
<s> I have to reset the sub.
<s> In case you die, too?
<s> You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
<s> Fixing it.
<s> It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
<s> This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
<s> Which I told Barnes was attacking --
<s> Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
<s> It's a soporific.
<s> "... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
<s> Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
<s> Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
<s> Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
<s> You think I manifested the snakes?
<s> One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
<s> It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
<s> It's either this... or I kill you.
<s> It's not safe for you to be either.
<s> Don't fuck with me, Beth.
<s> From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
<s> I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
<s> C'mon --
<s> Who says it's a he?
<s> You'd have to ask them.
<s> In time for what?
<s> Like what?  I'm not --
<s> Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
<s> What?
<s> To what?
<s> Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
<s> What noise?
<s> What are you still doing here?
<s> You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
<s> You don't understand about the sphere.
<s> That far in what, Harry?
<s> Did I?
<s> The three of us.
<s> Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
<s> Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
<s> I'm trying to keep balance with --
<s> Wait!
<s> You mean forget?
<s> Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
<s> Meaning?
<s> Please.  It must have flown here --
<s> Arrived?  From where?
<s> The ships?
<s> Who's everyone?
<s> What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> Why's that?
<s> You seen my suitcase?
<s> Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
<s> I don't know.
<s> The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
<s> I'm beginning not to like you.
<s> A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
<s> But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
<s> Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
<s> I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
<s> Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
<s> Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
<s> We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
<s> Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
<s> He'll be well cared for.
<s> I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
<s> Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
<s> It's what I deserve.
<s> What do I want with a scar ?
<s> YAAAAAAAA !
<s> Sir... I guess I do, sir.
<s> I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
<s> If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
<s> Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
<s> Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
<s> This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
<s> Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
<s> I don't want everyone to see.
<s> I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
<s> Did you get Starside R&D ?
<s> My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
<s> Alright, I love you.
<s> I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
<s> See you on the bounce !
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> No way, ma'am !
<s> Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
<s> No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
<s> A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
<s> My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
<s> Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
<s> He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
<s> Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
<s> Sir, yes, sir !
<s> I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
<s> Uh, no.
<s> Hi, mom.
<s> You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
<s> Been better, buddy.
<s> Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
<s> Cover us, Ace !
<s> We're not leaving you here, sir !
<s> Give'em hell, sir !
<s> That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
<s> You may proceede.
<s> The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<s> You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
<s> The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
<s> It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
<s> Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
<s> -- You, personally, are assuming command?
<s> No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
<s> Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
<s> The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
<s> Captain... I'd like to go along...
<s> Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
<s> That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
<s> Viewer ahead, sir.
<s> Sit down, please.
<s> Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
<s> I am seeking answers, Captain.
<s> And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
<s> Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
<s> Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
<s> The point... 
<s> Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
<s> Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
<s> Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
<s> Tractor beam remains constant...
<s> I'll be there.
<s> I need a typewritter.
<s> Who?
<s> Don't be so hard on yourself.
<s> It was either that, or a sardine.
<s> That's true.  You grow up here?
<s> As the Old Mill goes around...
<s> Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
<s> You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
<s> But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
<s> I don't drink.
<s> Then I'll come back, then.
<s> You believe that?
<s> Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
<s> <u>Please</u>...
<s> She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
<s> That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
<s> What?
<s> ...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
<s> ...I'm sure that people are upset...
<s> What is it, a surprise?
<s> Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
<s> That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
<s> Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
<s> Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
<s> That Could Be.
<s> I'm having dinner with W...
<s> But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
<s> Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
<s> She's a...
<s> What...
<s> Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
<s> How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
<s> You have to what?
<s> I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
<s> I like you, too.
<s> Yes, yes, but...
<s> Is...Is the Movie!
<s> I...I...
<s> ...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
<s> The minute I read that script I said...
<s> He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
<s> Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
<s> I, uh...I'm leaving.
<s> I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
<s> ...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
<s> You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
<s> I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
<s> What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
<s> How about that.
<s> He should be put in jail.
<s> Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
<s> Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
<s> I grew up on your mov...
<s> Why?
<s> I'm out.
<s> I have to tell the truth.
<s> We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
<s> Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
<s> There's no witnesses...
<s> Sherry, this...
<s> And we're glad to have you here...
<s> Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
<s> ...the city council...
<s> ...it is?
<s> It takes all kinds.
<s> Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
<s> I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
<s> I live.  In the same country.
<s> Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
<s> THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
<s> Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
<s> I'll miss you so much.
<s> Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
<s> He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
<s> Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
<s> You think this is funny?
<s> Not use my words, please!
<s> There's worse things.
<s> No.
<s> Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
<s> Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
<s> No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
<s> Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
<s> I helped.
<s> Rache says it's from you.
<s> Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
<s> Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
<s> Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
<s> At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
<s> Have you still never told him?
<s> We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
<s> Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
<s> Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
<s> You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
<s> No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
<s> I live or I die.
<s> Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
<s> I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
<s> I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
<s> Wowie.  How wonderful!
<s> I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
<s> You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
<s> Nobody likes a snoop.
<s> ...it's my problem, too.
<s> You're not dying.
<s> How would you know <u>anything</u>?
<s> See, I know that.
<s> Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
<s> Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
<s> He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
<s> Are we.
<s> Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
<s> So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
<s> That's not wh...
<s> You weren't passing 'em out.
<s> <u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
<s> Uh.  You hate my guts?
<s> Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
<s> Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
<s> It was a veal stock, I thi...
<s> But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
<s> Rache, get out of th...
<s> I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
<s> Well, they will be.
<s> You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
<s> ...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
<s> Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
<s> By way of saying you were unhappy.
<s> No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
<s> Thanks, Scoob.
<s> I'll be your guest!
<s> It was God's will.
<s> We had to work. My family was poor.
<s> This is work.
<s> My Jesus
<s> I know!
<s> You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
<s> Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
<s> Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
<s> Huh?
<s> You mean, again?
<s> Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
<s> You know he hated my story also.
<s> Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
<s> Just the same.
<s> I'm a documentary filmmaker.
<s> Yeah. I know.
<s> Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
<s> But what did you get on your SATs?
<s> Y-yes--
<s> What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
<s> You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
<s> Because I'll be firing at them.
<s> I don't see why they wouldn't be.
<s> It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
<s> Shut up!
<s> We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
<s> Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
<s> I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
<s> We can't--it's power driven!
<s> The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
<s> Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
<s> Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
<s> You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
<s> Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
<s> That's government property, Major.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
<s> That's a very wise deduction, General.
<s> Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
<s> When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
<s> I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
<s> Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
<s> Peace on earth.
<s> And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
<s> And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
<s> That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
<s> They're coming in now.
<s> General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
<s> Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
<s> Roger. One-three-eight.
<s> Lothar, take your checks now.
<s> Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
<s> Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
<s> Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
<s> Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
<s> Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
<s> They're moving apart.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
<s> Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
<s> Some kind of signaling.
<s> Forget it.
<s> Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
<s> Seond safety.
<s> Master Kong.
<s> Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
<s> He's dead.
<s> In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
<s> You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
<s> Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
<s> What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
<s> I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
<s> But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
<s> Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
<s> Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
<s> Knock yourself out.
<s> Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
<s> I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
<s> No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
<s> Hey, you said you did a video?
<s> What's it about?
<s> That's the rock star thing.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> So you can do an album cover?
<s> No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
<s> Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
<s> You know?
<s> Erica is in the van back there.
<s> She's in the van.
<s> So, how was the ride, kids?
<s> Yeah.
<s> In what way?
<s> Alright, Pony!
<s> Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
<s> See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
<s> "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
<s> Yes!
<s> Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
<s> He is?
<s> Military marching bands.
<s> Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
<s> He's drunk.
<s> I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
<s> Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
<s> Good, good. I, I hope he does.
<s> Will you just put the gun down?
<s> He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
<s> Look, your trespassing.
<s> Look, why do you care, huh?
<s> Look, look, just get off my property.
<s> You could've come over.
<s> Name one.
<s> Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
<s> I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
<s> ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
<s> Sooze.
<s> For a ride.
<s> Oh, no, no, no.
<s> Just go.
<s> Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
<s> Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
<s> The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
<s> No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
<s> Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
<s> Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
<s> Camel jockey.
<s> Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
<s> New York, huh?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think about you. I mean, a lot.
<s> What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
<s> Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
<s> Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
<s> Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
<s> Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
<s> Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
<s> You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
<s> Sorry, Kansas...
<s> Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
<s> Wayne Gretzky.
<s> Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
<s> Of course - of course!  Hands in...
<s> She thinks you went to the police.
<s> Y'think?
<s> Trix...
<s> No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
<s> Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
<s> Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
<s> Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
<s> Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
<s> Hold on...
<s> Oh yeah, you caught us...
<s> Maybe we can make a deal.
<s> I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
<s> Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
<s> Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
<s> I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
<s> I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
<s> Action! The scene starts.
<s> Hi, Artie.
<s> That was the general idea.
<s> Where's the bar?
<s> Nothing for Ladd?
<s> I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
<s> I just think pictures should say a little something.
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
<s> About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
<s> Why, you sweet kid.
<s> The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
<s> Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
<s> Phillip, you're mad!
<s> I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
<s> Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
<s> I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
<s> Sorry if I crossed you up.
<s> Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
<s> Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
<s> Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
<s> It must be my new shampoo.
<s> I don't want it now.
<s> Whose house is it?
<s> That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
<s> And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
<s> But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
<s> Yeah?
<s> They'll love it in Pomona.
<s> I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
<s> Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
<s> Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
<s> Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
<s> Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
<s> It's those feathers.  They tickle.
<s> Who?
<s> I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
<s> Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
<s> Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
<s> It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
<s> No, they don't.
<s> You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
<s> Wipe your feet!
<s> Madame is waiting.
<s> Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
<s> Good.
<s> Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
<s> Who?
<s> Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
<s> The cameras have arrived, Madame.
<s> But which one?
<s> And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
<s> No, a super girl.
<s> No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
<s> You love me?
<s> No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
<s> Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
<s> What do you feel about me?
<s> No.
<s> Well...I guess one is all right.
<s> Terrific.
<s> It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
<s> Are you asking me for a "date"?
<s> It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
<s> You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
<s> I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
<s> You vicious--
<s> I don't know. You seem afraid.
<s> I've got things to do.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Did anybody notice you?
<s> Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
<s> As brave as my father. As wise.
<s> It's going to be a tree, I think.
<s> This is all your clothes?
<s> You're not...an orphan are you?
<s> He's nice.
<s> I'm Linda Lee.
<s> You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
<s> Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
<s> ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
<s> I know.
<s> Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
<s> Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
<s> Don't stop. Keep moving.
<s> There's no vodka in it.
<s> Brad.
<s> The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
<s> Too much mayonnaise?
<s> Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Can I help?
<s> Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
<s> Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
<s> Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<s> Oh. You're going away.
<s> Nope, but --
<s> Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
<s> What about this week's check?
<s> Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
<s> Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
<s> Columbia.
<s> First question got to be "Where."
<s> What are you talking about, fella?
<s> God, that's what I keep you for.
<s> KRYPTONITE!
<s> We've already got some.
<s> Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
<s> Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
<s> Watch out for them air pockets!
<s> And do what?
<s> Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
<s> What about me?
<s> I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
<s> The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
<s> Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
<s> Turn on the light.
<s> Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
<s> Hello.
<s> We already have a super-tanker.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
<s> Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
<s> Be my guest.
<s> In July???
<s> Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
<s> Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
<s> I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
<s> Oh come on, that's ridic -
<s> Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
<s> Let's go to my place.
<s> Say you love me.
<s> I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
<s> Oh, hi.
<s> Lois, I really don't see why --
<s> Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
<s> That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
<s> Does she know about it? She's in it!
<s> The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
<s> That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
<s> What's a curl?
<s> Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
<s> I want my Liberace record back tonight.
<s> I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
<s> Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
<s> Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
<s> 		DELETE IN CUTTING
<s> What shall we do now?
<s> And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
<s> And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
<s> Don't worry, I've got you.
<s> You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
<s> You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
<s> Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
<s> . . . And  very nave!
<s> An angle?
<s> Our other dinner guest.
<s> A toupee that flies?
<s> What?
<s> Ready, Uncle Lex?
<s> Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
<s> High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
<s> No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
<s> We're running out of smoke.
<s> And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
<s> It was hot, yes.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
<s> I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
<s> Jealous? Of what?
<s> It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
<s> You're not the only one.
<s> Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
<s> Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
<s> Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
<s> What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
<s> Bingo!
<s> You?! How about me?
<s> If you persist, you leave us no choice.
<s> Gets you where you live, huh?
<s> Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
<s> What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
<s> A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
<s> Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
<s> Right on the first guess.
<s> Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
<s> You think they're strange?
<s> I guess they are a little odd.
<s> What about it?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Pink.
<s> Yessir. Just what you wanted.
<s> I guess I...uh...regressed.
<s> It is for me.
<s> Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
<s> Alison Jones.
<s> He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
<s> Are you still in touch?
<s> Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
<s> Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
<s> I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
<s> No you don't.
<s> No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
<s> Was it good?
<s> Okay.
<s> Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
<s> Can't you make it later?
<s> A while.
<s> Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
<s> Good night.
<s> Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
<s> Berries.
<s> Yes.  He does.
<s> A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
<s> No.  A little sugar though.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> What's a ditty again?
<s> Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
<s> What, Mason?
<s> Oh.
<s> Will you be spending more than a night?
<s> There's the Prescots...
<s> No.
<s> Perfect.
<s> A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
<s> Is there shrimp on it?
<s> You can't come here.
<s> Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
<s> Yes.
<s> About eight-thirty in the morning.
<s> Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
<s> Positive.
<s> How will he do that?
<s> I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
<s> But Charlene...
<s> The Ottos.
<s> You don't know that.
<s> Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
<s> Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
<s> Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
<s> Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
<s> And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
<s> Hurry back.
<s> Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
<s> Who said Sidney?
<s> I have a message from your sister.
<s> You print them, don't you?
<s> I didn't say that, J.J.
<s> I'll listen one more minute.
<s> Are you finished?
<s> Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
<s> Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
<s> He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
<s> He goes out with girls.
<s> At the bar - Sidney...
<s> ...cigarette girls... And naturally -
<s> I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
<s> But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
<s> Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
<s> May I rent you out as an adding machine.
<s> I know you do, Sidney.
<s> It is a favor, isn't it?
<s> Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
<s> Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
<s> I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
<s> Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
<s> Max.
<s> Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
<s> You told me to.
<s> That is one of my mission parameters.
<s> Right.
<s> A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
<s> Smile?
<s> No.
<s> I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
<s> Where you going?!
<s> Yes.  Throw it in.
<s> I'm sorry, John.
<s> I have to go away, John.
<s> Gimme that Phillips right there.
<s> Where'd you learn all this stuff?
<s> I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
<s> It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
<s> Why him?
<s> Then what?
<s> And Skynet fights back.
<s> Yes.
<s> Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
<s> That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
<s> For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
<s> Some.
<s> I guess it's possible.
<s> But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
<s> Your manner.
<s> A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
<s> What museum?
<s> I have a duty.
<s> Yes.
<s> The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwngler?
<s> What is this, Emmi?
<s> I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
<s> Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
<s> It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
<s> How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
<s> You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
<s> Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
<s> This is absolute nonsense!
<s> You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
<s> Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
<s> It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
<s> Who's he?
<s> His private life?
<s> Jeez, and I never heard of him.
<s> You're late.
<s> The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
<s> Alright!
<s> That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
<s> I hate the beige one.
<s> We will, kiddo.
<s> No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
<s> One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
<s> White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
<s> Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
<s> It's okay.  Forget it.
<s> That's not my mission.
<s> Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
<s> Someone?
<s> Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
<s> You'll beg for mercy in a second.
<s> You're not supposed to.
<s> With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
<s> Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
<s> I just called.
<s> To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
<s> Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
<s> You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
<s> What are you babbling about, psycho?
<s> You first.
<s> I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
<s> Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
<s> Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
<s> I think not.
<s> That tall, bright building.  Near there.
<s> Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
<s> Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
<s> Who the fuck cares?
<s> I'm back from the dead.
<s> You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
<s> Where'd you get that gun?
<s> Stop talking...
<s> You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
<s> That's not true...
<s> No...
<s> "Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
<s> Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm going to call.
<s> They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
<s> Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
<s> Stop it!
<s> Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
<s> There's nothing to forgive.
<s> I hope.
<s> You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
<s> I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> A game?
<s> Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
<s> You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
<s> What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
<s> I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
<s> Don't take another step.
<s> Have we met?
<s> Thank you.  Goodnight.
<s> Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
<s> Fine.
<s> He came to my mind recently, that's all.
<s> Goodnight.  Where was she?
<s> Your brother.  Will you come with me?
<s> Look, where is he?!
<s> A Mister... Seymour Butts.
<s> Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
<s> Follow me.
<s> Attempted murder.
<s> It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
<s> Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
<s> The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
<s> We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
<s> Mary, I'll meet you outside.
<s> This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
<s> I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
<s> How'd I know it was for you?
<s> Good.
<s> Mary came with me.
<s> Nell, what do we do?
<s> Who?
<s> I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
<s> You're okay.
<s> You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
<s> David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
<s> I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
<s> I think so.
<s> Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
<s> Just had to be sure.
<s> Well, you're certainly not a person.
<s> Why?
<s> Like you.
<s> I'm a gracious host.
<s> We think?
<s> Why not?
<s> What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
<s> We'll find him.
<s> Been to the Boat Show.
<s> Round about, yeah.
<s> Y'what?
<s> Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
<s> Not me, man.
<s> Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
<s> Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
<s> How'd the two of you hook up, then?
<s> Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
<s> See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
<s> You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
<s> Not much -- you?
<s> Well, those are the breaks.
<s> Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
<s> It's been a while.
<s> Now who's being sarcastic?
<s> How'd you manage that, then.
<s> Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
<s> Yesterday.  Afternoon.
<s> Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
<s> What'd your father do?
<s> Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
<s> A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
<s> I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
<s> What's in Big Sur?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
<s> Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
<s> I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
<s> Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
<s> Eh?
<s> He had urgent business in the north.
<s> Unless I'm not who I think I am.
<s> The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
<s> Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
<s> And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
<s> I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> You know I don't live with him.
<s> That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
<s> About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
<s> The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
<s> He didn't say that.
<s> ...Uh-huh.
<s> Birdy--
<s> Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Huh.
<s> I can get it, yeah.
<s> Ed.
<s> $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
<s> Big Dave--
<s> Honey...
<s> Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
<s> I took Doris's keys.
<s> ...a puny player on the great world's stage...
<s> Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
<s> He a good man?
<s> Sorry, I just didn't remember.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
<s> Crane. Ed Crane.
<s> My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
<s> The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
<s> What's the combination?
<s> Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
<s> I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
<s> I believed them.
<s> Correct.
<s> The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
<s> I know.
<s> All right everybody, hold up!
<s> Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
<s> Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
<s> So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
<s> We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
<s> No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<s> Look who's here, Margo.
<s> Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
<s> They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
<s> I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Big as a house.
<s> The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
<s> With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> You loved him.
<s> Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
<s> A monster?
<s> I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
<s> I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
<s> I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
<s> No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
<s> We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
<s> The planetarium!
<s> I can't!
<s> I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<s> <i>A month.</i>
<s> You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
<s> --a dead one at that.
<s> But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
<s> A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
<s> They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
<s> You think she'd go through with it?
<s> No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
<s> Nursery?
<s> <i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
<s> A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm late.
<s> --Truman, you're gonna be late!
<s> Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
<s> You can count on it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
<s> Yes. I know.
<s> Nothing completely conclusive --
<s> Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
<s> Kurtzweil, we think.
<s> No. Don't bother.
<s> Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
<s> Your guess?
<s> I told you -- he and I were old friends --
<s> Where are you, Scully?
<s> I think they have that covered.
<s> I'm in the vending room.
<s> I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
<s> I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
<s> They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
<s> I was until about an hour ago.
<s> Evidence of a massive infection.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
<s> This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
<s> The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
<s> We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
<s> I need you on this, Scully --
<s> I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
<s> Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
<s> How deep does this go?
<s> A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
<s> Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
<s> We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
<s> A pocketful of rye...
<s> Lucien Baines?
<s> She thinks I can bring Edward back.
<s> Shush.
<s> If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
<s> Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
<s> As far as I needed.
<s> Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
<s> You don't know the procedure.
<s> This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
<s> He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
<s> Okay, okay...
<s> Yep.  Eloped.
<s> You're kidding me.
<s> Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
<s> I think that's the whole point.
<s> Sometime yesterday morning.
<s> Yes.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
<s> What else do we do?!
<s> I don't have to.
<s> Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
<s> Anna.
<s> Wait here.
<s> He told you, didn't he?
<s> I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
<s> Oh...
<s> He's safe in the Russian zone.
<s> I saw him today.
<s> From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
<s> And my passport?
<s> What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
<s> Two weeks ago.
<s> Where's Harry?
<s> Just around the corner.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Martins.
<s> Yes.
<s> Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
<s> You're not locking her up?
<s> Which side of the road?
<s> I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
<s> Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
<s> No, a major, were you really?
<s> It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
<s> I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
<s> Coffee.
<s> But he said he died instantaneously.
<s> A Roumanian.
<s> Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
<s> What's the name of this girl?
<s> I have guests waiting.
<s> In great pain?
<s> Who?
<s> Mr. Lime - yes.
<s> und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
<s> Who else?
<s> I am not a bad man.
<s> Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
<s> Funny?
<s> Oh.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't think so.
<s> Traveler.
<s> I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
<s> Good morning.
<s> She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
<s> Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
<s> So how many miles do you think it is?
<s> Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
<s> Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
<s> We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
<s> There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
<s> Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
<s> That's a movie, you moron.
<s> People still need values, beliefs....
<s> Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
<s> He's at a home out here.
<s> No.
<s> Why not?
<s> Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
<s> Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
<s> He's Jewish? Manzetti?
<s> Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
<s> German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
<s> A poison...?
<s> What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
<s> Notice? Like what...?
<s> Are all Jews the same?
<s> It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
<s> Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
<s> A forty-five.
<s> ...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
<s> Daniel Balint.
<s> From the Rhineland originally.
<s> Steve...
<s> They're not my people....
<s> Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
<s> No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
<s> You said they didn't have night guards.
<s> So what do we do with the device?
<s> Get out of my way.
<s> The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
<s> Obviously.
<s> Fund-raising??
<s> Danny, please, we don't want to know.
<s> Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
<s> Yes.  Not like Enzo.
<s> No.
<s> What kind?
<s> Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
<s> Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
<s> Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
<s> Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
<s> Congratulations, Enzo.
<s> Enzo!
<s> You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
<s> Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
<s> The rules are the rules.
<s> Fine!
<s> Great!
<s> I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
<s> No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
<s> Yes.
<s> No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
<s> So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
<s> Well that's very nice of you.
<s> I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
<s> Only to help the medics, I assure you.
<s> Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
<s> You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
<s> ... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
<s> I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
<s> Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
<s> ... Are you sure?
<s> No.
<s> No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
<s> Well... here.
<s> Louis, we were French!
<s> ... Sally?
<s> Again?
<s> What?
<s> I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
<s> But... how is he going to breathe?
<s> How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
<s> Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
<s> Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
<s> I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
<s> He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
<s> C'mon follow me.
<s> Kiss me you Semitic stud!
<s> When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
<s> Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
<s> I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
<s> The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
<s> Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
<s> I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
<s> It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
<s> What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
<s> Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
<s> Nice fellow?
<s> Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
<s> I sleep it off.
<s> You really think so, Charlie?
<s> You found the leopard!
<s> Let me see it 
<s> Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
<s> Hey  I'm over here.
<s> Good evening.
<s> Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
<s> I want to ask you something.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
<s> Thanks, Sheriff.
<s> Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
<s> Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
<s> I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
<s> Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
<s> We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
<s> The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
<s> Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
<s> I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
<s> We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
<s> Must it?
<s> Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
<s> Will you please come with me?
<s> Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
<s> Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
<s> Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
<s> Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
<s> You... You found that at Leons?
<s> I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
<s> Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
<s> Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
<s> How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> You wouldnt understand.
<s> Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
<s> Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
<s> Im fine standing, thank you.
<s> A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
<s> The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
<s> I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
<s> I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
<s> If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
<s> I see. How much?
<s> Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
<s> No... No...  I swear...
<s> Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
<s> Your secretary, huh!
<s> Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
<s> Does it matter?
<s> Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
<s> Should I come back in five minutes?
<s> No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
<s> Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...
<s> Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
<s> Can I get up now?
<s> Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
<s> The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
<s> Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
<s> ... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
<s> Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
<s> Tu sais o me trouver.
<s> Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
<s> Alors quoi?
<s> Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
<s> Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?
<s> Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
<s> Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
<s> Its a good guess...
<s> Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
<s> So... pretend it's not a game.
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> Now?
<s> Right.  Raymond... a priest.
<s> Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
<s> How dare you stop me doing God's will!
<s> Well...
<s> Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
<s> But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
<s> He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
<s> Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
<s> But... why... what's the point?
<s> I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
<s> You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
<s> And so I... I prefer my banner.
<s> To avoid killing anyone.
<s> Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
<s> We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
<s> To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
<s> We want her burned as a witch!
<s> ... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
<s> Not unless you hear my confession.
<s> Not unless you hear my confession.
<s> Yes.
<s> I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
<s> And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
<s> It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
<s> For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
<s> I'm... I'm not the king...
<s> Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
<s> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
<s> My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
<s> If there was, I didn't see it...
<s> Not yet.
<s> That'll put fire in my soldiers!
<s> I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
<s> I... submit to Our Lord.
<s> Nothing... just taking his teeth.
<s> That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
<s> No.
<s> I might ask you the same question.
<s> And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
<s> I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
<s> Oh no?  How about this one?
<s> So your memory's coming back?
<s> No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
<s> Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
<s> What for?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> I'm sure he'll forgive you.
<s> Why did she have to die?
<s> A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
<s> My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
<s> Wladek, please.
<s> Wladek, please.
<s> I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
<s> That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
<s> Just over a year.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Let's find out.
<s> What?
<s> Who's recruiting?
<s> But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
<s> What d'you mean, take the table away?
<s> Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
<s> Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
<s> Yes, so did the Germans.
<s> There are always notices going up.
<s> Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
<s> Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
<s> Like it were a piano?
<s> Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
<s> There is something to be said for silence
<s> Ohh the tag is broken.
<s> Yes, it's unholy.
<s> It was more to your wife that I gave it.
<s> You mean in signs?
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> What will I play?
<s> Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
<s> Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
<s> I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
<s> How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
<s> Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
<s> What?
<s> He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
<s> If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
<s> I'm busy, Floyd.
<s> They workin' for anybody?
<s> What do ya want the others to get?
<s> I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
<s> Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
<s> I never played for winos.
<s> Then you'll do it?
<s> Did he say he wouldn't?
<s> Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
<s> Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
<s> The name is Lonnegan.
<s> You're more gutless than I thought.
<s> You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
<s> You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
<s> 2:00 A.M.
<s> You got a system, Carver?
<s> What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
<s> You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
<s> No.
<s> Don't think I know him.
<s> If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
<s> Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
<s> For fifteen years.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It's all right.
<s> He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
<s> That is, if it's all right with you.
<s> Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
<s> You're high enough.
<s> You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
<s> It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
<s> I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
<s> Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
<s> Yes.
<s> was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
<s> Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
<s> I've got to see you alone!
<s> What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
<s> That's the truth.
<s> Yes, she would.
<s> A new invention?
<s> We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
<s> And he still wants to marry me!
<s> Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
<s> We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
<s> No.
<s> It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
<s> Nothing yet to cinch it.
<s> Rosebreen.
<s> --was Wynant's.
<s> Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
<s> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
<s> Go ahead!
<s> Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
<s> I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
<s> Well, don't you?
<s> Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
<s> Yes...
<s> I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
<s> Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
<s> That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
<s> He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
<s> Take it easy.
<s> That's jolly.
<s> They were kidding you.
<s> Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
<s> That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
<s> No.  It's a Christmas present.
<s> I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
<s> Let's see.  Where's it from?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Your guess is as good as mine.
<s> It's not going to hurt me to get up.
<s> I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
<s> You wouldn't be a widow long.
<s> Yes.
<s> I wish you'd tell me.
<s> I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
<s> Maybe she has.
<s> I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
<s> Baghdad.
<s> You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
<s> There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
<s> I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
<s> He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
<s> You just go when I say go.
<s> We can't just go off and--
<s> Move!
<s> I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
<s> Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
<s> Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Blow me.
<s> I did it!  I got the box open.
<s> We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
<s> I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
<s> I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
<s> I got that...sir.
<s> I heard it.
<s> I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
<s> Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
<s> Shut up and listen!
<s> What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
<s> Something like that.
<s> It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
<s> I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
<s> I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Makes two of us.
<s> It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
<s> The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
<s> Well, we should identify ourselves.
<s> Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
<s> Probably.
<s> And then what?
<s> You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
<s> But...
<s> A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
<s> You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
<s> Threatened to blow my brains out?
<s> Thought you were going to buy a car.
<s> Really?
<s> Just...want to be ready when we do.
<s> A headache?
<s> I'm saying don't do it accidently.
<s> Yeah, you're funny.
<s> Yeah.  So?
<s> What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
<s> It doesn't mean anything.
<s> It's a container.  Break the seal.
<s> I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
<s> Yeah, well, we're not.
<s> Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
<s> I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
<s> He lived through that?
<s> All last night he could have been--
<s> I'm not wasting my water on him.
<s> Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
<s> Now.
<s> Don't be so sure.
<s> Look,dirt!
<s> But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
<s> They don't know.
<s> What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
<s> We're leaving.
<s> I want you for my roommate.
<s> Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
<s> But you can't...you.
<s> No, I...
<s> Too late....stay close.
<s> No?
<s> I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
<s> I can't understand.  The sedatives....
<s> You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
<s> I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
<s> Where are they?
<s> Officer Reilly, vice.
<s> No thanks, Bev.
<s> That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
<s> So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
<s> Where...?
<s> I don't know. You tell me?
<s> What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
<s> Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
<s> Your partner?
<s> No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
<s> Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
<s> No excuses, just do it!
<s> Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
<s> Thank you.
<s> A ticking bomb...
<s> Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
<s> That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
<s> Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
<s> Fuck factor ten.

<s> Why should you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Gaston Monescu.
<s> What?
<s> Certainly!
<s> Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
<s> Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<s> That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
<s> Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
<s> Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
<s> Well--I am Madame Colet.

<s> For all the really important things--
<s> He started it.
<s> Because I hate him--because I love you!
<s> An hour, two at most.
<s> I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
<s> Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
<s> This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
<s> There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.

<s> I know what ice fishing is!
<s> Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.

<s> Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
<s> I see you.
<s> A mistake?
<s> Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?

<s> I could stand some more--
<s> Brett is the name.
<s> But--
<s> I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
<s> We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
<s> Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
<s> You take some awful chances.
<s> Think again--
<s> Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
<s> Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
<s> I should say not.
<s> What'll I say?

<s> Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
<s> Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.

<s> Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
<s> Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
<s> Well... If you insist.
<s> If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?

<s> You always got something to say.
<s> Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
<s> This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
<s> I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
<s> What is it, noontime?
<s> I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
<s> Like a veil has been lifted?
<s> You were in hell?
<s> I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
<s> Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
<s> What happened to your hand?
<s> Why didn't you catch a plane?
<s> As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
<s> Hattie is a different person now.
<s> I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
<s> Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
<s> I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
<s> No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.

<s> Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
<s> Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
<s> Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
<s> WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
<s> Go away.
<s> Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
<s> Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
<s> Don't tell me what to do!
<s> Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
<s> What?!
<s> What's with him?
<s> Heh-heh.
<s> Murderer!
<s> Did I get my package in the mail?
<s> Have you been replaced?
<s> That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
<s> Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
<s> No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
<s> Come on.  Let's get out of here.

<s> Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
<s> Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
<s> Why are you talking like that?
<s> Arnie, this is crazy.
<s> What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
<s> I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
<s> I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
<s> I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
<s> What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
<s> Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
<s> Me, too.
<s> She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
<s> Honey, your father knows the President.
<s> I don't know.
<s> How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.

<s> They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
<s> No.
<s> It's possible.
<s> Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
<s> I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
<s> Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
<s> I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
<s> I've no fucking cigarettes.
<s> For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
<s> Thanks.
<s> think I left something back at the -
<s> Right. You can't sleep here.
<s> No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
<s> Because it's illegal.
<s> Unless you get caught.
<s> Well, he's young and he's healthy.
<s> He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
<s> Now?
<s> My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
<s> Roald Dahl.
<s> OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
<s> That's your theory?
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
<s> Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
<s> About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
<s> Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
<s> Your usual table, sir?
<s> Such as?
<s> So what's it going to be?
<s> But where?
<s> No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
<s> It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
<s> Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
<s> DO it. Go to Red Alert.
<s> A Federation starship.
<s> Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
<s> With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
<s> The power was within you.
<s> I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
<s> Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
<s> Because it's there.
<s> Yes, Spock?
<s> Yes.
<s> If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
<s> A "t."
<s> I'll take you to the bridge.
<s> You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
<s> But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
<s> Am I? We'll see.
<s> Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
<s> I cannot go with you.
<s> Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
<s> Hi, Flynn.
<s> Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
<s> Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
<s> You call that getting over it?
<s> Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
<s> No...
<s> Right on the money!
<s> No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
<s> Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
<s> If you think -
<s> I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
<s> No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
<s> You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
<s> Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
<s> No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
<s> Yeah, I... oops!
<s> I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
<s> Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
<s> How about you?
<s> Probably.
<s> Alan-One...
<s> We have to talk.
<s> That's all going to change, Yori...
<s> As long as it gets us out of here
<s> Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
<s> It's something Users do.
<s> I'm shocked.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Okay, Dad.
<s> I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Roger, One.  Rolling.
<s> Yes.
<s> This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
<s> Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
<s> Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
<s> I'll just hang then, shall I?
<s> It can't be.  Not Helen.
<s> It can't be.
<s> The purse is still at the house.
<s> There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
<s> Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
<s> Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
<s> It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
<s> Yeah.  It was great.
<s> They must've just missed me.
<s> Louder please.
<s> Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
<s> No.  Doris.
<s> I'm not wearing any.
<s> Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
<s> God, you have great legs.
<s> What?
<s> I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
<s> No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
<s> Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
<s> I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
<s> We're going to Paris?
<s> You can't have just one.
<s> Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
<s> Get it.
<s> You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
<s> Would you like to get some pie?
<s> There's nothing to tell.
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> What's your favorite color?
<s> I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
<s> I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
<s> Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
<s> Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
<s> Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
<s> Why?
<s> No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
<s> Cancoon.
<s> It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
<s> You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
<s> I'm her husband.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> It'll get ya high.
<s> It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
<s> No shit? Dick, that's great!
<s> No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
<s> Really?
<s> I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
<s> Look, Dick, I don't -
<s> The police department?
<s> Sure. I didn't hear anything.
<s> I guess so. Follow me.
<s> I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
<s> I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
<s> I bullshitted him.
<s> Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
<s> Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
<s> Do tell. Why drug related?
<s> Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
<s> Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
<s> Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
<s> We talked him into it.
<s> Not a tiny little vial -
<s> Or a supporting actor -
<s> Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
<s> Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
<s> Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
<s> Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
<s> You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
<s> No way, Jos.
<s> I'm not wearing a bra.
<s> No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
<s> Do you know where we can find him?
<s> We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
<s> For a man in your position...an opportunity.
<s> This is it, James...what you've been working for.
<s> What's she doing?
<s> No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
<s> I need to go.
<s> Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
<s> 1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
<s> Clues?  What kind of clues?
<s> Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
<s> Who's keeping an eye on you?
<s> James, why don't we...?
<s> You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
<s> And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
<s> You have to give yourself up, you know.
<s> A Carpet Cleaning Company?
<s> They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
<s> Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
<s> And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
<s> Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
<s> Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
<s> Then how come she knows what's going on?
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> Yeah, sure.  You got change?
<s> Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
<s> Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
<s> If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
<s> Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
<s> Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
<s> Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
<s> I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
<s> Then you ain't gonna have the car.
<s> Yeah, you better remember that.
<s> You got beer?
<s> Let me have a Beck's.
<s> Yeah, I'll try.
<s> Sheriff Potter.
<s> I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
<s> 'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
<s> What?
<s> You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
<s> You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
<s> You live pretty good.
<s> If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
<s> What about us?
<s> Don't yell at me!
<s> You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
<s> What about him?
<s> Give him the money.
<s> He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
<s> He was going to--
<s> I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
<s> I think I busted my leg.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
<s> I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
<s> I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
<s> I did?
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> I need thirteen.
<s> Do we shake hands?
<s> How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
<s> Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
<s> You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
<s> And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
<s> That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
<s> Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
<s> That country shit all sounds the same to me.
<s> She's dead.
<s> I've had time to get over it.
<s> No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
<s> Get away from me!
<s> Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
<s> A hundred-forty-five really.
<s> Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
<s> Jesus!
<s> I guess.
<s> Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
<s> I don't understand what the--
<s> Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
<s> And you're taking?
<s> Yeah, sure.  You got change?
<s> See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
<s> Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
<s> You afraid of the dark?
<s> You know I won't be seeing you.
<s> Accident.
<s> Bobby Cooper.
<s> An overheated car.
<s> It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
<s> Ah, I can smell it on you.
<s> Like you don't know.
<s> Would I what?
<s> I was hoping we could talk.
<s> A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
<s> You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
<s> That country shit all sounds the same to me.
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
<s> Don't look like nothing.
<s> You believe that?
<s> I want my car.
<s> All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
<s> A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
<s> It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
<s> I have an idea.
<s> Still playing?
<s> How do you know he's still not here?
<s> Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
<s> You could leave him.
<s> Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
<s> Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
<s> I don't think we have anything to talk about.
<s> I thought you couldn't get your car.
<s> Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
<s> But I thought --
<s> Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
<s> No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
<s> Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
<s> Where to?
<s> One way.
<s> No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
<s> No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
<s> Sure, I'll try.
<s> Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
<s> Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
<s> I want my lawyer!
<s> Oh.
<s> Yes.
<s> You've made a considerably wise decision.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yes. Is this David?
<s> My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's finished. I won.
<s> You've misunderstood.
<s> Are you for real?
<s> You're skill.
<s> Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
<s> No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
<s> We are.
<s> What's he look like?
<s> There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
<s> I want to sleep here tonight.
<s> I won't make any noise.
<s> I'll help you.
<s> Get mom.
<s> I see.
<s> Is that right?
<s> I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
<s> Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
<s> Thank God.
<s> I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
<s> Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
<s> 'Course he's coming.
<s> Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
<s> Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
<s> I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
<s> Shit and fried eggs.
<s> Those cowboys messin' him up?
<s> You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
<s> You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
<s> Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
<s> ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
<s> Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
<s> You could run off them two cowboys.
<s> What's your name?
<s> N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
<s> Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
<s> Is... is it... loaded?
<s> Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
<s> Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
<s> In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
<s> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
<s> You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
<s> He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
<s> If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
<s> Two weeks, I guess.
<s> Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
<s> I didn't see nothin' planted.
<s> You're marking us, Bill.
<s> Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
<s> He's dead, Bill.
<s> I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
<s> Two more hogs got the fever.
<s> I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
<s> The Kid, yeah...
<s> Did I what?
<s> Thought you was followin' me.
<s> Nothin's bent.
<s> Yeah?
<s> He's blind, for Chri...
<s> We'll bury him.
<s> No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
<s> Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
<s> They ruined me tonight.
<s> Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
<s> How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
<s> If you'll just let me -
<s> Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
<s> The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
<s> Waste of time.
<s> He didn't have my lawyer.
<s> I'm not a rat.
<s> What lawyer?
<s> The D.A. gave me immunity.
<s> Is he the one that killed Keaton?
<s> Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT.

Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
<s> Give a guy a break, huh?
<s> McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
<s> I never heard of him.
<s> He wanted me to live.
<s> The district attorney's office will comply provided -
<s> Abrams...
<s> Nothing.
<s> No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
<s> ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
<s> Yes.
<s> When she...
<s> ...We did everything we could...
<s> Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
<s> ...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
<s> Nothing further, your Honor.
<s> No.
<s> You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
<s> I thought I would need it.
<s> I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
<s> Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
<s> What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> It was good of you to meet...
<s> That's what I'd planned to...
<s> No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
<s> I.  Yes.  It is.
<s> Why?
<s> ... that's perfectly all right.
<s> ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
<s> I've got nothing to say to you.
<s> My client can't walk, your Honor.
<s> ...things change.
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
<s> If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
<s> I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
<s> From the magazine?
<s> Still looking.
<s> Yes.  It was, actually.
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
<s> Don't touch anything.
<s> What?
<s> Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
<s> ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
<s> Right.
<s> I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
<s> I can't talk now.
<s> Yeah.  I'm awake.
<s> We got to talk.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
<s> We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
<s> Yes...
<s> These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
<s> I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
<s> From whom?
<s> Have you talked to the doctors at all?
<s> We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
<s> But you knew about this.
<s> Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
<s> Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
<s> Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
<s> I -- I --
<s> Let me come in.
<s> Your name. And --
<s> Who you are --
<s> But you haven't lived here long.
<s> Okay.
<s> No, it's not right.
<s> Judy --
<s> We'll take it! Will it fit?
<s> You can.
<s> Ah, no!
<s> Too late. I've got my face on.
<s> Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
<s> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<s> I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
<s> Scottie --
<s> Take me away...
<s> No! Let me go!
<s> Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
<s> Yes!
<s> I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
<s> No.
<s> Oh! Yes! Here!
<s> No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
<s> Wander about.
<s> Some people prefer it.
<s> No... this is the first time for me, too.
<s> We have.
<s> Yes...
<s> Vaguely...
<s> A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
<s> No... it's in shadow.
<s> I know.
<s> There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
<s> And it's a all real.
<s> I love you too... too late... too late...
<s> You can't.
<s> To the church, I must go there.
<s> Please let me go.
<s> No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
<s> Ah, Johnny-O...
<s> That's following a train of thought.
<s> Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
<s> Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
<s> Do you know him well?
<s> And she died...
<s> Who's the guy, who's the wife?
<s> Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
<s> Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
<s> How?
<s> How soon can it be altered?
<s> Excellent.
<s> What?
<s> You're an asshole.
<s> It's sacrilegious.
<s> You want to hear me out?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Just giving the facts.
<s> So I didn't fucking do it!
<s> We've already done this.
<s> No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
<s> Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
<s> I know you'll be.  Three hours.
<s> No. I think it's fucked.
<s> I know...
<s> What happened? Oh my God...
<s> Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
<s> I got you.
<s> You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
<s> Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
<s> Who's up for making some real money?
<s> Shut up.
<s> You always were a jealous man.
<s> No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
<s> Suck my ass.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I don't know...
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> You have a King fantasy.
<s> Israel doesn't have a King.
<s> We missed the deadline.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I think so.
<s> How could I know what else I forgot?
<s> He's a moron.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> You don't like Moore? Since when?
<s> Of course.
<s> I'm not. What's the problem?
<s> What kind of seats can we have?
<s> Go down where?
<s> We're leaving in three hours.
<s> We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
<s> Of course.
<s> Now?
<s> Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
<s> We're not canceling.
<s> Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
<s> Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
<s> Buzzing?
<s> The wahoo?
<s> I got to agree with that.
<s> A move?
<s> I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
<s> That's what I'm thinking.
<s> No, the children sleep with me.
<s> You'd like me to kill them?
<s> Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
<s> Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
<s> What about them?
<s> No. Mother Superior told me to come.
<s> No.
<s> In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
<s> You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
<s> Nothing. I didn't say anything.
<s> No, but what a pity life is like that.
<s> Thank you, Uncle.
<s> You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
<s> Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes.
<s> Fifteen yards.
<s> And in the vegetable plot?
<s> No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
<s> Nothing.
<s> I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
<s> That your cousin is more to your taste.
<s> There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
<s> These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
<s> It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
<s> Do they worry you that much, then?
<s> No.
<s> Then let him go and he'll follow you.
<s> Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
<s> Why not?
<s> They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
<s> The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
<s> When you are, miss.
<s> Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
<s> Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
<s> I've seen worse.
<s> Where's my gun?
<s> Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
<s> I don't set policy.  You have the key?
<s> We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
<s> Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
<s> Not from in here.
<s> Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
<s> Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
<s> Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
<s> I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
<s> What you need is a collar.
<s> Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
<s> I know who would know.
<s> He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
<s> I'm still working on it.
<s> ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
<s> What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
<s> This isn't a game, Parker!
<s> You like baseball?
<s> Both.
<s> I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
<s> You don't know?
<s> DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
<s> You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...

<s> ...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
<s> ...and...
<s> Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
<s> What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
<s> I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
<s> And you?
<s> It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
<s> The American "people"?
<s> ...that's the general idea.
<s> The Hostages...?
<s> ... they're checking the ratings...uh...
<s> ...take a long view.
<s> Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
<s> No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...

<s> Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
<s> ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
<s> S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
<s> I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
<s> Why do people go to war?
<s> I have.
<s> Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
<s> When's he coming back...?
<s> We have some mutual friends in Washington.

<s> No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
<s> I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,

That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.

<s> ...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
<s> Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
<s> I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
<s> No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
<s> ...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
<s> Yeah, where's your machine gun.
<s> 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
<s> About what?
<s> ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
<s> No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
<s> That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
<s> Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
<s> What'd you tell him?
<s> Nah, she asked the wrong question.
<s> All right, Bud... let's do it.
<s> So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
<s> ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
<s> Yes...
<s> I'm sorry, this can't wait.
<s> I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
<s> Obviously...
<s> Excuse me.
<s> You could have a great beach house for that.
<s> Upper West Side.
<s> Yeah, almost...
<s> ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
<s> That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
<s> Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
<s> Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
<s> ...how do you know? You wish...
<s> Oh Christ!
<s> ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
<s> Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
<s> No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
<s> No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
<s> He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
<s> Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
<s> But he still has something Mark hasn't.
<s> Suffer?  We're living in America.
<s> China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
<s> Thank you
<s> Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
<s> You don't happen to have the address do ya?
<s> You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
<s> Mom.
<s> You guys are being real assholes
<s> Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> A ghost?
<s> No.  But once I heard...
<s> Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
<s> Fine.
<s> I am.
<s> Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
<s> Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
<s> Who?  Your husband?
<s> That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
<s> How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
<s> Very much.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You know where she is?
<s> Please leave me alone.
<s> Claire.
<s> I came in from my room...
<s> I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
<s> Okay, I'm a little tender.
<s> Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
<s> Shhh.
<s> Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
<s> No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
<s> All of us.
<s> No.
<s> If she was dangerous before--
<s> We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
<s> What is it?
<s> What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
<s> We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
<s> Norman Spencer.
<s> Don't.
<s> Three o'clock.
<s> Not the focus.
<s> I know.
<s> Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
<s> You are so brilliant.
<s> Well, that's nice.
<s> That's...
<s> What's going on, Claire?
<s> Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
<s> Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
<s> Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
<s> Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
<s> No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
<s> Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
<s> I...
<s> What's wrong with me?
<s> ...Please stop...
<s> What's the matter?
<s> So you fucked a student?!
<s> What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
<s> ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
<s> I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
<s> Don't think so.
<s> I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
<s> MADISON!
<s> :Well, they are.
<s> Then what is he...?
<s> Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
<s> A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
<s> A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
<s> Better than most, I suppose.
<s> Stop it!
<s> Go away!  I don't want you here.
<s> I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
<s> Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
<s> You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
<s> I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
<s> And whose houses do you design...?
<s> Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
<s> It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
<s> Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
<s> Mad. for each other.
<s> They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
<s> Let's see.
<s> It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
<s> He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
<s> I don't think of us that way - ever.
<s> Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
<s> That's GREAT!
<s> A little wine...?
<s> I love you too.
<s> Talking to me dear...?
<s> - we made a fire.
<s> A bit much.    Lucas.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
<s> I just - hate it when they're - finished.
<s> Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
<s> That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
<s> Is that a crack about our singing...?
<s> Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
<s> I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
<s> Yes - I have had it for years.
<s> Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
<s> Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
<s> I don't know...
<s> Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
<s> I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
<s> Did you?
<s> But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
<s> You heard me - keep away from him
<s> Yes I can...
<s> At home alone - where were you?
<s> I think you had better leave
<s> Oh...
<s> I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
<s> Yes...?
<s> Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
<s> Were you always this sick?
<s> Not ever. Never.
<s> Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
<s> Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
<s> God, I love being dead.
<s> Jealousy is so unattractive.
<s> From your lips, to God's ears.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You have changed since second grade.
<s> Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
<s> Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
<s> Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
<s> We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
<s> But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
<s> Dad, please.
<s> Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
<s> I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
<s> It's okay. You need me?
<s> I always knew there was more. I felt it.
<s> Whatever you want.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
<s> Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
<s> You mean they knew who I was?
<s> Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
<s> Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
<s> I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
<s> You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
<s> She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
<s> You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
<s> You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
<s> I meant biologically.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
<s> Your article sucked.
<s> You never know around here.
<s> Your dad taught you everything.
<s> It's incredibly simple.
<s> There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
<s> You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
<s> I'm trembling with excitement.
<s> What is all this? When are you coming home?
<s> We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
<s> Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
<s> Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
<s> I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
<s> You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
<s> Me? The King of Coitus?
<s> Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
<s> You think we should be more open minded?
<s> I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
<s> Really? So I'm doing OK?
<s> He was in a league of his own.
<s> --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
<s> I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
<s> I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
<s> Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
<s> It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
<s> Kelly Van Ryan...
<s> The teeth doin' any talkin'?
<s> I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
<s> And the child...
<s> Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> No.
<s> Suzie Toller is missing.
<s> You could tell me where you were last night.
<s> Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
<s> You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
<s> You have someplace to be?
<s> The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
<s> And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
<s> Where's Lombardo?
<s> The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
<s> Yeah, maybe, a little.
<s> So you were alone.
<s> No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
<s> You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
<s> The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
<s> And what do they say?
<s> Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
<s> I said he did.
<s> Your Honor... Please...
<s> Lombardo ever come out here?
<s> No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
<s> Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
<s> Curiosity, I guess.
<s> Police -- God -- get a life.
<s> I would hardly say you look like trash.
<s> In back of the garage.
<s> Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
<s> So you got my mom's money.
<s> You know what it takes.
<s> Duquette.  Forget him...
<s> And you believe her?
<s> You think that's wise?
<s> Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
<s> Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> That's right.
<s> That's right.  That was his name.
<s> The one you bought at school.
<s> Sit down, Lombardo.
<s> Put Kelly on too.
<s> The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
<s> We?
<s> I'll work on it.
<s> Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
<s> Hey, I tried the board.
<s> Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
<s> Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<s> He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
<s> Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
<s> This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
<s> I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
<s> Oh, I see, an easy plan!
<s> Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
<s> My... the wild west.
<s> Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
<s> I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
<s> You bring the best out in a man.
<s> My friend?
<s> Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
<s> It is?
<s> They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
<s> Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
<s> You managed alright.
<s> Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
<s> Me?
<s> My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
<s> My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
<s> Too bad you're not more like your father.
<s> I will!  But I need help!
<s> Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
<s> The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
<s> That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
<s> Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
<s> I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
<s> That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
<s> Shhhhh!
<s> His will.
<s> He never misses.
<s> Ouch!  Let go of me!
<s> Shut up.
<s> I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
<s> No... I saw the man who killed him.
<s> Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
<s> The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
<s> Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
<s> Just us.
<s> Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
<s> Don't try me, Johnny!
<s> Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
<s> No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
<s> No.
<s> Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
<s> Oh. The bullets.
<s> I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
<s> I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
<s> Aren't you? After today?
<s> Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
<s> That's your way, not mine.
<s> Where's my baggy pants?
<s> Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
<s> I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
<s> Say again?
<s> What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
<s> I have done nothing against the ordnung.
<s> Yes. Samuel! We're going.
<s> I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
<s> Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
<s> Ohhh!
<s> Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
<s> This?
<s> Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
<s> That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
<s> No, I'm afraid I didn't.
<s> Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
<s> I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
<s> Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
<s> Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
<s> Lions and tigers and bears!
<s> No, but you tried to.
<s> Oh.
<s> Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
<s> Hah!
<s> I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
<s> They would?
<s> Where's Kansas?
<s> Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
<s> Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
<s> Don't you start it, too!
<s> Yeah!
<s> Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
<s> Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
<s> B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
<s> I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
<s> Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
<s> You put up a great fight, Lion.
<s> Yes -- how about Dorothy?
<s> Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
<s> Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
<s> I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
<s> Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
<s> Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
<s> Quite the opposite, in fact.
<s> Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
<s> Shes not a girl anymore.
<s> Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
<s> Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
<s> Yes.
<s> Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
<s> Always wanted to see the upper lines.
<s> I have to go to work.
<s> Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
<s> We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
<s> Not interested.
<s> You turned Renard.
<s> How high up does this...arms dealing go?
<s> Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
<s> The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
<s> The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
<s> You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
<s> Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
<s> Wrong answers?
<s> Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
<s> Jon, no -- I can't --
<s> Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
<s> I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
<s> Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
<s> I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
<s> The missing scientists.
<s> What is it?  How does it work?
<s> You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
<s> Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
<s> His . . . whatever.
<s> I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
<s> The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
<s> Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
<s> Yes you are.
<s> Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
<s> Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
<s> What do you mean, frame-up?
<s> Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
<s> Janey, will you marry me?
<s> Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
<s> Isn't it true that you --
<s> What does this mean?  What does it --
<s> ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
<s> Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
<s> Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
<s> Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
<s> Is that a fact?
<s> I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
<s> Who says you're the good guys?
<s> You're a jerk-off, you know that?
<s> He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
<s> Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
<s> The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
<s> I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
<s> Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
<s> It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
<s> No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
<s> I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
<s> I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
<s> I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
<s> A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
<s> Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
<s> If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
<s> He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
<s> Let me.
<s> A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
<s> It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
<s> You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
<s> Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
<s> Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
<s> I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
<s> The corner. Anarchy 99.
<s> Been to any good diners lately?
<s> He's a pretty good actor, though.
<s> Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
<s> Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
<s> Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
<s> How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
<s> You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
<s> Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
<s> That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
<s> Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
<s> You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
<s> Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
<s> His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
<s> We have to find Magneto.
<s> Were you now?
<s> I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
<s> I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
<s> To find Rogue.
<s> Not at the cost of lives, Max.
<s> Ugly, vicious rumous.
<s> Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
<s> I did, sir.
<s> Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Is it that music?
<s> MMmmm.
<s> MMmmm.
<s> I promise.
<s> Oh, darling -- so will I.
<s> You bet your boots it does.
<s> Goodbye, darling!
<s> Darling!
<s> I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
<s> It seems fine.
<s> Does that include the key to the laboratory?
<s> May I have it, please?
<s> I don't know what you mean, sir.
<s> Will there be anything else?
<s> This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
<s> Break that old man's violin.
<s> A piece of what?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> Could be worse!
<s> Was he any good?
<s> This guy means business.
<s> But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
<s> You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
<s> ... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
<s> Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
<s> Act casual!
<s> What did you find out?
<s> How do you know it was a 'he'?
<s> How do you know it was a 'she'?
<s> Can you play it?
<s> What???
<s> I'll bet it's a doozy.
<s> Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
<s> Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
<s> Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
<s> Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
<s> Yes!
<s> Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
<s> What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
<s> No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
<s> Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
<s> Why don't we talk inside?
<s> ...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
<s> There must have been someone else down here then.
<s> The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
<s> Four
<s> Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
<s> Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
<s> I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
<s> Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
<s> Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
