<s> Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
<s> That's because it's such a nice one.
<s> Where?
<s> I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
<s> You're sweet.
<s> What crap?
<s> No
<s> Let's go.
<s> I don't have to be home 'til two.
<s> Expensive?
<s> Queen Harry?
<s> Can you at least start wearing a bra?
<s> What?
<s> It's just you.
<s> If Kat's not going, you're not going.
<s> So they tell me...
<s> North, actually.  How'd you   ?
<s> Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
<s> That's her?  Bianca's sister?
<s> Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
<s> In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
<s> No, I ' m not.
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> Just a little.
<s> I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
<s> I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
<s> "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
<s> Funny, you're the only one
<s> I know, just let me sleep
<s> You know what they say
<s> But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
<s> Busy
<s> My father wouldn't approve of that that
<s> I'm gettin' there
<s> He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
<s> No what?
<s> Oh huh
<s> It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
<s> Enough!
<s> Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
<s> Hi.
<s> Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
<s> Dr. Ruth?
<s> I know.
<s> You don't usually ask.
<s> Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
<s> Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
<s> Call them.
<s> Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
<s> Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
<s> You never learned how to speak my language.
<s> That's what it says.
<s> So was Christ!
<s> Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
<s> No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
<s> The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
<s> If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
<s> My horse doesn't work.
<s> Six days ago, yes.
<s> The land is there.  I know it!
<s> Yes, Your Majesty.
<s> He must be replaced.
<s> What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
<s> Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
<s> Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
<s> They won't until this is over.
<s> I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
<s> Pouring it out!
<s> ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
<s> I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
<s> Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
<s> Takin' a bath.
<s> Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
<s> I'll call it... tails.
<s> Of course.
<s> Something back home?
<s> You wanna talk to her alone?
<s> Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
<s> How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
<s> We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
<s> He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
<s> Alright?
<s> I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
<s> Could be Leon's.
<s> Answer the phone.
<s> Answer it.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
<s> Don't be late.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
<s> You stuff sausage in it.
<s> Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
<s> My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
<s> You'll be my first.
<s> Get down on your knees.
<s> Let her go!  Let her go!!
<s> Where's Czech girl?
<s> I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
<s> I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
<s> Don't want to film this?
<s> What does it look like?  It's an address book!
<s> Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
<s> No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
<s> Surprise!  Surprise!
<s> Milos.  Get my money!
<s> I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Oh yeah, why?
<s> Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
<s> That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
<s> Aren't you tired?
<s> What the hell happened?
<s> ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
<s> Okay, come on down.
<s> Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
<s> Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
<s> That seems very unlikely.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
<s> Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
<s> Thank you, Daddy.
<s> I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
<s> I'll bet it's a fortune.
<s> Well, I'm glad about that.
<s> We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
<s> There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
<s> I ain't tired yet.
<s> Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
<s> What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
<s> You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
<s> Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
<s> Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
<s> Thank you.
<s> At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
<s> I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
<s> Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
<s> I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
<s> Not likely, convict.
<s> Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
<s> I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
<s> You stay with me...
<s> Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
<s> You sure that's the reason?
<s> When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
<s> I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
<s> I'm heading out. How about you?
<s> I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
<s> Hey, you know what I really think?
<s> What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
<s> This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
<s> So what?
<s> In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
<s> Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
<s> You know exactly where they are!
<s> She's an exception..
<s> And then?
<s> White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
<s> What is?
<s> I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
<s> How many points you got left on your license?
<s> In your dreams! See you tonight!
<s> Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
<s> It's like a cab isn't it?
<s> Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
<s> Why not?
<s> Learning language.
<s> Apipoussan!
<s> Exactly.
<s> I love you...
<s> I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
<s> Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
<s> Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
<s> I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
<s> Yes, Sir!
<s> Do you know how much I missed you?
<s> You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
<s> Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
<s> Honey, I'm not, please...
<s> It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
<s> I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
<s> I just talked to her.
<s> Hmm.
<s> Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
<s> Is it?
<s> I remember him.
<s> What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
<s> We do.
<s> I know what you did.
<s> Don't bore me with that bullshit.
<s> Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
<s> I was well compensated.
<s> Never mind how I found you.
<s> Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
<s> Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
<s> Good for you.
<s> Max.
<s> You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
<s> How much?
<s> Four hundred a week, off the books.
<s> Twenty-five.
<s> So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
<s> Where does he sell it?
<s> He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
<s> It's their Presidential Suite.
<s> It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
<s> Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
<s> I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
<s> The checks were for odd amounts...
<s> For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
<s> No.
<s> She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's been six years.
<s> You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
<s> Those are her belongings.
<s> Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
<s> It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
<s> Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
<s> Yeah, I'm not so sure.
<s> We have matching luggage.
<s> Who?
<s> Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
<s> Your distraught.  It'll help...
<s> When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
<s> You're not taking my baby!
<s> She doesn't want me around
<s> Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
<s> Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
<s> Me too.
<s> No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
<s> They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
<s> When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
<s> No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
<s> I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
<s> Krueger is reality.
<s> That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
<s> Well we gotta do something!
<s> That's their problem.
<s> I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
<s> I want to talk about the baby.
<s> A lot of people think like that.
<s> 'Us?'
<s> Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
<s> What???
<s> Radiation level...constantly rising...
<s> Anything ---
<s> I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
<s> Who with?
<s> After torpedo room:  Report!
<s> It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
<s> - for horrors like yourself?
<s> On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
<s> That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
<s> Obviously.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Toward the Pole!
<s> Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
<s> Same old shit.
<s> Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
<s> Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
<s> Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
<s> That was me.
<s> Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
<s> You played for the Sox?
<s> What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
<s> Grandpa. My father. It's his.
<s> No.
<s> I know.
<s> I figured you already heard.
<s> Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
<s> Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hi honey.
<s> There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
<s> It's nice.
<s> Think they're alright?
<s> Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
<s> It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
<s> Yes. Here's your ticket.
<s> Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
<s> Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
<s> You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
<s> This town sucks.
<s> No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
<s> His office. You mean my old office.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
<s> Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
<s> Money.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
<s> You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
<s> It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
<s> That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
<s> Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
<s> We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
<s> No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
<s> Yes
<s> You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
<s> Jim...
<s> Over my dead body.
<s> Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
<s> Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
<s> They've gotta be joking.
<s> They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
<s> We're under attack.
<s> But...
<s> Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
<s> Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
<s> No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
<s> That's my job.
<s> Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
<s> Sir...
<s> They better. Fuel's almost gone.
<s> DO YOU SEE TEEM?
<s> Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
<s> Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
<s> Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
<s> Te...!
<s> But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
<s> There's nothing wrong with me!
<s> I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
<s> Ted, there's no time to explain.
<s> Ted, please be careful.
<s> I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
<s> Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
<s> The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
<s> Don't be too long.
<s> He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
<s> We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
<s> Scraps.
<s> Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
<s> Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
<s> Then Elaine was right.
<s> Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
<s> Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
<s> Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
<s> That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
<s> I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
<s> No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
<s> I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
<s> It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
<s> Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
<s> That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
<s> Yes?
<s> Who wants to be first?
<s> Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
<s> I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
<s> All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
<s> No. No thank you.
<s> That's right.
<s> Lay off, asshole.
<s> Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
<s> And still it fits?
<s> Why'd I do what?
<s> Uh, Matthew...
<s> My wife?  She worries about me.
<s> I appreciate your honesty, George.
<s> No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
<s> Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
<s> Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
<s> Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
<s> Do what?!  George-- ?!
<s> I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
<s> Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
<s> I got him.  Don't get pinned.
<s> Talk to me, Hudson.
<s> Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
<s> Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
<s> Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
<s> I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
<s> I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
<s> Sorry to disappoint you.
<s> Dead on all channels.
<s> It's insured.
<s> Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
<s> Let's waste him.  No offense.
<s> Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.

<s> Think of what?  We're fucked.
<s> Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
<s> Why do they tell little kids that?
<s> You mean dead.
<s> I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.

<s> But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
<s> Be careful!
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Yes. He is a little strange.
<s> Ah, now! Here she comes.
<s> Yes?
<s> Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
<s> Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
<s> Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
<s> Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
<s> What? On one hearing only?
<s> My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
<s> Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
<s> Thank you, Sire!
<s> Who told you this, Majesty?
<s> Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
<s> Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
<s> I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
<s> Well. There it is.
<s> Is she not here?
<s> How many?
<s> Really? What is it he's writing?
<s> I don't know. He has pains.
<s> Sublime! Utterly sublime!
<s> I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
<s> Can I see it?
<s> Madame.
<s> Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
<s> Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
<s> Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
<s> Ah!
<s> But this is absurd!
<s> Did you like it, then?
<s> She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
<s> Whom did they choose?
<s> I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
<s> Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
<s> How could I not?
<s> What dead? Who is dead?
<s> How much?
<s> You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
<s> Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
<s> My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
<s> What time?
<s> Please! Just one moment.
<s> Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
<s> Yes!
<s> I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
<s> I'm not leaving you.
<s> What for?
<s> But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
<s> Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
<s> Mozart -
<s> Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
<s> Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
<s> I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
<s> I regret it is not too familiar.
<s> He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
<s> My son, no one can speak for God.
<s> No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
<s> I can't wait.
<s> No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
<s> Come to my office, Miss Price.

<s> I wasn't hallucinating.
<s> I should be committed.
<s> No.
<s> You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
<s> Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
<s> London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
<s> The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
<s> Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
<s> I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
<s> Apparently so.
<s> I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
<s> It's circling us.
<s> I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
<s> Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
<s> You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
<s> If I was still alive, I probably would.
<s> Hello.
<s> Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
<s> He's on the telephone.
<s> No.
<s> Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
<s> Yes - sure
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
<s> All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
<s> That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
<s> The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
<s> Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
<s> Get out, get out!
<s> Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
<s> Well, you can. You always could.
<s> Line?
<s> Well
<s> No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
<s> Good for you. Come on.
<s> Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
<s> Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
<s> Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
<s> Mr. Sampson . . .
<s> And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
<s> Were you in Cluett's apartment?
<s> Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
<s> I'm afraid he's been stalling.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
<s> It's his life insurance money, you know.
<s> All right.
<s> Matt, come here!
<s> Come here, honey!
<s> A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
<s> Oh, you think I'm lying?
<s> Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
<s> Oh, Charlie again.
<s> Huh?
<s> That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
<s> They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
<s> I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
<s> That was two hours ago.
<s> You stay out of this, Bob.
<s> It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
<s> As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<s> Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
<s> They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
<s> Hey!
<s> He's been full of vinegar lately.
<s> She got two of them.
<s> So what do we do, General Lee?
<s> Then let me run the show, General Lee.
<s> A trap.
<s> Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
<s> Shakespeare.  He's European.
<s> Get buckets!
<s> The District Marshall
<s> Me get heap firewater --
<s> I had you covered.  From back there.
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
<s> You can shut up now.
<s> I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
<s> Damn. All that reading paid off.
<s> Ma.
<s> It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
<s> Jesse, we're outlaws.
<s> Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
<s> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> Shush.
<s> You were little Jesse James when you left.
<s> If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
<s> Nuh-huh ...
<s> I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
<s> Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
<s> You are a hell of a woman.
<s> He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
<s> You don't think God'll mind, do you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
<s> No.
<s> I just though you were awful cute.
<s> Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
<s> That is so gentlemanly of you.
<s> They had to be dealt with!
<s> Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
<s> Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
<s> I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
<s> I demand action.
<s> Pumpkin?
<s> You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
<s> Yes, dear.
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman.
<s> Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
<s> I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Oh God, I can't believe this.
<s> No.
<s> There was no ad in the Times.
<s> Leaving what?
<s> See you then.
<s> Just...say...no.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
<s> Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
<s> Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
<s> Growing. I'm glad you said that.
<s> Who's Ted Bundy?
<s> What's that?
<s> Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
<s> No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
<s> What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
<s> What do you think I do?
<s> Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
<s> He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
<s> Does he do this all the time?
<s> No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
<s> It's no problem
<s> Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
<s> We were both seven in 1969.
<s> Hmmm.
<s> No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
<s> No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
<s> Eerie. Really eerie.
<s> Oh really? I didn't know that.
<s> Don.
<s> Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
<s> Let's see...  That you were with-
<s> Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
<s> Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
<s> I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
<s> And?
<s> But Marcus denied it?
<s> Where was Marcus?
<s> So who was he with?
<s> No, Owen.
<s> You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
<s> Then you've gotta ask him about that.
<s> No way. You have this -- destiny.
<s> Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
<s> We're not gonna let it.
<s> ...Whaddo I do?
<s> Nothing.
<s> It's gonna get cold.
<s> ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
<s> What'd they ever do for you?
<s> Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
<s> That'd change with a criminal indictment.
<s> Oh hi.
<s> I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
<s> Skywire.
<s> I do!
<s> ...Do I?
<s> Maybe I'm going too fast.
<s> Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Were the flags for Teddy?
<s> Talk about work? Never!
<s> Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
<s> I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<s> I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
<s> In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
<s> We'll come up with the next big thing.
<s> Cool.
<s> I'm calling Gary.
<s> Where we going?
<s> ...Something like that. Yeah.
<s> No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
<s> But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
<s> Before they kill somebody else, too.
<s> You mean -- break in?
<s> And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
<s> What'd he say?
<s> Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
<s> I met this girl.
<s> Oh we're not going to the campus.
<s> She's a programmer?
<s> I've got a girlfriend, remember?
<s> #21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
<s> Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
<s> Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
<s> You may.
<s> I'd rather talk about Number Two.
<s> Oh, and Austin...
<s> Be careful.
<s> My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
<s> Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
<s> Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
<s> Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
<s> No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
<s> Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
<s> Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Sure.
<s> I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
<s> No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
<s> Do you want to talk to him?
<s> Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
<s> Not now, Austin.
<s> Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
<s> We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
<s> I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
<s> Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
<s> And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
<s> Yes.
<s> These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
<s> Dr. Evil?
<s> Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
<s> That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
<s> Not me.
<s> Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
<s> Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
<s> You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
<s> OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
<s> Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
<s> Really -- what happened in 1922?
<s> This isn't a game.
<s> We want to help...!
<s> I'll never marry you.
<s> And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
<s> Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
<s> Small talk.  Try the weather.
<s> Very good, Steed ...
<s> Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
<s> Barely.
<s> Always.  Except ...
<s> Not for a moment.
<s> I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
<s> Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
<s> Have we been invited?
<s> Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
<s> 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Still a bit chilly ...
<s> Have you any place in mind?
<s> Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
<s> Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
<s> I see.
<s> Surveillance? By whom?
<s> Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
<s> How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
<s> Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
<s> No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
<s> Guilty until proven innocent?
<s> I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
<s> I think so, thank you so much ...
<s> Both, actually.
<s> Really -- you went with him for two years.
<s> Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
<s> Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
<s> Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
<s> What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
<s> Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
<s> Maybe it had something to do.
<s> Yes, sir, I am.
<s> The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
<s> You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
<s> Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
<s> Quiet, Mother.
<s> They'll be up there in a half hour.
<s> What are you...
<s> That's more like it.
<s> You're a pimp?
<s> I'll take some.
<s> Milt?
<s> That's it.
<s> What do you mean, it changes?
<s> All right, who serves?
<s> Rick!
<s> Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
<s> No. Let's at least finish the set.
<s> The phone made me do it!
<s> Olivier's in that, right?
<s> The best table in the house.
<s> Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
<s> Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
<s> Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
<s> Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
<s> Maybe I did... I don't remember.
<s> -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
<s> Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
<s> Hey! You don't know me --
<s> I'm in heaven, Lt.
<s> Hey.
<s> Roll the hose.
<s> You're selling dad's boat?
<s> What are we going to do about this?
<s> You look great.
<s> So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
<s> Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
<s> Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
<s> Leave Stephen out of this --
<s> Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
<s> Just take it.
<s> It's a small town.
<s> Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
<s> -- Another backdraft.
<s> "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
<s> But he killed these guys.
<s> That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
<s> Are you going public with this?
<s> Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
<s> -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
<s> What the hell are we waiting for?
<s> Backdraft.
<s> Management were pin heads.
<s> Cute.
<s> Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
<s> -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
<s> Putty? On both doors?
<s> He works for me.
<s> You like everybody, Ronald.
<s> She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
<s> Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
<s> "The Strawberries"?
<s> Yes.
<s> Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
<s> All right, cop. I want my money.
<s> That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
<s> What case?
<s> Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
<s> You've really got a problem.
<s> I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
<s> Louder.  They can't hear you.
<s> Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
<s> So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
<s> Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
<s> Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
<s> Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
<s> Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
<s> I'm sorry I'm late.
<s> I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
<s> I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
<s> It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
<s> To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
<s> I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
<s> I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
<s> The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
<s> Always keep 'em laughing.
<s> Your father is proud of you.
<s> The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
<s> It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
<s> Which one is your brother?
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
<s> DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
<s> I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
<s> You sound like the media.
<s> Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
<s> Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
<s> I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
<s> I'll be right over.
<s> You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
<s> You've never had any formal training, either?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
<s> I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
<s> Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
<s> The one with da big...
<s> She hates dem.
<s> So when are you comin' to pick us up?
<s> ...too early...
<s> How be dat?
<s> Are you trying to rap to me?
<s> No, before my time.
<s> My people love me.
<s> Why don't you answer?
<s> The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
<s> How do you do, sir?
<s> The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
<s> Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
<s> On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
<s> Have you had one?
<s> Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
<s> But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
<s> As much as possible.
<s> In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
<s> I see.
<s> What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
<s> I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
<s> Black-eyed Sczortarska.
<s> Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
<s> It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
<s> We don't know. West is dead.
<s> Shut up.  West's dead.
<s> But not Pike's.
<s> One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
<s> Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
<s> West's. Any kindling for afire?
<s> No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
<s> Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
<s> I didn't kill him --
<s> So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
<s> No. I said Dunbar.
<s> Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
<s> He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
<s> Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
<s> I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
<s> I'm not even going to dignify that --
<s> You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
<s> You and the Colonel go back.
<s> Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
<s> See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
<s> I lost a bet.
<s> What point?
<s> Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
<s> What?
<s> That bugs you too?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Tough.
<s> I should probably write that down.
<s> The faggot speaks.
<s> Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
<s> Oh, you remember now --
<s> "You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
<s> Wrong answer --
<s> Childs.
<s> Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
<s> Shut up!
<s> No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
<s> Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
<s> He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
<s> That's great.
<s> Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
<s> Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
<s> A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
<s> No one's ever left.
<s> A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
<s> No.
<s> It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
<s> Eighteen.
<s> Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
<s> I know.
<s> Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
<s> You were talking about your wedding.
<s> What's your name, Giant?
<s> I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
<s> Really.
<s> What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
<s> You think I'm fake.
<s> The river?
<s> Story of my life.
<s> I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
<s> Really.
<s> Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
<s> Hello.
<s> This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
<s> Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
<s> We rented a car.
<s> But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
<s> Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
<s> What for?
<s> Leave him!
<s> Oh.  We are Russian.
<s> "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
<s> Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
<s> He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
<s> He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Happy bath day.
<s> Syevodnya
<s> Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
<s> It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
<s> Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
<s> Have you got your passport?
<s> I said I don't have any.
<s> I don't want to talk about him.
<s> No. But you tend to tie them up.
<s> Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
<s> And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
<s> Well what have you got?
<s> No.
<s> I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
<s> No. I think I better just go.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Oh! Gave me a start.
<s> Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
<s> Yes?
<s> You take her to a doctor?
<s> You gonna sing me somethin'?
<s> I need ya help again.
<s> You seen my snake-skin shoes?
<s> Hey.
<s> Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
<s> You gonna miss your bus.
<s> Sure.
<s> Make yourself at home. You done it already.
<s> I got others.
<s> Let go of my arm...
<s> BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
<s> BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
<s> Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
<s> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
<s> Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
<s> Itches.
<s> Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
<s> Anything.
<s> Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
<s> Huh?
<s> You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
<s> Don't know if God wanna see me.
<s> He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
<s> Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
<s> Not like that.
<s> She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
<s> Yes'sir.
<s> I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> Are you wasted?
<s> Got in a little accident.
<s> The hell are you talkin' about?
<s> You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
<s> Thanks.
<s> -- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
<s> Let go...
<s> -- I should tear your head off.
<s> Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
<s> I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
<s> I didn't know.
<s> Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
<s> High spirits, desire, commitment.
<s> Where would you look for the mafia?
<s> Give us a break...
<s> I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
<s> I can see that.
<s> He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
<s> Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
<s> Gaiijin.
<s> We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
<s> San is an honorable title.
<s> Let's go.  Him first.
<s> I can't...
<s> Me too.
<s> Luck.
<s> Gaiijin?
<s> You met her.
<s> I'm taking you back.
<s> I'm amused.
<s> Not in that company.
<s> He killed a police officer.
<s> It is not allowed.
<s> For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
<s> If anything happens to her while I'm here --
<s> You certainly have a nice place here.
<s> It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
<s> What about E.M.S. recombination?
<s> Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
<s> Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
<s> Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
<s> Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
<s> This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
<s> Why, yes, of course.
<s> Do you have something against science?
<s> Ya.
<s> Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
<s> I gotta piss.
<s> Four years.
<s> Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
<s> Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Nope.
<s> Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
<s> I bet I would.
<s> And who do I go to about you?
<s> Of course not.
<s> I'd never get an abortion.
<s> It would be my child.
<s> Right.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Dead.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Like?
<s> I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
<s> Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
<s> Five, maybe six.
<s> You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
<s> I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
<s> Hi.
<s> I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
<s> We sure did.
<s> No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
<s> She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
<s> How do you do?
<s> Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
<s> Shallow? I'm shallow?!
<s> Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
<s> You're lost?
<s> A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
<s> I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
<s> Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
<s> Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
<s> Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
<s> Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
<s> Doing what?
<s> My Mom and Dad.
<s> It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
<s> Oh, I'm sure it will!
<s> Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
<s> What for?
<s> Why?!
<s> Everybody's divorced.
<s> Is this your house?
<s> Good for you.
<s> So, what are you seeing?
<s> Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not that one!
<s> Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
<s> Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
<s> Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
<s> Thanks.
<s> Sing it to me.
<s> It was at least as good as the sky.
<s> They're pretty.  Can I have them?
<s> Blow out the candles!
<s> Your mom made that all by herself.
<s> Merci!
<s> Yes, father?! Yes?
<s> Okay. Thank you, my friends.
<s> No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
<s> I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
<s> Up there!!
<s> Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
<s> I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
<s> Well, we're here to help!
<s> Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
<s> I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
<s> Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
<s> Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
<s> He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
<s> What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
<s> "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
<s> Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
<s> I never know anymore.
<s> Would you like a tranquilizer?
<s> Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
<s> Yes...
<s> Would you excuse me?
<s> Just open the door.
<s> We do?
<s> --do as I say!
<s> I thought ten years.
<s> Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
<s> Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
<s> Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
<s> It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
<s> He left with Sophie.
<s> What?!
<s> You didn't stop anywhere else?!
<s> Come on.
<s> Where?!
<s> Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
<s> You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
<s> Yes.
<s> Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
<s> Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
<s> Only you and the photo lab.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
<s> Oh my God. Is her son OK?
<s> Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
<s> Jeffrey.
<s> See my nipples?
<s> Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
<s> That's not crazy. I like you too.
<s> Who's it, you mean.
<s> Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
<s> Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
<s> What do you want?
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
<s> Sometimes I think I do.
<s> No, it's not Don.
<s> Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
<s> You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> Speak to me Fucker.
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> Okay Frank.
<s> There ya go.
<s> Yeah. okay.
<s> Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
<s> Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
<s> Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
<s> Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
<s> I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
<s> No.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
<s> Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
<s> Aye.
<s> I can't find the second one, sir.
<s> What?
<s> Where's your gun?
<s> Get a hold of yourself, man.
<s> Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
<s> Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
<s> Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
<s> You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
<s> Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
<s> What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
<s> Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
<s> Be careful.
<s> Shut it. It's Ma.
<s> He got beat up by a girl.
<s> "I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
<s> German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
<s> Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
<s> Yes, we are.
<s> Holy shit. Who? How many?
<s> Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
<s> A-fuckin'-men!
<s> How do you figure?
<s> The fat man.
<s> Why do you always disrespect me like that?
<s> Shit! Shit!
<s> Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
<s> Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
<s> Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
<s> It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
<s> Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
<s> How long since your last confession, my son?
<s> Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
<s> I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
<s> He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
<s> No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
<s> Bob?
<s> No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
<s> Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
<s> No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
<s> After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
<s> This morning.
<s> I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
<s> Can you hand me those french fries.
<s> I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
<s> You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
<s> That's not correct.
<s> She needed it.
<s> Who's Mr. Henry?
<s> Let me feel that.
<s> Bob!
<s> Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
<s> Eleven fifteen.
<s> Any activity?
<s> Let's go. Come on.
<s> I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
<s> Pretty much everything.
<s> We're not sure.
<s> Behind Bob's house.
<s> We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
<s> Death.
<s> It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
<s> Let them fight.
<s> I didn't do anything.
<s> Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
<s> That's your friend Anthony?
<s> Well, this isn't really a party per se.
<s> I don't know about that.
<s> Yes. I did.
<s> I can't believe you said that.
<s> Maybe she turned.
<s> God DAMMIT.
<s> Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> That's good. Keep it at forty.
<s> No. I was calm.
<s> No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
<s> See you in a little while.
<s> My brother's in jail.
<s> We'll have to see when we get back.
<s> Watch me.
<s> You don't even know his name.
<s> What is it?
<s> That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
<s> I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
<s> He's having a heart attack or something.
<s> No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
<s> I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
<s> He said what?
<s> No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
<s> This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
<s> I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
<s> She is a good looking woman.
<s> One last push. One.
<s> Save it for Bourne.
<s> He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
<s> ...this is Conklin's computer.
<s> I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
<s> Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
<s> I'm sorry, Ward.
<s> What do you have, Danny?
<s> Okay... 
<s> I speak English.
<s> Okay.
<s> What?
<s> You killed them.
<s> YOU'RE A LIAR!
<s> I can't let you do that either.
<s> She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
<s> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
<s> But it ends up the same.
<s> You do?
<s> Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
<s> Yes.
<s> Bourne?
<s> Careful...
<s> Who's going? Us?
<s> -- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
<s> Here?
<s> That's where we came out.
<s> You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
<s> Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
<s> By who?
<s> And what about you, anything?
<s> You've all sworn to Longshanks.
<s> That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
<s> He will. I know he will.
<s> Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
<s> I have ordered conscriptions...
<s> Aye.
<s> Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
<s> I wanna have supper waitin'.
<s> Aye, we'll get 'em.
<s> I could crush you like a roach.
<s> I should'a remembered the eggs.
<s> A common thief.
<s> No. He did not.
<s> Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
<s> Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
<s> Nor I!
<s> Wake up, William. Wake up!
<s> A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
<s> I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
<s> Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
<s> Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
<s> When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
<s> Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
<s> But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
<s> You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
<s> Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
<s> Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
<s> You know my father?
<s> I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
<s> Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
<s> What the fuck are you doing?
<s> So let's go. This place creeps me out.
<s> Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
<s> Me? Are you kidding? Why?
<s> Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
<s> Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
<s> Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
<s> I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
<s> Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
<s> I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
<s> Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
<s> Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
<s> I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
<s> Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
<s> Gee, thanks friend.
<s> Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
<s> Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
<s> Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
<s> Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
<s> I came with Captain Renault.
<s> -- Will he keep his word?
<s> In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
<s> How long can I afford to stay closed?
<s> I don't buy or sell human beings.
<s> Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
<s> So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
<s> It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
<s> Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
<s> Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
<s> I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
<s> No, no, no, no. We must leave.
<s> Yes.
<s> Please.
<s> I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
<s> It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
<s> -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
<s> It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
<s> And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
<s> Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
<s> He suggested I ask you.
<s> I love you very much, my dear.
<s> Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
<s> Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
<s> I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
<s> My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
<s> But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
<s> Very well.
<s> We'll be there.
<s> Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
<s> By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
<s> I expected no less, Captain.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
<s> I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
<s> A leader, like Laszlo?
<s> But I have no excuse to close it.
<s> I stick my neck out for nobody.
<s> His escape.
<s> Why two?
<s> And got well paid for it on both occasions.
<s> Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> -- Hello, Ilsa.
<s> I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
<s> Serves me right for not being musical.
<s> Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
<s> In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
<s> I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Catch another fish tomorrow.
<s> Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
<s> Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
<s> Take it, damn it.
<s> Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
<s> You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
<s> No!
<s> You quitter you quitter you quitter.
<s> Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
<s> It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
<s> There was an unavoidable delay.
<s> As much as anybody.
<s> You don't seem too happy about it.
<s> A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
<s> You want to.
<s> Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
<s> I know.
<s> That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
<s> I don't know.  I really don't know.
<s> Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
<s> And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
<s> Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
<s> Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
<s> It was fifteen minutes late.
<s> But I might not have.
<s> It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
<s> This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
<s> I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
<s> You cook very well!
<s> I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
<s> He mentions Homer, too, you know.
<s> Really?
<s> I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
<s> I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
<s> "King Kong". It's really good.
<s> I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
<s> She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
<s> Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
<s> Fine. That's all there is to it then.
<s> What do you want me to *do*?
<s> You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
<s> Well, they aren't.
<s> You mean somebody asked?
<s> Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
<s> She looks after other people's children.
<s> Someone not from Maine.
<s> I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
<s> Have you enlisted?
<s> Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
<s> I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
<s> What about the trees?
<s> Right.
<s> You do it then.
<s> It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
<s> Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
<s> How long's this been going on, Muddy?
<s> Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
<s> Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
<s> Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
<s> Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
<s> Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
<s> She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
<s> Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
<s> And you have this letter of intent?
<s> You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
<s> Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
<s> Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
<s> Isn't it always?
<s> You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
<s> Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
<s> It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
<s> Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
<s> I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
<s> Let's go, Jake?
<s> How's that? He works for Gillette.
<s> She's up for it.
<s> And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
<s> We'll use the Euc.
<s> Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
<s> We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
<s> I said take off your fucking shirt.
<s> Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
<s> You interested in a little work?
<s> Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
<s> You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
<s> Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
<s> Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
<s> Why?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
<s> Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
<s> I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
<s> Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
<s> Then shut up.
<s> But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
<s> Do you have a ticket?
<s> That's no problem. We have those in stock.
<s> In over your head?
<s> Huh? Oh. She's alright.
<s> I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
<s> Then who's the Banker?
<s> It's not history.
<s> I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
<s> I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
<s> I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
<s> We're here.
<s> What do you get out of it?
<s> Roger that.
<s> It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
<s> That's what I'm talking about.
<s> Why did you quit?
<s> You called the casino a cesspit.
<s> I despise the job.
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
<s> What's the Blue Book price?
<s> Habib?
<s> South African women are very sporty.
<s> Who was he?
<s> Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<s> Not particularly.
<s> She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
<s> You want me drunk?
<s> It's not just inner beauty, is it?
<s> I. sold the car.
<s> Marion. It's a book.
<s> It's the truth.
<s> -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
<s> Never. Why do you ask?
<s> Then what?
<s> Leave me alone, Marion.
<s> All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
<s> Robbery's not criminal?
<s> I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
<s> You keep the ten thousand pounds.
<s> The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
<s> It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
<s> Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
<s> Who...
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
<s> That bitch? No.
<s> Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
<s> No.
<s> Right, that checks out here.
<s> I hope it's not the oven again.
<s> Key? Key? What is the key?
<s> Key?
<s> The key!
<s> We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
<s> Time to start talking.
<s> Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
<s> Energy shielding positive function.
<s> No.
<s> Hello, bomb.
<s> And I saw that I was alone.
<s> I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
<s> Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
<s> To explode, of course.
<s> I'll check it.
<s> Doolittle...
<s> I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
<s> Who cares?
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
<s> Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
<s> Not now!
<s> I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
<s> Ah... pity, pity...
<s> Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
<s> I like to keep it professional, that's all.
<s> But the boss knows I always been loyal.
<s> What the hell are you doing?
<s> No.
<s> You mean until you showed up?
<s> Police drone.
<s> Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
<s> Yech...
<s> And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
<s> First time I ever heard that.
<s> No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
<s> The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
<s> We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
<s> Can we go somewhere and talk?
<s> I won't be staying.
<s> Yes on all counts.
<s> Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
<s> Your help.
<s> She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
<s> Somebody's got to.
<s> Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
<s> Look, thank you for this but--
<s> And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
<s> Oh?
<s> Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
<s> I understand.
<s> Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
<s> You're crazy.
<s> Bastard...
<s> One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
<s> Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
<s> And because he's my friend.
<s> I'll bet you can.  Sit.
<s> I'm a toy to her.
<s> Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
<s> What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
<s> I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
<s> Yeah, a man's drink...
<s> You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
<s> Bye.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Disco blows dogs for quarters.
<s> Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
<s> Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
<s> No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
<s> Sure.
<s> It's my Bullworker.
<s> They're what?
<s> What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
<s> Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
<s> See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
<s> Go ahead, Jam.
<s> You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
<s> Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
<s> I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
<s> Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
<s> Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
<s> Not if I shoot first!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
<s> Not until like... eighth grade.
<s> I didn't say shit.
<s> What did you say?
<s> You'll know soon enough.
<s> I am so sorry.
<s> Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
<s> Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
<s> No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
<s> Why?
<s> Who?
<s> Maybe she's asleep.
<s> That is a terrible nickname.
<s> Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
<s> Grandma Death.
<s> I guess she just lost faith in the world.
<s> A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
<s> Why should we care?
<s> I don't own a television.
<s> Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think about girls a lot.
<s> It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
<s> But you were punished.
<s> Why?
<s> It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
<s> Soon. Time is almost up.
<s> Where is he, Donald?
<s> Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
<s> You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
<s> How did you know --
<s> What else?
<s> Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
<s> Go back to China, bitch!
<s> Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
<s> No more fuckin' for her.
<s> No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
<s> Oh-yah.
<s> Thank God for bunge cords.
<s> Okay.
<s> What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
<s> Airport Ho-Jo!
<s> Huh?
<s> Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
<s> I love you much.
<s> Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
<s> You heard me. Where is it?
<s> Yeah...
<s> Oh, naw. Hi.
<s> Loretta, shut it.
<s> Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
<s> All right, they're makin' a movie.
<s> Last year? It was, "Buy American."
<s> "Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
<s> A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
<s> Nothin' too showy!
<s> Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
<s> I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
<s> English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
<s> "My dear"...
<s> "My dear President"...
<s> I'll have to enclose the check first.
<s> Take a letter...
<s> None of your business...  Take another letter.
<s> Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
<s> I wanna powder my nose...
<s> All right -
<s> Yeh, he's only got one eye.
<s> You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
<s> Did you shoot the rapids?
<s> If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
<s> Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
<s> He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
<s> That's not bad for any day.
<s> Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
<s> That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
<s> Fine.  We gotta him. 
<s> So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
<s> This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
<s> Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
<s> Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
<s> Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
<s> Yes.
<s> Bah!! 
<s> I don't remember.
<s> No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
<s> He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
<s> All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
<s> But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
<s> WHAT  ?
<s> THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
<s> What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
<s> My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
<s> Two, please.
<s> Oh?
<s> I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
<s> Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
<s> All you do is profit from another man's misery!
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
<s> Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
<s> Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
<s> And what was that, John?
<s> Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
<s> Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
<s> Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
<s> Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
<s> Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
<s> It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
<s> Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good morning.
<s> I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
<s> My name is...
<s> Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
<s> Not at all, John.
<s> Yes, John.
<s> Fine.
<s> Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
<s> I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
<s> Yes. John wants it.
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
<s> There IS no one.
<s> You're losing your temper!
<s> PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
<s> What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
<s> "The fifth one this week"!
<s> Why?
<s> I... but I...
<s> There is something I must ask the Gods...
<s> Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
<s> REALLY?
<s> They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
<s> Yes?
<s> Don't talk nonsense.
<s> Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
<s> Sh!
<s> I didn't mean to!
<s> I don't know! I just did!
<s> I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
<s> We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
<s> Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
<s> But you're the Gods!
<s> Who gets killed?
<s> But how could he know... unless...
<s> I will join my grandfather there.
<s> It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
<s> Over the Edge of the World.
<s> Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
<s> That's it!
<s> What have you got there?
<s> Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
<s> It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
<s> That's right.
<s> Like you got rid of Snorri!
<s> I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
<s> It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
<s> I'm just building up to it, Dad.
<s> GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
<s> You liar!
<s> I'm not frightened... of anything...
<s> Yes, Mum.
<s> No, Mother.
<s> She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
<s> I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
<s> You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
<s> No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
<s> That's okay.
<s> You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
<s> I like to read.
<s> Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
<s> Very much.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
<s> No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
<s> No, it isn't that.
<s> No. Thanks.
<s> Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
<s> I don't know.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
<s> This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
<s> This is our first "date" date.
<s> Naomi, I guess.
<s> Egad, were you horrified?
<s> I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
<s> yeah?
<s> I think she's great.
<s> Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
<s> Um, no.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What if?
<s> That's okay. I --
<s> I'm nervous, too.
<s> Well, you obviously don't know me.
<s> I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
<s> God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
<s> Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
<s> Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
<s> Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
<s> I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
<s> I hope you get your work done.
<s> Yeah. Cool.
<s> Very cool. Trippy.
<s> What?
<s> This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
<s> Hi.
<s> They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
<s> I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
<s> I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
<s> December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
<s> Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
<s> Patrick, we need to focus.
<s> She was unconscious, Patrick.
<s> It's a quote book.
<s> Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
<s> The Clock People?
<s> Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
<s> Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
<s> So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
<s> Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
<s> Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
<s> Getting dressed. I've got to go.
<s> When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
<s> Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
<s> Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> Don't start with me, Cooper.
<s> You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
<s> I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
<s> It is not.
<s> You're okay now, it's over...
<s> We'll make it.
<s> "Another man?" Who?
<s> Pressure?
<s> His peritoneum has ruptured...
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
<s> That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
<s> Justin.
<s> Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
<s> Negative.
<s> I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
<s> What makes you think I'll miss?
<s> You know.
<s> I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
<s> Where is it?
<s> Smith, where the hell have you been?!
<s> Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
<s> Radiation interference?
<s> How much oh-two do we have?
<s> What about the life readings you picked up?
<s> No. It was someone else.
<s> Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
<s> "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
<s> What's going on in there, Starck?
<s> You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
<s> I did.
<s> Not according to the computer.
<s> It's cold.
<s> Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
<s> Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
<s> How?
<s> Do they have pressure?
<s> I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
<s> Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
<s> You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
<s> Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
<s> I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
<s> I wouldn't know anything about that.
<s> I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
<s> To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
<s> And you can? Power it up?
<s> I already got it. Everything I want.
<s> Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
<s> This makes five.
<s> Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
<s> Well maybe you should date him.
<s> Ben. Are you okay?
<s> Yeah, nine years straight.
<s> If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
<s> Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
<s> Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
<s> Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
<s> Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
<s> Go back to the drawing board.
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
<s> I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
<s> Ben! Ben!
<s> This place is deluxe. You got cable?
<s> Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<s> But all these people...
<s> Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I'm sure I can come up with something.
<s> You were?
<s> You need a doctor.
<s> He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
<s> Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
<s> Arnold. What's happening?
<s> I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
<s> Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
<s> It's the first door on your left!
<s> I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
<s> Your friends use the pool too.
<s> I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
<s> Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
<s> Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
<s> I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
<s> Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
<s> Dad says!
<s> So are you.  Are you shaking?
<s> All right, I take it back.
<s> All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
<s> You should work for yourself.
<s> Damone, you gotta listen to me.
<s> You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
<s> Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
<s> I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
<s> I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
<s> Naw. Any good?
<s> Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
<s> Do you think that guy's cute?
<s> Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
<s> It was nice.
<s> Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
<s> I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
<s> I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
<s> It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
<s> I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
<s> Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
<s> Yeah, like maybe never.
<s> Well I might go to Dartmouth.
<s> Yes.
<s> You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
<s> I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
<s> Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
<s> Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
<s> No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
<s> You're gonna flunk me?!
<s> Aloha, Spicoli.
<s> What about those other guys you live with?
<s> We keep them.
<s> I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
<s> Not at all.
<s> No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
<s> I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
<s> Do you really have to go?
<s> He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
<s> You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
<s> Awake? What do you mean?
<s> Naked.
<s> Naw! Not a major.
<s> This is my granddaughter...
<s> What?
<s> We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
<s> I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
<s> OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
<s> That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
<s> I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
<s> Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
<s> There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
<s> Plans?
<s> I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
<s> That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
<s> Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
<s> They were all veterans.
<s> Right!
<s> Nobody. I'm the maid!
<s> Of course, officer.
<s> I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
<s> Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
<s> You and a lot of other people.
<s> They'll be back.
<s> Nah, I got the gun.
<s> Gonna stay for a couple?
<s> C'mon guys--
<s> Come on, come on.
<s> Shit!
<s> What?
<s> We lived near power lines.
<s> Anyone else?
<s> Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
<s> You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
<s> The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
<s> What the hell's going on here!?
<s> Clear!
<s> Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
<s> Move slow and move quiet.
<s> Get something on that.
<s> Wait God-dammit!
<s> All right.
<s> I'm not lying.
<s> I just hit it like you said.
<s> So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
<s> I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
<s> Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
<s> Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
<s> Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
<s> God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
<s> Dick, we need some time apart --
<s> What night?
<s> Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
<s> Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
<s> I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
<s> Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
<s> But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
<s> Are you really serious? About acting?
<s> Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
<s> Yeah, well --
<s> Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
<s> Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
<s> I guess.
<s> Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
<s> Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
<s> Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
<s> Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
<s> Yes.
<s> What'd you do?
<s> Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
<s> Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
<s> You kill me, Mama.
<s> Mama...?
<s> You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
<s> I'm going out!
<s> I will, I promise.
<s> But what -- 
<s> Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
<s> Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
<s> Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
<s> You didn't say 'Symington says'.
<s> Yes. It was very good to see her.
<s> Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
<s> You speak.
<s> I see it before me.
<s> Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
<s> SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
<s> Quite right!
<s> He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
<s> It's far too late for him to still be out.
<s> It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
<s> Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
<s> Quite a send-off, isn't it?
<s> Only you.
<s> Not as weak as I.
<s> Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
<s> I have been waiting for this ever since.
<s> Oh God.
<s> Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
<s> Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
<s> You're a comfort to me, Henry.
<s> These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
<s> That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
<s> Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
<s> No. They don't.
<s> Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
<s> Madness?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
<s> I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
<s> Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
<s> They're off now.
<s> I can't, Barry...
<s> Somebody'll see.
<s> Where'd you get that stuff?
<s> Here we go.
<s> Get behind him more.
<s> God, but I love that sexy talk.
<s> Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
<s> Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
<s> I love you.
<s> Ned!
<s> I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
<s> I call it my shower dream.
<s> Those things can be nasty.
<s> But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
<s> No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
<s> I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
<s> Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
<s> Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
<s> Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
<s> Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
<s> I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
<s> It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
<s> Thank you, son.
<s> Come again?
<s> Sorry, I need everybody.
<s> My wife.
<s> In heaven.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
<s> No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
<s> Forever together.
<s> Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
<s> You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
<s> Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
<s> If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
<s> You asked me if I would --
<s> Okay.
<s> Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
<s> Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
<s> Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
<s> He signaled the Ranger.
<s> Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
<s> What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
<s> That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
<s> These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
<s> Seth, if you were me --
<s> What?
<s> I did?
<s> It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
<s> Where are you right now?
<s> Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
<s> Same rules for everyone, sir.
<s> So I'll get a fair shot?
<s> Motherachrist...
<s> O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
<s> Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
<s> Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
<s> Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
<s> I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
<s> Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
<s> I oughtta report you.
<s> You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
<s> I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
<s> Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
<s> Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
<s> Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
<s> I saw an article...
<s> Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
<s> Well, now I feel so much better.
<s> You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
<s> Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
<s> How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
<s> Maybe half.  Not even.
<s> Should I be afraid?
<s> Wasn't deemed a threat.
<s> Darth Vader reads poetry...
<s> O'Neil, Jordan.
<s> I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
<s> All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
<s> We know, Audrey.
<s> Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
<s> I got pretty close.
<s> I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
<s> Nesting?
<s> I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
<s> Oh my God! They're coming!
<s> Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Allez, allez!
<s> Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
<s> You're fast.
<s> Get your people out of there or I will.
<s> It's Tatopoulos.
<s> No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
<s> What are you suggesting?
<s> We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
<s> You don't have the authority to do that.
<s> Oh.
<s> Why do you need that?
<s> I am not permitted to speak of such things.
<s> It's Raymond.
<s> Is that the bathroom?
<s> Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
<s> That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
<s> No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
<s> You think you could do better "Laredo?"
<s> Dear God.... How did I come to this?
<s> Could they be the miners?
<s> Nobody was WATCHING?
<s> It's okay. Listen-
<s> It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
<s> Yes Commander?
<s> Okay, now. But-
<s> Yes?
<s> All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
<s> You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
<s> It's ... incredible.
<s> We're doing episode 31, Jason?
<s> Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
<s> BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
<s> Not a clue. You?
<s> You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
<s> We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
<s> Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
<s> It helps.
<s> Almost as much as he loves himself.
<s> I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
<s> Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
<s> Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
<s> Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
<s> Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
<s> Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
<s> NO, Thank God he has not.
<s> It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
<s> But there it is!...
<s> But...Why?
<s> It doesn't have eyes.
<s> Pedal to the metal...
<s> They always say that.
<s> What does she see in them?
<s> You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
<s> But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
<s> Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
<s> I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
<s> Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
<s> Yes, general?
<s> No, my lord.
<s> Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
<s> Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
<s> Then use rocks!
<s> No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
<s> But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
<s> Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
<s> I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
<s> Who's in command out there?
<s> It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
<s> A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
<s> I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
<s> They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
<s> Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
<s> What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
<s> Uh... none just now, but...
<s> Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
<s> But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
<s> That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
<s> Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
<s> Some things must never change.
<s> Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
<s> Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
<s> That's a lie!
<s> Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
<s> I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
<s> Sally, our slave system is a British law...
<s> That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
<s> The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
<s> Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
<s> That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
<s> You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
<s> I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
<s> Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
<s> No. What's this?
<s> Your who?
<s> I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
<s> That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
<s> With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
<s> What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
<s> Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
<s> You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
<s> Who is this?
<s> Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
<s> Where you been, Harry?
<s> Harry, lemme give you some advice.
<s> I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
<s> Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
<s> I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
<s> I said I had an idea, that's all.
<s> A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
<s> I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
<s> You have it?
<s> Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
<s> He died.
<s> Personally?
<s> Twenty seven hundred.
<s> You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
<s> You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
<s> Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
<s> That's right. Three percent.
<s> A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
<s> How much is the wife offered?
<s> I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
<s> Don't go out of your way.
<s> Sounds fair.
<s> Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
<s> Oh.
<s> Hey, Chili? Look at me.
<s> You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
<s> Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
<s> You seem to feel fine about it.
<s> Harry -
<s> Oh, yeah, sure.
<s> He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
<s> Hello, Martin.
<s> Really.
<s> North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
<s> I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
<s> That's what it says.
<s> We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
<s> I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
<s> What?
<s> Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
<s> Maybe he isn't alone.
<s> Seen a lota movies.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
<s> What, you think there's something funny about it?
<s> Then it happened before they scuttled her.
<s> So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
<s> Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
<s> I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
<s> Right.
<s> Maybe you can tell me then.
<s> Don't lie to me!
<s> If money can buy what he wants.
<s> I bet you did.
<s> Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
<s> You're a pal.
<s> Lights?
<s> Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
<s> No cowboy shit. Right.
<s> Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
<s> I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> What?
<s> February first.
<s> I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
<s> I don't know, are we?
<s> Not our mystery guest again.
<s> We could call for help.
<s> Maybe.
<s> You don't remember?
<s> You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
<s> You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
<s> It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
<s> Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
<s> What is it now?
<s> Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
<s> I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
<s> Well, yes...
<s> Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
<s> What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
<s> Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
<s> It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
<s> SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
<s> Can I come in?
<s> I guess.
<s> That's just the way I am!
<s> Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
<s> Hey Josh.
<s> I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
<s> Uh oh... don't turn around...
<s> Good.
<s> You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
<s> Okay, okay!
<s> God, it's so totally pathetic.
<s> You loser!
<s> God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
<s> God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
<s> We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
<s> I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> I'm going to tell him you said that.
<s> I can't believe it!
<s> Totally! Look!
<s> Bingo!
<s> It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
<s> Somewhere downtown.
<s> What, is she black now?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
<s> It's always closed...
<s> As always.
<s> I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
<s> Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
<s> Everybody's too stupid!
<s> Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
<s> Wait...
<s> Where?
<s> You cunt!
<s> I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
<s> No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
<s> I can't imagine spending money on towels.
<s> You're insane.
<s> He came into work.
<s> I need to talk to you.
<s> Shhh!
<s> Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
<s> You don't know what you're talking about.
<s> You're late, asshole.
<s> Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
<s> God, fuck you!
<s> Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
<s> Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
<s> I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
<s> Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
<s> Oh my god! We have to go in here!
<s> Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
<s> I'm not holding my breath in that department.
<s> Just wait here.
<s> Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
<s> Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
<s> Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Why?
<s> Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
<s> ...I better not...
<s> So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
<s> Can you at least let me in?
<s> Do you have anything to drink?
<s> What about this?
<s> FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
<s> So where would we go?
<s> What do you want?
<s> They're Seymour's.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
<s> Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
<s> Why? What did she tell you?
<s> -malaria epidemic; very sudden.
<s> You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
<s> How could it be? I hate Africa.
<s> Don't they, though?
<s> All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
<s> Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
<s> You never had it.
<s> Then we agree. 
<s> Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
<s> Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
<s> -you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
<s> What did I do?
<s> It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
<s> But of course yours worked.
<s> Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
<s> I have to ask- why do you need me?
<s> Once... 
<s> I don't believe you had a mother. 
<s> Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
<s> I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
<s> Certainly.
<s> I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
<s> I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
<s> Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
<s> We definitely had a moment or two.
<s> I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
<s> Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
<s> Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
<s> What are you doing up here?
<s> Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
<s> How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
<s> Too bad for the Moldavians.
<s> Yes, the scourge --
<s> -- the sorrow --
<s> Maybe they just want to appeal.
<s> Did I forget something?
<s> I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
<s> This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
<s> Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
<s> I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
<s> I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
<s> His nickname is "The Hammer."
<s> It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
<s> And we're the ...
<s> This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
<s> That's it.  It's on the bottom.
<s> Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
<s> I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
<s> No, the slime is rising.
<s> It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
<s> I'll get one more reading.
<s> We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
<s> Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
<s> We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
<s> Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
<s> Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
<s> Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
<s> Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
<s> Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
<s> Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
<s> So what do you think it was?
<s> What?
<s> Are you all right?
<s> This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
<s> I'll scream.
<s> Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
<s> I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
<s> I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
<s> Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
<s> He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
<s> One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
<s> We'll get back to you.
<s> Here are tonight's calls.
<s> The EPA?  What's he want?
<s> Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
<s> Did you ever report it to anyone?
<s> Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
<s> No, you may not.
<s> The magic word is "please."
<s> Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
<s> Close -- but definitely wrong.
<s> They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
<s> When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
<s> She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
<s> Yeah, I can smell it.
<s> What do you mean "bad?"
<s> I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
<s> Life is just a state of mind.
<s> Neutronize.  System shut.
<s> I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
<s> Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
<s> It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
<s> I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
<s> Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
<s> It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
<s> No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
<s> Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
<s> Mmmhmmm.
<s> Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
<s> Not yet, dear brother...
<s> You flatter me, Caesar.
<s> Caesar?
<s> On what charge?
<s> Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
<s> I wouldn't know who to bet on.
<s> Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
<s> Yes, Caesar.
<s> This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
<s> I'll nose around...
<s> When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
<s> He killed his father and then my family...
<s> My troops don't make policy.
<s> I can't let you do that.
<s> How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
<s> General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
<s> I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
<s> So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
<s> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
<s> Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
<s> Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
<s> I'm sorry I took you in there.
<s> But, Elaine --
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
<s> Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
<s> I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
<s> It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
<s> During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
<s> Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
<s> That woman --
<s> That woman. The older woman.
<s> No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
<s> Because -- I am.
<s> Elaine -- I love you.
<s> What did she say?
<s> Then what?
<s> All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
<s> -- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
<s> Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> I have to go back now.
<s> Yes.
<s> Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
<s> Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
<s> I'm in the bathroom.
<s> The Singleman party, sir?
<s> Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
<s> It's down the hall.
<s> No.
<s> That's right.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> But it's light in there now.
<s> Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
<s> I'm very neurotic.
<s> Pardon?
<s> I know that. But I'm --
<s> Is that what you're trying to tell me?
<s> Let me out!
<s> Oh. Hello. Hello.
<s> A drink? Of course.
<s> Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
<s> Isn't there something you want to tell me?
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
<s> No.
<s> There!
<s> Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
<s> The driveway's on my side of the house.
<s> What?
<s> We don't.
<s> Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
<s> I don't.
<s> Think real hard, Benjamin.
<s> All right. Now let's get to bed.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Art.
<s> Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
<s> Then give me your word you won't.
<s> Promise me, Benjamin.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> -- worried?
<s> What about it?
<s> That has nothing to do with it --
<s> No. She doesn't know about it.
<s> No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
<s> Ben -- how old are you now?
<s> I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
<s> Oh no.
<s> Don't shout at me, Ben.
<s> Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
<s> That what he says. Right?
<s> Yes.
<s> I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
<s> You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
<s> You might find a bullet through that head...
<s> That.
<s> Oh -- work!!
<s> Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
<s> Will you do me a big favor?
<s> Yes --
<s> For tonight. 
<s> Why do you hide in my room?
<s> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
<s> I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
<s> No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
<s> I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
<s> Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
<s> Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
<s> I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
<s> Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
<s> No?
<s> Don't.
<s> General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
<s> Yes, quite.
<s> In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
<s> A little strange, Baron.
<s> I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
<s> I must have made a mistake.
<s> No, Doctor.
<s> Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
<s> Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
<s> Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
<s> Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
<s> Yes --
<s> Money!
<s> Later?
<s> Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
<s> Movies?
<s> Perhaps. 
<s> Well -- you want me?
<s> Well?
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Well, he's a gentleman!
<s> Why not?
<s> Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
<s> We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
<s> I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
<s> Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
<s> We did not approach you.
<s> He likes to play the great man.
<s> Ah, come on -- we're going home.
<s> It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
<s> The house is not full -- Is it really full?
<s> Good morning, Gru -- your --
<s> Me?
<s> Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
<s> The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
<s> No news yet?
<s> Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
<s> I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
<s> He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
<s> Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
<s> Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
<s> Roy? He's always crying.
<s> No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
<s> Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
<s> Goody!
<s> So here we are!
<s> Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
<s> One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
<s> Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
<s> Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
<s> Why? What's wrong?
<s> That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
<s> Perk.
<s> Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
<s> Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
<s> Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
<s> I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
<s> Never.
<s> I don't?
<s> Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
<s> I want to know everything about you.
<s> Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
<s> I went out to Delmar.
<s> Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
<s> But the setup's there. It's there now.
<s> Gun?
<s> We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
<s> Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
<s> ... I think it would be best if you both left.
<s> Nothing's missing?
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> I was trying to get away from someone.
<s> Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Just get on the bus.
<s> John...
<s> Where'd you get it?
<s> Can I come in?
<s> Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
<s> You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
<s> Looks great.  It does.
<s> Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
<s> We've got to get these kids out of here...
<s> You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
<s> You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
<s> I thought you were allergic to latex.
<s> Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
<s> Why?  You interested?
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> Guess so ...
<s> He says things.  Bad things.
<s> Danny!!!
<s> It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
<s> Kara, no!
<s> Stay away, Sam.
<s> Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
<s> No!!!
<s> It's a bitch.
<s> One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
<s> Used to be against the law, didn't it?
<s> You know what gets me?
<s> Tell them yourself!
<s> Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
<s> I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
<s> Sorry.
<s> It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
<s> He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
<s> You're an imbecile.
<s> I've considered that.
<s> Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
<s> To make an ass of yourself.
<s> Out!  Out!
<s> Thank God!
<s> She met him at college.
<s> What's good about that?
<s> England?
<s> Tell me that.
<s> Go on.
<s> Mhravitch.
<s> She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
<s> I can't take my eyes off you.
<s> Can't it keep till morning?
<s> Damn.
<s> The smallest thing I've got.
<s> Leave a tip.
<s> It's your house, Dad.
<s> I'm talking to you gently now.
<s> Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
<s> We thought a doctor might help.
<s> He's a very decent man, Harold.
<s> I could carve a better man out of a banana!
<s> Say hello to your mother.
<s> Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
<s> It's so--so stark.
<s> Turn around?
<s> You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
<s> Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
<s> That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
<s> It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
<s> Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sneaking in the back door.
<s> If he wants to go.
<s> I see.
<s> He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
<s> It seems highly intelligent to me.
<s> Like what?
<s> I'm teaching my son to be a man.
<s> What a handsome word.
<s> May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
<s> Load it for her.
<s> Ooops.
<s> We'll miss you so.
<s> And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
<s> She still has just the one child-- the boy?
<s> We'll find out now, won't we?
<s> Oooooo.  That hurt.
<s> We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
<s> I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
<s> Get up.
<s> It's trash now, like mine.
<s> Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
<s> For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
<s> You don't know?
<s> So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
<s> Yes.
<s> Ja?
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
<s> Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
<s> Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
<s> All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
<s> If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
<s> A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
<s> Still lives with his mother.
<s> I was afraid to ask.
<s> Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Far as I know.
<s> Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
<s> He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
<s> I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
<s> He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
<s> Take plenty of cigars.
<s> No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
<s> It's a jungle out there.
<s> Not true.
<s> What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
<s> Yes, we do.
<s> You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
<s> There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
<s> We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
<s> The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
<s> Yeah, yeah...
<s> Overpowering?
<s> Too bad. I wasn't in it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Um-hm. Live sound.
<s> Last I heard he went to San Diego.
<s> You don't understand shit.
<s> No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
<s> You used to work at Copper Penny?
<s> It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
<s> Fuck.
<s> Why can't I meet him now?
<s> But what?
<s> Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
<s> Well, what do they know?
<s> Yeah.
<s> What have you found out?
<s> They are?
<s> Hmm.
<s> Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
<s> That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
<s> It was called 'Slave of Love.'
<s> I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
<s> Where!
<s> I want to meet Ratan.
<s> I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
<s> Is this with a girl named Kristen?
<s> I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
<s> That's all right.
<s> My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
<s> Film making can be pretty expensive...
<s> Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
<s> Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
<s> What do you think of that? Or this?
<s> He asked me. You going with anybody?
<s> You ever play Chicken?
<s> Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
<s> No.
<s> Oh, I don't have one.
<s> I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
<s> I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
<s> Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
<s> Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
<s> I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
<s> I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
<s> Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
<s> I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
<s> You're welcome.  Did you know him?
<s> Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
<s> That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
<s> Because they are all the same.
<s> Well...
<s> Over there by the courthouse.
<s> That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
<s> But we can't just dig it up!
<s> Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
<s> Well, I don't...
<s> Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes. It's almost there.
<s> Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
<s> Maude.
<s> I took them out.
<s> Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
<s> Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
<s> Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
<s> But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
<s> Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
<s> Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
<s> Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
<s> No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
<s> Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
<s> Ah, yes.
<s> I go to funerals.
<s> Well, maybe one.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Souvenirs?
<s> Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
<s> Eh, yes, ma'm.
<s> Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
<s> Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
<s> Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
<s> I know.
<s> It certainly is.
<s> I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
<s> What?
<s> WHY?
<s> No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
<s> You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
<s> What are you talking about? Who are you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
<s> Story of my life.
<s> I'm lucky that way.
<s> Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
<s> Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
<s> From where??!!
<s> I thought you liked being on TV.
<s> I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
<s> How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
<s> "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
<s> Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
<s> Agent Myers is your new liaison.
<s> This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
<s> Don't move. We --
<s> Shh! Just a second.
<s> Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
<s> What -- ?
<s> Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
<s> No!
<s> No.
<s> Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
<s> Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
<s> I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
<s> I'm very happy.
<s> Tell me who you are.
<s> Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
<s> His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
<s> You're hurting.
<s> What?
<s> So you were cheated.
<s> Hi. I got soaked.
<s> Which is where?
<s> The best part of ten years.
<s> He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
<s> I don't know where to begin...
<s> Well come over, will you? See the place?
<s> Maybe you should give it some time.
<s> Sure.
<s> No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
<s> Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
<s> Are you alright ?
<s> I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
<s> Just trying to get my apartment in order.
<s> Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
<s> I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
<s> -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
<s> To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
<s> Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
<s> Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
<s> But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
<s> Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
<s> No way.
<s> So?  You even said they're good.
<s> No.  We need the gig.
<s> We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
<s> No, you can't.
<s> They always seemed...
<s> Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
<s> Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
<s> Uh...yes, at the moment.
<s> Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
<s> There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
<s> Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
<s> I want a tape.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
<s> It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
<s> -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
<s> -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
<s> Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
<s> You really believe that?
<s> Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
<s> So we have a chance of getting back together again.
<s> Fine.  One.
<s> You really think it would make a difference either way?
<s> Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
<s> That bad, eh?
<s> Hey, how ya doin'?
<s> Pigsty.
<s> It'll have to be sex, then.
<s> I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
<s> Okay.
<s> You're being stupid.
<s> That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
<s> Not really.
<s> Not in love, exactly, but...
<s> I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
<s> No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
<s> Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
<s> Thank you.
<s> That way.  You?
<s> Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
<s> Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
<s> I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
<s> Then what are you getting so upset about?
<s> Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
<s> Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
<s> Sixty.
<s> And I won't take a penny over ninety.
<s> I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
<s> Sure.  Ten cents.
<s> No, we...
<s> This one came unassembled.
<s> Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
<s> I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
<s> There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
<s> Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
<s> I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
<s> Where?
<s> Are you?
<s> You've been listening to rumors.
<s> I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
<s> Yes.
<s> Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
<s> Will I see you again?
<s> I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
<s> Spare me the details.
<s> Never take up poker, Detective.
<s> You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
<s> Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
<s> And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
<s> First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> You're a long way from Inverness.
<s> I don't know why.
<s> You will live.  Survive.
<s> Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
<s> It's like to kill me first.
<s> And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
<s> If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
<s> I feel hardly nothing.
<s> I have no future husband.
<s> But I did live.
<s> So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
<s> Who?
<s> I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
<s> Mulet.
<s> Second musketeer.
<s> And the Bulgarian?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
<s> I've had a few more concerns.
<s> And if I refuse?
<s> Where were you Tuesday night?
<s> I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
<s> But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
<s> The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
<s> I'm sure that's true.
<s> A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
<s> It doesn't have to rhyme!
<s> It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
<s> I'm sure you haven't any.
<s> Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
<s> Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
<s> The Criminal Courts Building.
<s> Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
<s> No. My mother.
<s> I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
<s> You haven't seen anything yet.
<s> Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
<s> Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
<s> The money? Why?
<s> Gee! Take a look, will you?
<s> Your luck's not with you now!
<s> Out of the mouths of babes.
<s> Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
<s> You -- you --
<s> Keep away --
<s> I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
<s> I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> Thanks.
<s> His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
<s> Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
<s> I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
<s> We're not interested.
<s> Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
<s> Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
<s> What did you do with her?
<s> You been in a fight?
<s> Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
<s> Come here. See if we can move it.
<s> What is it? Here!
<s> Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
<s> All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
<s> A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
<s> What would you do if it was a daughter?
<s> Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
<s> You know you did!
<s> Take that mush out of your mouth!
<s> I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
<s> I think it is.
<s> I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
<s> It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
<s> The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
<s> In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
<s> All right -- all right!
<s> What have you got, Hildy?
<s> Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
<s> I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
<s> What?
<s> The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
<s> Yeah. But I --
<s> Fred!
<s> We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
<s> Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
<s> I did.  Hold the wire.
<s> I was just going to!
<s> I can't.
<s> Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
<s> I thought so, too.
<s> First you got to sign a receipt. 
<s> Thanks. So long, Hildy!
<s> You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
<s> I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
<s> You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
<s> Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
<s> I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
<s> Shut up, you!
<s> Who do you think!
<s> No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
<s> All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
<s> A very fine-looking women.
<s> She and Mollie were talking.
<s> No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
<s> I don't mind.
<s> Yes.
<s> Ask her yourself.
<s> Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
<s> It's like telling fibs.
<s> They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
<s> A bit too quick.
<s> Please yourself.
<s> Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
<s> What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
<s> Weeds will grow, Mac.
<s> Kiss me Hardy.
<s> Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
<s> You taste it.
<s> A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
<s> This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
<s> Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
<s> The ideas you get in your head.
<s> No, I won't.
<s> Who said anything about love?
<s> Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
<s> Up to six weeks, I think.
<s> Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
<s> Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
<s> You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
<s> I know you mean well.
<s> I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
<s> Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
<s> What about R.J.?
<s> Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
<s> No, I told you...
<s> Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
<s> Yeah, come on.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
<s> Fucking great.
<s> I don't drive cross country.
<s> I don't.
<s> Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
<s> I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
<s> Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
<s> I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What's that?
<s> Cat fight, cat fight.
<s> Turn that fucking radio off!
<s> Just sit back and enjoy the show.
<s> Hmmmmmmmmm?
<s> Hmmmmm.
<s> Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
<s> Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
<s> Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
<s> I hear ya.
<s> Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
<s> That's nice.
<s> Oh.
<s> It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
<s> Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
<s> I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
<s> No please, let me sit this one out.
<s> Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
<s> I can't believe...
<s> I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
<s> Keys.
<s> Firefly.
<s> Oh, you mean on TV.
<s> No, just a little too old.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
<s> Wait, I want to say good-bye.
<s> Well, go get her.
<s> No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
<s> Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
<s> Call the chief... We found 'em.
<s> Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
<s> That is the wrong fork, young man.
<s> Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Of course not.
<s> No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
<s> I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
<s> You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
<s> Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
<s> Okay.
<s> It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
<s> What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
<s> I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
<s> Oh, Rosie.
<s> No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
<s> I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
<s> No biggie.
<s> Yes, and...
<s> I'll be out in a minute.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> What?
<s> Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
<s> Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
<s> ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
<s> Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
<s> Have you?
<s> Really?
<s> Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
<s> Ugnh.
<s> Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
<s> Even better.
<s> Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
<s> I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
<s> Yep.
<s> Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
<s> Do we need words?
<s> For whom and for what?
<s> No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
<s> It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
<s> The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
<s> What did he say?
<s> You being cute?
<s> Yeah. Sure, sure.
<s> I got drunk.
<s> So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
<s> Thanks for the drink.
<s> Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
<s> It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
<s> Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
<s> You want me to tell her for you?
<s> If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
<s> Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
<s> You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
<s> Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
<s> What for? To play Fats again?
<s> Glad to meet you.
<s> Would you like to come out tonight?
<s> Ten dollars.
<s> Yes.
<s> Eight o'clock.
<s> Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
<s> Fair.
<s> Then why go to the bus station?
<s> Around.
<s> I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
<s> At school. It's Thursday.
<s> Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
<s> When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
<s> The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
<s> I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
<s> I love you.
<s> Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
<s> Nothin'.  Want another drink?
<s> Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
<s> More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
<s> I'll be up later.
<s> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
<s> Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
<s> You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
<s> Thousand dollars a game.
<s> You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
<s> Have you always had it?
<s> What's inside?
<s> Yes.
<s> Virginia...?
<s> It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
<s> Because the sky is so clear out here.
<s> Okay.
<s> You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
<s> Sure ... fine.
<s> That's a doozy of a dream, son.
<s> It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
<s> I'll take you to school.
<s> Why, yes.  Why?
<s> May I ask why?
<s> About what?
<s> I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
<s> You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
<s> Yes.
<s> 'Cause he wouldn't lie.
<s> Who are you calling?
<s> This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
<s> Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
<s> Punched the President? Oh my god.
<s> Then get them out of there.
<s> It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
<s> College nickname.
<s> It's perfect the line is busy?
<s> He wasn't the President then.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> It's not me. They're overriding the system.
<s> I had a feeling you would.
<s> And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
<s> I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
<s> That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
<s> My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
<s> It had been deemed classified.
<s> Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
<s> It's... slowing down, Sir.
<s> He's doing a good job.
<s> Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
<s> Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
<s> I'm a dancer.
<s> How to kiss ass.
<s> It's all fuzzy.
<s> Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
<s> Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Yes.
<s> Here... now.
<s> Peace? No peace.
<s> There is no museum in Iskenderun.
<s> Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
<s> Arghhh! Oh!
<s> What?
<s> I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
<s> Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
<s> The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
<s> Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
<s> You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
<s> He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
<s> Don't know. Think of something.
<s> Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
<s> Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
<s> Will you take it easy!
<s> Don't worry. He won't.
<s> You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
<s> You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
<s> What about Marcus?
<s> Relax.
<s> That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
<s> I don't know. We'll find out.
<s> Fly... yes. Land... no.
<s> What happens at eleven o'clock?
<s> More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
<s> Who are you?
<s> I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
<s> If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
<s> You should have been there...
<s> Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
<s> When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
<s> Yeah, that's what happened...
<s> "Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
<s> Why they glow like that?
<s> Two are still missing.
<s> Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
<s> No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
<s> He told me they knew I was coming here.
<s> Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
<s> Keep stroking it!
<s> I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
<s> He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
<s> No -- real food.
<s> Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
<s> You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
<s> You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
<s> I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
<s> I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
<s> What above the curves?!
<s> Willie, come on!
<s> I know you did!
<s> That a new Datsun?
<s> You said it.
<s> Yep.
<s> Who was that? Somebody out there?
<s> Too late...They want you.
<s> Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
<s> They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
<s> You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
<s> Just scratched my arm, why?
<s> Send a man there. A secret agent.
<s> You eat it.
<s> Where are you going? Wait!
<s> Don't just stand there, say something.
<s> ...Rene...
<s> Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
<s> But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
<s> What are you looking at?
<s> This...is not going to work out.
<s> Not blue enough.
<s> She's the toughest to read.
<s> Not her. You!
<s> It's not your time. I get time off.
<s> We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
<s> Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
<s> It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
<s> I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
<s> Too late.
<s> He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
<s> Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
<s> About what?
<s> Now, you're too suspicious.
<s> You've changed your mind.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> You're lovely.
<s> It's all we've got.
<s> It'll remind me of you.
<s> I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
<s> I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
<s> No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
<s> I dyed it. We're all getting old.
<s> We met on the beach.
<s> He's not an ordinary man.
<s> That name's familiar.
<s> What?
<s> Not you. Them.
<s> I don't know Who.
<s> Been complaning of hallucinations.
<s> Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
<s> You...him...UST.
<s> Nothing.
<s> ...I'm looking for someone.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
<s> You did.
<s> They left. I had to go with them.
<s> You seemed interesting.
<s> No.
<s> He must be a good friend.
<s> What is it?
<s> Beats me.
<s> Get us one.
<s> He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
<s> ...across THE BORDER. Come on!
<s> You've  been there?
<s> This going to work?
<s> He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
<s> Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
<s> Why did you, then?
<s> You're gonna laugh.
<s> Her?
<s> You are, I've seen you.
<s> It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
<s> Why'd you invite me here?
<s> What about the others.
<s> Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
<s> It'l be alright.
<s> It doesn't hurt.
<s> Poor bastard.
<s> Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
<s> Sure. Where?
<s> It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
<s> Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
<s> Yeah. Catch you later.
<s> Lunch?
<s> No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
<s> I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
<s> Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
<s> What about you, you got a crew already?
<s> Okay. 
<s> How grave?
<s> Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
<s> How are you, Jim?
<s> That's my stuff from the office...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
<s> I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
<s> They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
<s> Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
<s> You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
<s> What I've seen... I've liked.
<s> How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
<s> It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
<s> Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
<s> I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
<s> No.
<s> You believe that?
<s> Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
<s> I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
<s> I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
<s> She sued you for back payments of child support?
<s> What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
<s> What does this have to do with my testimony?
<s> I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
<s> She's okay.
<s> What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
<s> Where you staying now?
<s> Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
<s> You're gonna get your fix...
<s> And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
<s> And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
<s> It acts as a drug on the body?
<s> He --
<s> After you, Doll.
<s> Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
<s> Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
<s> No...
<s> Triple!
<s> I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
<s> Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
<s> It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
<s> Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
<s> The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
<s> Thanks, buddy.
<s> You have the pre-nup?
<s> What do you mean, was.
<s> That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
<s> Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
<s> He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
<s> Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
<s> But you don't agree?
<s> You don't believe in it.
<s> Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
<s> Miles?
<s> I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
<s> Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
<s> Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
<s> Yes, Miles. I accept.
<s> Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
<s> Oh Miles!
<s> I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
<s> In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
<s> Fabric and fringe.
<s> I love you. I want to have your baby.
<s> The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
<s> It's not something I wanted either.
<s> Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
<s> Murder?
<s> But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
<s> Marylin?
<s> Dogs?
<s> Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
<s> Jesus.
<s> He was right, wasn't he?
<s> She did a Harriman.
<s> He has a reputation for being tough.
<s> So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
<s> It's not Ming. It's Tong.
<s> I guess.
<s> He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
<s> Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
<s> I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
<s> What are they?
<s> HA!
<s> Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
<s> We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
<s> Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
<s> What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
<s> That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
<s> Yes, I knowbut
<s> I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
<s> Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
<s> South America.
<s> In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
<s> You're going to finance him, I suppose.
<s> On the road.
<s> He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
<s> Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
<s> Sock her!
<s> . . . turn."
<s> Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
<s> Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
<s> Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
<s> Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
<s> Why, you ungrateful brat!
<s> Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
<s> Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
<s> What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
<s> I can't go out like this.
<s> Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
<s> I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
<s> Next week "East Lynne."
<s> You always want to run everything.
<s> At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
<s> We're not going to sleep out here, are we?

<s> Try me.
<s> Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Amazing.
<s> Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
<s> Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
<s> Come here, you little fool!
<s> Whome?  Want to see me?
<s> Do you know?
<s> Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
<s> It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
<s> Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
<s> Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
<s> That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
<s> Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
<s> Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
<s> I dunno.
<s> "Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
<s> Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
<s> Yeah. Come oncome on!
<s> You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
<s> You're not kidnapping her, are you?
<s> My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
<s> Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
<s> Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
<s> Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
<s> Keep saying what?
<s> The anonymous kind, Chief.
<s> At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
<s> Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
<s> I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
<s> Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
<s> Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
<s> No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
<s> Calm down, Dave, what?
<s> Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
<s> Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
<s> They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
<s> And then Sunday?
<s> Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
<s> Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
<s> Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
<s> Hi, Freckle Face.
<s> There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
<s> Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
<s> I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
<s> The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
<s> Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
<s> No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
<s> A Willie O'Keefe?
<s> Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
<s> It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
<s> Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
<s> I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
<s> Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
<s> Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
<s> Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
<s> Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
<s> It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
<s> Tough day.
<s> Your daughter's life was just threatened!
<s> You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
<s> Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
<s> I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
<s> Huh?
<s> Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
<s> He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
<s> Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
<s> What are you driving at, boss?
<s> Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
<s> I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
<s> Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
<s> Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
<s> Allen Dulles?
<s> They're gonna love you, chief.
<s> Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
<s> Yes.
<s> You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
<s> I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
<s> ...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
<s> Never touched me.
<s> Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
<s> Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
<s> The assassination, Jack?
<s> Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
<s> Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
<s> And what would I have to do?
<s> Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
<s> Oh, that's not a problem.
<s> Who was there for your ass?
<s> I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
<s> You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
<s> She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
<s> I thought you might want a drink?
<s> Cash poor?
<s> Bigger?
<s> I'm old enough to be her father.
<s> I don't care.
<s> Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
<s> He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
<s> What if I've figured a way?
<s> That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
<s> People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
<s> What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
<s> I hesitated taking that much.
<s> Thanks, but you have a good time.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> You know what's in the bag you're taking?
<s> Can I smoke?
<s> I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
<s> I thought you were going to let this one through.
<s> Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
<s> What's her story?
<s> And splittin' with her?
<s> She told you that?
<s> I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
<s> She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
<s> What about me?
<s> Buy ya a beer?
<s> Great...  ...Wanda!
<s> This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
<s> That coke was yours, wasn't it?
<s> One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
<s> All your money's in Mexico.
<s> The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
<s> I told them.
<s> They already know it's you.
<s> I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
<s> Managers get ten percent.
<s> I'll give ya ten.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
<s> I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
<s> I can sit through it once.
<s> I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
<s> Sure.
<s> Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
<s> What's your cost?
<s> Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
<s> Okay.
<s> You're outside?
<s> Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
<s> Sure.
<s> I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
<s> Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
<s> Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
<s> Not now, pick me up.
<s> You know how she is.
<s> In the chest and stomach.
<s> What?
<s> It's in there.
<s> Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
<s> Have fun.
<s> Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
<s> House.
<s> I thought you might be asleep.
<s> That I gotta see.
<s> We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
<s> Where do you want to go?
<s> No! Oh God.
<s> No, don't. But thanks.
<s> Me, too.
<s> He was upset. He thought people were following him.
<s> Tell your mother.
<s> Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
<s> Used you?
<s> I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
<s> We should get ourselves a lawyer.
<s> I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
<s> If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
<s> I know.
<s> See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> Your back? Did you fall?
<s> We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
<s> Goddamn it. I want Louis.
<s> I didn't want to wake you.
<s> If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
<s> Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
<s> No. The little one.
<s> You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
<s> Lemme see.
<s> Look at her face. A real bitch.
<s> They're like demons, Jez.
<s> They weren't human!
<s> The numbers stop at 107.
<s> Are we in Brooklyn?
<s> I love you, Jez.
<s> Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
<s> Why didn't you call me?
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
<s> Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
<s> A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
<s> I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
<s> Stick with me, kid.
<s> It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
<s> With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
<s> Mid-town mostly.
<s> West.
<s> Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
<s> The Ladder?
<s> Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
<s> Of course it is. What else could it be?
<s> No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
<s> Why not?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You've seen them?
<s> They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
<s> Bring it in.
<s> He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
<s> Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
<s> What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
<s> What?
<s> We made it?
<s> Done?
<s> What?!
<s> Cool.
<s> And now we're all out of it.
<s> Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
<s> That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
<s> Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
<s> Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
<s> Where is he?
<s> No, you're dead! You're all dead!
<s> We have to get off this ship.
<s> Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
<s> No you don't!
<s> 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
<s> Not so bad.
<s> I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
<s> Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
<s> GO, GO, GO!
<s> Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
<s> Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
<s> Small brains make your balls itch?
<s> So what else is new?
<s> Later.
<s> Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
<s> Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
<s> A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
<s> We're missing two of the kids!
<s> Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
<s> Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
<s> Here --  Take him home.
<s> I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
<s> Two cases. And dinner when you land.
<s> Who's driving the boat?
<s> What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
<s> We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
<s> Have you ever had one do this?
<s> I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
<s> Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Can you do that?
<s> You going to be all right?
<s> I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
<s> What'll I tell the kids?
<s> All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
<s> That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
<s> Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
<s> Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
<s> Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
<s> No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
<s> What do we do?
<s> Be careful, for chrissake.
<s> You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
<s> I wish it would rain...
<s> I can't stand here doing nothing!
<s> Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
<s> A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
<s> We never had any. What's the problem?
<s> Do I set the goddam hook?
<s> Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
<s> It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
<s> Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
<s> Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Thanks for the message.
<s> Cool.
<s> Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
<s> Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
<s> Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yup.
<s> I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
<s> Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
<s> I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
<s> You don't know anything about me!
<s> Oh, go fly a kite.
<s> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
<s> Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
<s> Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
<s> You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
<s> Blood and guts.
<s> Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
<s> I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
<s> Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
<s> You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
<s> I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
<s> Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
<s> Come on, I have something for you.
<s> Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Well, you're lucky it's not you.
<s> Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
<s> Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
<s> Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
<s> I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
<s> Jesus, I didn't say it was.
<s> That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
<s> I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
<s> Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
<s> I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
<s> I'm pregnant.
<s> No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
<s> Or stage parents!
<s> Well, you are kind of... convex.
<s> Keith's hot.
<s> Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
<s> It's a loft.
<s> I suppose anything's possible.
<s> Carrie.
<s> So you don't do any of those things.
<s> Sure.
<s> Took 'em all.
<s> Do what?
<s> What's Early been in jail for?
<s> Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
<s> Early, you are so sweet.
<s> Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
<s> Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
<s> I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
<s> I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
<s> Ain't you goin' to record it?
<s> Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
<s> Nah... how much money have you got?
<s> Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
<s> I still think we should have met them first.
<s> Bitch, bitch, bitch!
<s> Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
<s> Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
<s> Siesta.
<s> Shut your mouth.
<s> He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
<s> ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
<s> Wasn't my fault...
<s> Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
<s> Was up bitch?
<s> You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You think he's got any herb?
<s> He lives on 76th?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
<s> I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
<s> Yep.
<s> Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
<s> Yeah me too nigga.
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Bet.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> So.
<s> Right here.
<s> Yeah me too.
<s> Yeah. Do it again.
<s> She won't? Why not?
<s> Yes.
<s> No...
<s> I guess so.
<s> Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
<s> No.
<s> I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
<s> I didn't bleed.
<s> Mine?
<s> Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
<s> And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
<s> Good luck.
<s> I only did it once and...
<s> Yeah?
<s> I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
<s> I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
<s> Yep.
<s> Because he can like climax you up to that...
<s> Have you ever swallowed it before?
<s> Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
<s> Yeah.
<s> You think so?
<s> It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
<s> What?!
<s> Shh.
<s> Nah.
<s> Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
<s> It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
<s> He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
<s> His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
<s> You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
<s> No it wasn't.
<s> What do you want?
<s> I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
<s> Homesearchers.
<s> Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
<s> I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
<s> It's a voice modulator.
<s> I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
<s> You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
<s> I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
<s> If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
<s> You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
<s> Set up some pieces on the big board?
<s> You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
<s> How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
<s> Thanks, David.
<s> Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
<s> Bingo.
<s> No Frank.  No prints.
<s> There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
<s> Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
<s> That's a big area to cover.
<s> You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
<s> Ten days ago.
<s> Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
<s> We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
<s> Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
<s> He knows you're aware of that.
<s> On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
<s> You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
<s> I want to be the best I can.
<s> Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
<s> What are they, please?
<s> It's alright.
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
<s> I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
<s> Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
<s> Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
<s> I don't think I could.
<s> This isn't a game.
<s> Why?
<s> I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
<s> I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
<s> Would you settle for pepperoni?
<s> You don't understand.
<s> Why not?
<s> Are you going to come tonight?
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
<s> In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
<s> That way. I can feel the cold.
<s> Does the Queen live?
<s> Turold's son was to marry her.
<s> You will tell me her name and we will go together.
<s> No! You cannot know that!
<s> I forbid you!
<s> I have need of friends.
<s> Hah! You don't know me, boy.
<s> Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
<s> Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
<s> At the gallop!
<s> I am Quell.
<s> Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
<s> Would you desert your friends?
<s> Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
<s> Oh, my poor stomach.
<s> Look at its insides.
<s> The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
<s> If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
<s> No. He will master the leader.
<s> It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
<s> The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
<s> We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
<s> They will have the life that you and I might have had.
<s> I will seek the Fortress for you.
<s> She has the power to kill.
<s> The most beautiful woman in the world.
<s> Of what?
<s> No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
<s> ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
<s> OK.
<s> How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
<s> No.
<s> ...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
<s> ...17.
<s> I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
<s> ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing, for the moment.
<s> Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
<s> Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
<s> You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
<s> If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
<s> How serious is it?
<s> Pardon?
<s> What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
<s> You're talking to me?
<s> Show me.
<s> Don't be so sure.
<s> Pacifica, California.
<s> I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
<s> His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
<s> Jumped where?
<s> You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
<s> You tell stories?
<s> You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
<s> Mammoth.
<s> Umm, no.  It's just that --
<s> Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
<s> No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
<s> Yes.
<s> I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
<s> What, come on?
<s> You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
<s> Yes.
<s> This isn't right.
<s> Hello.
<s> We can go to one if you'd prefer.
<s> How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
<s> Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
<s> Is that really what you want to ask me?
<s> That's astonishing. Sera, look...
<s> What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
<s> So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
<s> So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
<s> Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
<s> We?
<s> OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
<s> I am lonely, Yuri.
<s> He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
<s> Who could better understand than me?
<s> I believe you! Don't worry.
<s> Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
<s> Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
<s> I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
<s> No, she'd stashed it by then.
<s> Yes.
<s> I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
<s> I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
<s> For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
<s> I don't know.
<s> She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
<s> That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
<s> Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
<s> Licensed attorney or family member?
<s> I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
<s> You're kidding!
<s> Really?
<s> What?
<s> What?!
<s> Margot!
<s> How do you figure?
<s> No, she can't move for an hour.
<s> We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
<s> What?!
<s> Oh, my God!!
<s> Is he the only one?
<s> What, like on va-kay?
<s> Your what?
<s> How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
<s> So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
<s> See?
<s> I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
<s> Yeah, luckily.
<s> Pull up next to him!
<s> Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
<s> Then we smash 'em?
<s> I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
<s> Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
<s> Cathay?
<s> Who might these friends be?
<s> A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
<s> Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
<s> Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
<s> Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
<s> Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
<s> Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
<s> Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
<s> Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
<s> Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
<s> Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
<s> Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
<s> Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
<s> Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
<s> No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
<s> We'll find it.
<s> Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
<s> We'll trust in faith, Gump.
<s> The chill is worse this night.
<s> On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
<s> We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
<s> Been telling you that all along, lad.
<s> He'll not escape me.
<s> Gonna make ogre-stew!
<s> I may have said perhaps...
<s> Or perchance...
<s> Be patient.
<s> I'll go search for it.
<s> They rival the angels of paradise.
<s> Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
<s> A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
<s> Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
<s> You've freed me, Jack...
<s> Pinching me!
<s> Ask away, sweet man.
<s> Is she fair, this princess?
<s> You'll visit again?
<s> Sorry.
<s> No fear of that now.
<s> Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
<s> Jest with me then.
<s> And as barren of love as stone.
<s> I think she's about to foal.
<s> No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
<s> Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
<s> Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
<s> Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Uh...using Josh like that.
<s> He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
<s> Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
<s> If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
<s> Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
<s> A violation?
<s> After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
<s> Months.
<s> How's your wife?
<s> Maybe that's too long.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I want you both to stay.
<s> Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
<s> You'll know me by the time we're through.
<s> I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
<s> I don't know.
<s> A friend of yours is here.
<s> Don't.  I don't want it.
<s> He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
<s> Good for you.
<s> Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
<s> We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
<s> Thanks for telling me.
<s> Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
<s> I want you to find someone for me.
<s> Three.
<s> I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
<s> What did you do with your dog?
<s> Why call me?
<s> Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
<s> At least we'll have a house to show for it.
<s> I want him with me.
<s> I'm married.
<s> He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
<s> I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
<s> My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
<s> This was my very first slow dance.
<s> Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
<s> How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
<s> I'd rather you not be here.
<s> Going on?
<s> You bit my finger.
<s> What?
<s> It's not my back that's killing me.
<s> We should take a vacation.
<s> I know.
<s> Sam took them to a movie.
<s> Take it off.
<s> Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
<s> Why?
<s> Nigger.
<s> That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
<s> Goodnight, Claude.
<s> He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
<s> He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
<s> I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
<s> I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Good old Monroe.
<s> I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
<s> A loan officer?
<s> Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
<s> What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
<s> There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
<s> Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
<s> Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
<s> Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
<s> No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
<s> Claude.
<s> Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
<s> I'm stuck!
<s> Say what?
<s> All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
<s> We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
<s> Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
<s> I'm not working on a plan.
<s> You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
<s> What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
<s> And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
<s> I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
<s> I said you're soft.
<s> 'Course I was right. About what?
<s> You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
<s> Yeah? You and what army?
<s> You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
<s> 'Preciate it. Claude.
<s> Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
<s> You killed Santa Claus?
<s> Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
<s> Why ain't that pick swinging?
<s> No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
<s> I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
<s> Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
<s> Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
<s> I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
<s> You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
<s> Shoot him, Wilkins!
<s> They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
<s> Me? Willie Long.
<s> Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
<s> He's sick?
<s> Let her go.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
<s> What do you think about... Earth?
<s> So excited.
<s> Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
<s> Well tell her I said "hi" back.
<s> I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
<s> I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
<s> Release the evil?
<s> The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
<s> Coulda been much worse.
<s> That's a pretty brassiere.
<s> Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
<s> I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
<s> We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
<s> Peppermint... alright.
<s> Dude, it's us. Let us in.
<s> You smell like coconuts.
<s> I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
<s> Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
<s> I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
<s> School?
<s> Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
<s> Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
<s> No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
<s> It has nothing to do with you.
<s> Please... No.
<s> No.
<s> I thought I had to do something.
<s> I'm afraid to tell you.
<s> Why is it wrong to run?
<s> I suppose. But what if you want to live?
<s> Thanks... but I have the choice.
<s> All right.
<s> You know something.
<s> I have.
<s> Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
<s> We'll convince them.
<s> How will they know we're coming?
<s> It's the only way.
<s> It doesn't make any difference anymore.
<s> We'll be all right...  We will...
<s> I won't.
<s> You know, Jessica.
<s> I don't know.
<s> At least it's over...
<s> Where are you going?
<s> For as long as I can remember.
<s> Dead... they're dead... and buried.
<s> Sheila'll be at "Tops".
<s> They're comin' with us.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I can't see you tonight.
<s> We should stop seeing each other.
<s> He works for Mr. Eddy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Andy?
<s> We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
<s> Up the stairs - down the hall.
<s> The night before you showed up in the slammer...
<s> Sit down a minute.
<s> Yeah? what did they want?
<s> Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
<s> We'll get a tail put on him.
<s> No... I don't. Why?
<s> Not even close.
<s> No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> I like to laugh, Fred.
<s> Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
<s> Why would anyone do something like this?
<s> He's got some fucked up friends.
<s> I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
<s> Okay... Lemme clear it with...
<s> I can see that.
<s> No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We just killed a couple of people...
<s> Sorry... I...
<s> I don't remember... What happened that night?
<s> You really don't remember?
<s> Yes.
<s> Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
<s> Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
<s> You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
<s> You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
<s> Sounds like a stall to me.
<s> Horns? What kind of horns?
<s> All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
<s> Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. Why?
<s> Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
<s> Look, Bob!
<s> They were.
<s> Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
<s> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<s> Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
<s> Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
<s> Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
<s> Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
<s> The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
<s> You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
<s> Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
<s> Are you the High Lama?
<s> Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
<s> What is it, my son?
<s> That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
<s> Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
<s> You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
<s> See that spot?
<s> You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
<s> What do you mean if we should get out?
<s> Chang's first question was about the pilot.
<s> Nothing about the porters yet?
<s> Porters?
<s> Why - I'm sorry - but I
<s> You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
<s> George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
<s> You're wrong, George.
<s> Yes, everything!
<s> I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
<s> Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
<s> In for what?
<s> Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
<s> I wonder.
<s> Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
<s> Why, mother?
<s> Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
<s> It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
<s> It's not even a fucking door.
<s> Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
<s> For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
<s> No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
<s> Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
<s> I'd go with number three.
<s> Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
<s> What?  Who the hell are you?
<s> I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
<s> This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
<s> Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
<s> If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
<s> It was a long time ago.-
<s> If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
<s> A what?
<s> History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
<s> Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
<s> And what's this ... ?
<s> I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
<s> That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
<s> Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
<s> Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
<s> And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.
<s> Noon exactly.
<s> They're not my pals--
<s> Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
<s> Wait-- listen--
<s> Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
<s> Did it leave?
<s> If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
<s> Can you see the balloon man?
<s> Wait.
<s> Oh, Jesus...
<s> I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
<s> It's all I could safely move.
<s> How do I find the --
<s> No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
<s> This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
<s> This is the official composite of the three precogs?
<s> I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
<s> So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
<s> Everybody runs.
<s> I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
<s> Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
<s> You're kidding, that's today?
<s> All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
<s> The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
<s> Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
<s> Sir?
<s> We're in motion on something.
<s> Any ID on the shooter yet?
<s> Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
<s> Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
<s> You gotta have faith, Dad.
<s> Wanna hear something funny?
<s> The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
<s> I'm your son.  I'm you.
<s> You're not gonna kill me...
<s> I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
<s> Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
<s> It's always in the more gifted of the three.
<s> You look great.
<s> Tell him not now.
<s> Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
<s> I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
<s> Two?
<s> I don't know, why?
<s> Knott!
<s> Who?
<s> Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
<s> The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
<s> Shhh!  They're sleeping.
<s> Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
<s> Snifter are for warm drinks --
<s> We have snifters
<s> Yeah. Take it.
<s> Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
<s> What if I gave you forty?
<s> Somebody's getting comfortable.
<s> Holy shit.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
<s> Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
<s> Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
<s> Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
<s> Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
<s> Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
<s> I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
<s> Draw.
<s> 5-5-1.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
<s> Sure. Yeah.
<s> She was fast, huh?
<s> Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
<s> No.
<s> You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
<s> Take a few days --
<s> I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
<s> Tom, the Welsh dude --
<s> Hi. I'm Jimmy.
<s> Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> So?
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> I thought you hate that club.
<s> Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
<s> You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
<s> Sorry coach.
<s> Fuck him.
<s> Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
<s> I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
<s> This paint sucks. The white shows through.
<s> Shhh... Hello, room service?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
<s> Fuck...
<s> They asked who it was.
<s> Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
<s> I don't know.
<s> So we're working?
<s> You too?
<s> Work's over. I'm gonna party.
<s> Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
<s> C'mon, man...
<s> The what?
<s> I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
<s> They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
<s> I'll be a minute.
<s> You want your surprise?
<s> Well, come on then. It's back here.
<s> What?
<s> Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
<s> Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
<s> Cool. See you later.
<s> Where do you live?
<s> Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
<s> 'Strapped?'
<s> I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
<s> Why? What I say bad?
<s> I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
<s> Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
<s> No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
<s> Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
<s> Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
<s> And the money. Where do we bring the money?
<s> Tell me.
<s> What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
<s> That's none of your fucking business.
<s> And where might that be?
<s> When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
<s> My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
<s> Solid, daddy.
<s> Nnnnnnn!
<s> I don't want your money.
<s> Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
<s> That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
<s> I ain't said I'm ashamed.
<s> Man, I don't want to hear all that.
<s> You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
<s> For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
<s> -- the hardest and the greatest.
<s> Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
<s> And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
<s> I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
<s> What?
<s> Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
<s> Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
<s> So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
<s> What did I tell you about assuming?
<s> Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
<s> Yes, sir, I did.
<s> I say a lot of things.
<s> What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
<s> All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
<s> Murder.
<s> Your control over your children, therefore --
<s> You better believe it.
<s> Well, bitch you move too slow.
<s> Eat lead, coppers.
<s> I ain't doing bad.
<s> Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
<s> All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
<s> Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
<s> It's a little late.
<s> [Si.]
<s> [We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
<s> [Four-seven-four-seven.]
<s> [Who are you?]
<s> My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
<s> Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
<s> A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
<s> Pinta...
<s> Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
<s> Could I stop you?
<s> Still not a question.
<s> It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
<s> If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
<s> Because...  I was already dead.
<s> Then don't come.
<s> When?
<s> Why? You were so pleased with him.
<s> [No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
<s> [You only give information so you can fuck me.]
<s> You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
<s> What was she to Creasy then?
<s> You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
<s> Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
<s> Where?
<s> I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
<s> What happen?
<s> This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
<s> I'm afraid of being lonely.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
<s> Marty...
<s> You gonna die without a son.
<s> Waddaya read there, Joe?
<s> Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
<s> Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
<s> We gotta ask Marty, of course.
<s> Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
<s> Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
<s> Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
<s> So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
<s> Sure, sure.
<s> All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
<s> You talked to Walt?
<s> Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
<s> You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
<s> That's right.
<s> Pour one for Painless.
<s> And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
<s> Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
<s> We been had.
<s> Except we forgot one other small thing.
<s> Sixteen times.
<s> What's he got to write, for God's sake?
<s> Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
<s> I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
<s> When?
<s> Be right with you.
<s> We could steal one of the choppers.
<s> Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
<s> It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
<s> And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> What?
<s> Right.
<s> I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
<s> If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
<s> He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
<s> Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
<s> I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
<s> Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
<s> What do we do?
<s> There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
<s> 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
<s> That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
<s> A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
<s> You think he won't.
<s> Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
<s> Second pint.
<s> That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
<s> He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
<s> I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
<s> If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
<s> They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
<s> Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
<s> There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
<s> I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
<s> I can try, sir.
<s> Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
<s> I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
<s> Nice.
<s> Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
<s> Against what?
<s> Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
<s> No.
<s> Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
<s> I guess so. Then what happened?
<s> A hundred dollars!
<s> All set, Ann?
<s> There is no letter.
<s> Well, you're catching on.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
<s> Take it easy, John Doe.
<s> You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
<s> I ain't seen him for a week.
<s> Did you find her?
<s> They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
<s> Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
<s> Yeah? Well, you can have it!
<s> Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
<s> Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here.
<s> Huh? Get what?
<s> Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
<s> There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
<s> Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
<s> I think it must have been a sea- gull.
<s> Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
<s> You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
<s> Good. I don't want to be late.
<s> Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
<s> Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
<s> Solis said to keep you clear of this.
<s> Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
<s> It was okay.
<s> Is there something wrong with that?
<s> You living together?
<s> Explain how that works.
<s> Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
<s> I think I can handle that one.
<s> Still needs work.
<s> Yeah, first and second.
<s> We lost.
<s> Pull up alongside.
<s> Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
<s> I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
<s> Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
<s> You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
<s> I ain't interested in your life story.
<s> Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
<s> And it's hard to get.
<s> For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
<s> Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
<s> Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
<s> I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
<s> You let us worry about that.
<s> What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
<s> What do you think would be in order?
<s> Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
<s> I want to be put on this case.
<s> Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
<s> -- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
<s> I'm serious, how did you know my name?
<s> Guests?
<s> In here I am.
<s> It's not real.
<s> Yes...
<s> -- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
<s> One would assume so.
<s> Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
<s> -- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
<s> Go!
<s> Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
<s> The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
<s> That's right.
<s> Where?
<s> Her?
<s> Realize?
<s> Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
<s> There?
<s> -- Standard.
<s> Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
<s> IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
<s> I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
<s> OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
<s> ... I just pray we're not too late.
<s> I am the crane, agile and sublime!
<s> OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
<s> GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
<s> Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
<s> LET'S FLY!
<s> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
<s> A real shame.
<s> By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
<s> Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
<s> Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
<s> How about Major Moron?
<s> Quack like a'duck!
<s> So they've been destroyed?
<s> From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
<s> GO POWER RANGERS!
<s> Activating Power Scope!
<s> When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
<s> Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
<s> Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
<s> I came into this world flat on my ass.
<s> I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
<s> You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
<s> Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
<s> What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
<s> We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
<s> I'm already late.
<s> You're sure?
<s> I'm very sorry... I didn't...
<s> I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
<s> No. We ain't even...
<s> It's not myself I'm worried about.
<s> I told you twenty!
<s> What's your problem?
<s> Never threaten me, Boss.
<s> Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
<s> You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
<s> That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
<s> You gotta plan these things.
<s> They're friends of our enemy.
<s> But that's an hour's drive.
<s> Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
<s> Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
<s> You disrespect our tradition.
<s> We can operate around these guys.
<s> Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
<s> Come on. Be polite.
<s> Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
<s> Kill them! Kill them!
<s> Anything!
<s> One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
<s> That a Jew compliment?
<s> Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
<s> I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
<s> Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
<s> Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
<s> Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
<s> A piata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
<s> What'll it do if they pull the plug?
<s> Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
<s> Stu, are you...feeling okay?
<s> You're acting kind of...odd.
<s> It looks so...<u>new</u>.
<s> Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
<s> Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
<s> I'd better go report this...
<s> This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
<s> How am I gonna get past the guards?
<s> I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<s> <i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
<s> Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
<s> <i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
<s> All right. You can come.
<s> Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
<s> What?
<s> We like to think so, yeah.
<s> What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
<s> Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
<s> Behind the books.
<s> I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
<s> Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
<s> Are you sure you got my bag in?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
<s> And where is she?
<s> Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
<s> That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
<s> Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
<s> Yeah. What about the second act?
<s> I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
<s> "There's more light here," he says--
<s> Waiter!
<s> No. How'd you feel? Quick.
<s> *I'm* just waiting for a street car--
<s> You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
<s> Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
<s> Can't that wait, Hubert?
<s> I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
<s> For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
<s> Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
<s> You'll see those committees when we're finished!
<s> Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
<s> I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
<s> Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
<s> Than what?
<s> The porter's got them. They're coming.
<s> For a question!
<s> The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
<s> Nonsense, Jeff.
<s> Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
<s> No, Jeff--please--!
<s> Well--I'll go to Halifax!
<s> Jefferson--
<s> We'd better see.
<s> J-Jefferson Smith.
<s> Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
<s> Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
<s> Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
<s> Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
<s> Committee, huh?
<s> Why?
<s> I said--shall we get started *now* or--
<s> Why?
<s> It *is* not!
<s> No!
<s> And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
<s> In Terry Canyon?
<s> No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
<s> Must have been tickled pink.
<s> Second drawer.
<s> Not another bill?
<s> *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
<s> To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
<s> Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
<s> The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
<s> How are the pigeons?
<s> Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
<s> Well! You don't say!
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> How's that, buddy?
<s> Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
<s> A Bill! Not *him*!
<s> Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Let's get away from here. 
<s> Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
<s> Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
<s> You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
<s> Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
<s> But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
<s> It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
<s> He did it.
<s> --in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
<s> Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
<s> How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
<s> Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
<s> Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
<s> Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
<s> Jim, you don't have to--
<s> No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
<s> He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
<s> I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
<s> All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
<s> Deeds?
<s> Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
<s> Yes, indeedy.
<s> I haven't.
<s> Your Honor!
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes!!!
<s> Look, this is my house. I'd like to
<s> Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
<s> You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
<s> No. That is, I didn't  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
<s> It's wonderful.
<s> I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
<s> Nothing
<s> You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
<s> Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
<s> Are you? When?
<s> No, I don't mind.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Oh, hello darling.
<s> I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
<s> What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
<s> We're not going out tonight.
<s> Have lunch.
<s> I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
<s> Had the boys follow us.
<s> I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
<s> Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
<s> Boy, was he burning.
<s> But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Me, sir?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
<s> The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
<s> Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
<s> Nah.
<s> Only common sense.
<s> What're you talking about?
<s> Oh, they insisted on following me.
<s> Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
<s> They can have the Estate.
<s> Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
<s> But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
<s> I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Ja.
<s> A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
<s> That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
<s> That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
<s> Huh?
<s> One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
<s> Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
<s> Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
<s> Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
<s> Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
<s> I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
<s> Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
<s> That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
<s> You have no pants, sir.
<s> But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Good kids.
<s> Uh-huh. What are they?
<s> You must have been concerned.
<s> Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
<s> Ernest, what do you think?
<s> Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
<s> Now we're back on track.
<s> What exactly is it supposed to do?
<s> Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
<s> My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
<s> I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
<s> I've had my moments.
<s> You've done well.
<s> What?
<s> You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
<s> Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
<s> Doc.  Ainge...
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
<s> -- Go on!
<s> Sure.
<s> Don't need it.
<s> Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
<s> People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
<s> I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
<s> Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
<s> No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
<s> In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
<s> Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
<s> You're upset.
<s> Um-huh.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
<s> What?
<s> It's a big part of the show.
<s> No again?
<s> Is that the question?
<s> Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
<s> This is exactly what I wanted.
<s> I wondered what happened to her...
<s> Holy shit!
<s> You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
<s> No... no training.
<s> What'd I do?
<s> Yes, yes it does...
<s> Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
<s> The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
<s> Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
<s> Even?
<s> Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
<s> Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
<s> What friend? You're my only friend.
<s> What does he want the book for?
<s> Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
<s> No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
<s> Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
<s> I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
<s> Proceed!
<s> No.
<s> You swear?
<s> If you call that a kiss.
<s> And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
<s> What are those mirrors for?
<s> Preparation for what?
<s> You don't believe in curses, huh?
<s> Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
<s> No you're not.
<s> Not unless you call me Rick.
<s> You dream about dead guys?
<s> FINE.
<s> I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
<s> And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
<s> Read the inscription on the cover!
<s> And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
<s> Really?
<s> Your mind is so slippery.
<s> I'll be down in a jiffy.
<s> Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
<s> So who killed him?
<s> When was that?
<s> Then Captain Amazing appeared.
<s> Let's do it.
<s> Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
<s> You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
<s> I got it.
<s> Frankenstein!
<s> Sure -- I guess.
<s> I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
<s> Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
<s> I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
<s> How could I see him if he's invisible?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
<s> I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
<s> Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
<s> The Eradicators!
<s> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
<s> Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
<s> I always knew that you were special.
<s> Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
<s> Who are they?
<s> It's suicide.
<s> I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
<s> I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
<s> The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
<s> Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
<s> Unhappily, it is true, sire.
<s> A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
<s> Yes, sire?
<s> Come in.
<s> Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
<s> He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes -- an excellent idea.
<s> I very much doubt that he will.
<s> Would you like some brandy?
<s> I'll have the fire built up.
<s> Good evening, Mademoiselle.
<s> Is it a nice warm room, sir?
<s> Lisette La Croix.
<s> I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
<s> You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
<s> Of course.
<s> Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
<s> Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
<s> I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
<s> No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
<s> If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
<s> Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
<s> That is correct.
<s> My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
<s> No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
<s> Eugene de Beauharnais.
<s> My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
<s> Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
<s> It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
<s> From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
<s> Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
<s> Anything you need.
<s> Thanks, Unc.
<s> Why you say that?
<s> Yup.
<s> I'm his cousin.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> I'll do it.
<s> What happen?
<s> That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
<s> Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
<s> I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
<s> Oh, yeah, where you work at?
<s> Thanks for reminding me.
<s> I know, be still.
<s> Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
<s> You walked?
<s> I didn't see nothing.
<s> What's the B-G's?
<s> What about me?
<s> Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
<s> Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
<s> I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
<s> Ya'll making me look like a punk.
<s> Nice to meet you?
<s> It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
<s> Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
<s> Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
<s> Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
<s> Ya'll live around here?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I got fired too.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
<s> What urgent message?
<s> That ain't gonna work.
<s> Keep pushing.
<s> Good, let's get out.
<s> Yeah, and hurry up.
<s> Okay.  Bye, Craig.
<s> What you doing to my nephew?
<s> It's an important speech.
<s> That's my girl.
<s> What?
<s> I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
<s> For not believing you.
<s> Same to you.
<s> Then I have time for a drink.
<s> Me?
<s> That's right. That gives you...
<s> You know what I'm gonna do.
<s> Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
<s> Right.
<s> Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
<s> What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
<s> Yeah, all right, listen...
<s> I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
<s> Don't think I won't.
<s> I don't know.
<s> This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
<s> No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
<s> You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I kill her anyway.
<s> No.
<s> Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
<s> Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
<s> How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
<s> Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
<s> I been mindin' Pearl.
<s> When'll the skiff be ready?
<s> It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
<s> Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
<s> You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
<s> About what!
<s> I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
<s> And he killed every last one of 'em!
<s> Satan.
<s> 'Cause you're too little.
<s> Yes, I reckon that's it.
<s> I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
<s> Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
<s> Somewheres. I don't know yet.
<s> Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
<s> She talks to herself.
<s> Dead.
<s> Up river.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
<s> What?
<s> Yonder.
<s> Under the stone in the floor.
<s> But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
<s> Pearl and John.
<s> Our honeymoon.
<s> Harry, what --
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm through, Harry.
<s> It's about that John and that Pearl?
<s> What's wrong, John?
<s> Didn't you hear me, boy?
<s> None of your business, Madam.
<s> Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
<s> He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
<s> I sure as hell hope so.
<s> Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
<s> Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
<s> I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
<s> Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
<s> I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
<s> I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
<s> Who?
<s> You do?
<s> Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
<s> Nan, I --
<s> Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
<s> 'Anything funny' like what?
<s> Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
<s> You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
<s> Right.
<s> I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
<s> We should get her out of here...
<s> Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
<s> Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
<s> Naturally, Comrade.
<s> Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
<s> As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
<s> Just for the honeymoon.
<s> He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
<s> ...and little Lady Beatrice?
<s> Positively not!
<s> Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
<s> That's right.
<s> I can tell you exactly.
<s> We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
<s> They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
<s> What is it?
<s> Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
<s> How many families live here with you?
<s> Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
<s> You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
<s> Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
<s> I think I need my glasses.
<s> Good evening, Monsieur.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
<s> Are they indeed? Thank you.
<s> General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
<s> Yes.
<s> Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
<s> What is it, my boy?
<s> While you eat, you look at the view.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> I'll send you a muff.
<s> What did she say about me?
<s> Two thousand francs.
<s> Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
<s> That's even better.
<s> We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
<s> Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
<s> Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
<s> Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
<s> How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
<s> What?
<s> You're welcome.
<s> I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
<s> You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
<s> It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
<s> I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
<s> It's twelve o'clock.
<s> That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
<s> The telephone is ringing.
<s> Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
<s> You know I want to...
<s> I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
<s> Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
<s> This is a place for workmen.
<s> I promise... I swear.
<s> A funny story?
<s> They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
<s> Much happier.
<s> Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
<s> You can't imagine.
<s> Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
<s> Is this your new dress suit?
<s> How do you do?
<s> Months, Swana.
<s> I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
<s> Hello.
<s> It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
<s> I must ask you to leave.
<s> It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
<s> Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
<s> Yes, it does.
<s> Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
<s> This will do. 
<s> Where do you eat?
<s> Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
<s> Where the hell is he?
<s> Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
<s> Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
<s> You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
<s> I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
<s> No, we have nothing to hide.
<s> Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
<s> Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
<s> You do it.
<s> No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
<s> And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
<s> 'Night, Al.
<s> He's completely lost touch with reality.
<s> That's right ...
<s> I don't know anything about that.
<s> He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
<s> Sir?
<s> You never told him?
<s> It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
<s> You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
<s> Sir?
<s> What about the documents he promised?
<s> Why me?
<s> Thou must.
<s> What about happiness, Mother?
<s> My friends call me "Mister President."
<s> I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
<s> It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
<s> Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
<s> The White House.
<s> Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
<s> But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
<s> I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
<s> I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
<s> ... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
<s> Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
<s> Yes, Mr. President.
<s> Why?
<s> Free, if you're the president.
<s> Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
<s> That'll be the day.
<s> You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
<s> ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
<s> You're shittin' me.
<s> I like jazz ...
<s> Yes, I understand that.
<s> There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
<s> It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
<s> Sir?
<s> Compassionate.  Grateful.
<s> Well, we could delete it.
<s> What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
<s> I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
<s> We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
<s> I don't want them to love me.
<s> Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
<s> Then what are you scared of, honey?
<s> I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You're drunk!
<s> I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
<s> In Angola. Yeah.
<s> When did he die?
<s> No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
<s> No ID in her room?
<s> Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
<s> It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
<s> It's not me he's in trouble with.
<s> I don't know. My mind wanders.
<s> If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
<s> The old boy shot by the highway?
<s> Llewelyn Moss?
<s> No. Probably I don't.
<s> Sheriff?
<s> Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
<s> Okay.
<s> That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
<s> You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
<s> We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
<s> Hyah!
<s> I don't know. Had dreams.
<s> What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
<s> You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
<s> Goin' out.
<s> I shall return.
<s> Hey.
<s> Yes I did.
<s> Not a bleep.
<s> Yeah. I know where you're going.
<s> Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
<s> I don't know. Will there?
<s> With what?
<s> I could come back then.
<s> Sir?
<s> Never mind.  I want a tent.
<s> Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
<s> Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
<s> You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
<s> Yessir. I understand that.
<s> I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
<s> The what?
<s> Another additional.
<s> How would you describe him?
<s> I know what it is. He won't find me again.
<s> I been immobile.
<s> No I don't have it.
<s> I don't know. American citizens.
<s> You do, I reckon.
<s> No sir.
<s> It's fine. Mind your own meal...
<s> They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
<s> Anyway, so what?
<s> I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
<s> Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
<s> She said she was in Arizona, did she?
<s> You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
<s> No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
<s> "Banners?"
<s> No, I was just... How you doing?
<s> Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
<s> 'Kay, good. Bye, then...
<s> I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
<s> ...what're you saying?
<s> Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
<s> Do what?
<s> No, Del.
<s> He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
<s> I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
<s> Yes, she is.
<s> Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
<s> I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
<s> At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
<s> I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
<s> ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
<s> Ad lib?
<s> Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
<s> Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
<s> Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
<s> Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
<s> Make sure it's elevated...
<s> My God... did you get a look at who did it?
<s> Ahh, look, right now's not very...
<s> Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
<s> Really?
<s> I came for love. My fianc is here.
<s> Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
<s> He has a wife?!
<s> Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
<s> David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
<s> You said in L.A., anything goes.
<s> What? Where was he?!
<s> If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
<s> Fine.
<s> You never know who you'll see.
<s> Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
<s> You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
<s> I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
<s> Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
<s> Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
<s> It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
<s> Of what?
<s> I don't follow...
<s> Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
<s> I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
<s> That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
<s> What 'look'?
<s> Should I kill him now?
<s> ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
<s> ...among others.
<s> A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
<s> Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
<s> They paid us half. They still owe us half...
<s> I said, 'No.' N-O.
<s> Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
<s> You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
<s> If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
<s> ...who doesn't?
<s> It is, if you like idiots...
<s> Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
<s> I said I'll think about it.
<s> What the hell's going on?
<s> No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
<s> The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
<s> Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
<s> I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
<s> She's a lesbian.
<s> No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
<s> "A Reason to Love."
<s> It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
<s> Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
<s> Waitaminute -
<s> You mis'able little sneak thief...
<s> No, they never did turn me into a toad.
<s> Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Everett, my beard itches.
<s> Campaign manager? Waldrip.
<s> In any state.
<s> Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
<s> Now Penny, stop that!
<s> The hell you say! Wash is kin!
<s> Don't I know it.
<s> Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
<s> Pete, don't be ignorant-
<s> Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
<s> But... but...
<s> How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
<s> They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
<s> Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
<s> Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
<s> Thank you, sir!
<s> You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
<s> To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
<s> You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
<s> Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
<s> Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
<s> Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
<s> It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
<s> Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
<s> Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
<s> I haven't made up my mind.
<s> Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
<s> You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
<s> Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
<s> No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
<s> You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
<s> My kinda group!
<s> I know who you are and what you want.
<s> Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
<s> Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
<s> Are those for me?
<s> I bet you do!
<s> I don't notice anyone else complaining.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
<s> I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
<s> I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
<s> Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
<s> Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
<s> I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
<s> The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
<s> We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
<s> They're gonna die in there!
<s> Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
<s> You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
<s> Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Don't!
<s> That room!
<s> Shaky?
<s> Say fuck.
<s> Don't though. 
<s> Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
<s> Shhh...
<s> I was trying not to tell you...
<s> I'm dizzy and thirsty.
<s> I'm dizzy, not deaf.
<s> What if I keep dropping?
<s> And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
<s> No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
<s> What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
<s> Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
<s> No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
<s> Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
<s> Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
<s> It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
<s> Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
<s> ...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
<s> Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
<s> You mean...
<s> Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
<s> Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah... let me think about it.
<s> I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
<s> I don't know about that.
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
<s> Where is he?.
<s> I don't know. I really don't.
<s> Late summer.
<s> Uh... uh... I...
<s> That would be nice, too.
<s> I expect to try.
<s> I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
<s> Pride will do.
<s> He's not making light.
<s> I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
<s> My pleasure, sir.
<s> You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
<s> Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
<s> I understand, sir.
<s> Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
<s> It's already over.
<s> We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
<s> You know how old I am.
<s> And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
<s> It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
<s> Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
<s> Thirteen years...
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't know.
<s> For what?
<s> For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
<s> About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
<s> Worse.
<s> Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
<s> Is that right, dad?
<s> Am I really gonna have my own room?
<s> Yayyy!
<s> Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
<s> I swear.
<s> Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
<s> Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
<s> Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
<s> Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
<s> You're telling me.
<s> No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
<s> Wendigo?
<s> Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
<s> Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
<s> It's beautiful!
<s> Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
<s> Yes, I guess I do.
<s> You're doing fine.
<s> Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
<s> Louis, are you sure?
<s> Elizabeth goes free!
<s> Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
<s> And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
<s> By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
<s> Can I trust you?
<s> Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
<s> It's a pirate medallion.
<s> His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
<s> Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
<s> Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
<s> Me!
<s> You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
<s> Nor did you, I noticed.
<s> Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
<s> How did he get off the island?
<s> I don't think that will be necessary.
<s> You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
<s> Smith.
<s> By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
<s> How?  The key's run off.
<s> Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
<s> Aye!  Avast!
<s> 'Bootstrap?'
<s> My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
<s> I'll lead them away.
<s> Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
<s> -- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
<s> Yes it is.  I've seen it.
<s> Yes.
<s> A moment.
<s> Please.
<s> But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
<s> I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
<s> Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
<s> Ain't it.
<s> Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
<s> Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
<s> If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
<s> Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
<s> Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
<s> You better quit pushing me, pal.
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> A man?
<s> Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
<s> Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
<s> I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
<s> Been out for six months now.
<s> Same old Daniel.
<s> And for cleaning up oil spills.
<s> Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
<s> That's what I thought.
<s> Susan, this is the future of America here.
<s> Daniel, what are you doing here?
<s> Yes.
<s> Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
<s> The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
<s> What about it!
<s> I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
<s> What did you want my hair for?
<s> I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
<s> You didn't think I could just leave you?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Yes.
<s> The same thing I suppose.
<s> I remember I was trying to help...
<s> It's a miracle.
<s> Yes, that is what I was thinking.
<s> Yes - Sing Sing.
<s> Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
<s> For what?
<s> Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
<s> Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
<s> It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
<s> Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
<s> Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
<s> Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
<s> I poisoned him.
<s> Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
<s> Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
<s> Well, I should say!
<s> I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
<s> I certainly will.
<s> I'll bite. What's the catch?
<s> No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
<s> Gloria Golden?
<s> The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
<s> Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
<s> Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
<s> A what?
<s> Sure.
<s> I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
<s> Your valet, sir.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> I beg your pardon, sir?
<s> Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
<s> and that
<s> Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
<s> Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
<s> No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
<s> Conrad.
<s> Right.
<s> It'll be ready in a minute.
<s> Sorry, boss
<s> Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
<s> Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
<s> Double strength!
<s> No, sir!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> I just putter.
<s> No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
<s> Yeah ...  That--and ...
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
<s> In my handbag.
<s> I think it looks nice.
<s> Here's my favorite.
<s> But I really should get home.
<s> Yeah. It does.
<s> Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
<s> Oh, gosh no.
<s> Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
<s> Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
<s> It is?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> That's not going to happen!
<s> Still doesn't make it right.
<s> Okay--that's enough!
<s> Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
<s> The other one?
<s> We're supposed to be in school.
<s> We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
<s> As a matter of fact he does.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> What were you doing in a library?
<s> Jen please ...
<s> Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
<s> David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
<s> It's okay.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Wow.
<s> You don't know?
<s> They just grow like that?
<s> We'll just put up the top.
<s> Ooomph?
<s> Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
<s> Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
<s> Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
<s> I didn't do anything wrong.
<s> Just gimme the damn remote!
<s> Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
<s> I'll never be able to do that.
<s> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
<s> This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
<s> You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
<s> No, no, no.
<s> I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
<s> I....please don't do this.
<s> There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
<s> -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
<s> Are your pants off?
<s> I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
<s> I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
<s> You're going to work now?
<s> Can I ask you a question?
<s> Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
<s> Really? Please?
<s> I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
<s> No. I'm sorry.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Ok.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> It's fine. It was fun, though.
<s> No. Not at all. It's nice.
<s> Yeah, not really.
<s> Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
<s> No. I'm the exact opposite --
<s> Ok.
<s> ...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
<s> Did something happen; are you alright?
<s> ...yes I did...?
<s> So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What's that? What is that that you're doing?
<s> It's ok to ask that.
<s> If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
<s> You're hand is bleeding.
<s> .....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
<s> What's that for?
<s> Can you say that my name is Jack?
<s> I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
<s> We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
<s> Well I'm sorry. Before...
<s> I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
<s> I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
<s> ....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
<s> Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
<s> Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
<s> Hi.
<s> Are you serious with this?
<s> Are you going to the party tonight?
<s> You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
<s> Seriously.
<s> You can't just stay in your house.
<s> Yeah but I'm serious.
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
<s> Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
<s> He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
<s> -- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
<s> He did seem a little strange.
<s> For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
<s> "One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
<s> We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
<s> Yes, Abbe?
<s> His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
<s> Not now, or we're both done for.
<s> I've you to look after me, haven't I?
<s> "Turn you out?"
<s> Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
<s> Mustn't do that, sir.
<s> More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
<s> You always do.
<s> I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
<s> I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
<s> I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
<s> Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
<s> A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
<s> What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
<s> Well...?
<s> I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
<s> I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
<s> Poorly.
<s> Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
<s> I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben; I look to the future.
<s> I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
<s> It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
<s> I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
<s> I pray you: be succinct.
<s> It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
<s> Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
<s> Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
<s> Randolph!
<s> Over at RKO?
<s> Yeah
<s> You know that can't happen.
<s> Why is that, Louis?
<s> There's no call for that language-
<s> Yes.
<s> I wanted it
<s> I don't want you to--
<s> Sir?
<s> He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
<s> "You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
<s> "A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
<s> Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
<s> Nonsense
<s> Forget it-
<s> Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
<s> Right-
<s> Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
<s> Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
<s> Don't do this
<s> I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
<s> Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
<s> Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
<s> I don't care.
<s> It's too late. The movie's made
<s> Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
<s> Thank you-
<s> CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
<s> Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
<s> "Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
<s> That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
<s> The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
<s> Happy birthday.
<s> Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
<s> How can he embarrass you?
<s> What?
<s> Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
<s> You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
<s> Where's your wife, Jake?
<s> I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
<s> Here's your glove.
<s> Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
<s> No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
<s> You wasn't with her?
<s> Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
<s> You want the title shot?
<s> This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
<s> Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
<s> Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
<s> I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
<s> Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
<s> Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
<s> No, I just told you what happened.
<s> Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
<s> When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
<s> So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
<s> Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
<s> What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
<s> I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
<s> Who asked you?
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
<s> I took the kids to my sister's.
<s> I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
<s> He should.
<s> That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
<s> He has it. Thank you.
<s> From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
<s> Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
<s> I think they missed their chance with her.
<s> What time?
<s> What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
<s> Ever get an answer?
<s> He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
<s> This is Doyle, Jeff.
<s> Your Lisa?
<s> I told you that --
<s> You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
<s> Where'd they take Lisa?
<s> For getting rid of that cast.
<s> Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
<s> I only have a hundred dollars or so.
<s> Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
<s> Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
<s> She expects me to marry her.
<s> Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
<s> People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
<s> It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
<s> I have a feeling we've just begun.
<s> Smart girl.
<s> Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
<s> You haven't even heard from him?
<s> Mmmm -- hurts a little.
<s> Not too active.
<s> Only because it's expected of her.
<s> -- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
<s> I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
<s> You mean leave the magazine?
<s> Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
<s> She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
<s> Without any future?
<s> I have one now.
<s> I wouldn't dare answer that.
<s> To get on home.
<s> Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
<s> Inside stuff?
<s> I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
<s> But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
<s> Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
<s> A new disease.
<s> What?
<s> Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
<s> Stay there.
<s> Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
<s> Hang loose.  We got all night.
<s> And you dropped it?
<s> How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
<s> Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
<s> Will you wait a minute?
<s> No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
<s> I don't want to learn that!
<s> You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
<s> And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
<s> Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
<s> He's home.  I heard the car.
<s> Plato.
<s> Who knows.  Plato?
<s> What's a chickie-run?
<s> My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
<s> Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
<s> If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> Man, you're schizoid!
<s> When was that?
<s> Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
<s> My gun?
<s> Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
<s> Just a guard.
<s> But you didn't hurt anybody.
<s> Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
<s> But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
<s> You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
<s> Chicken?
<s> Listen--
<s> "Life is crushing in on me."
<s> Who lives?
<s> You going there?
<s> Dig the square wardrobe!
<s> University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
<s> I'm numb.
<s> Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
<s> Neither can I.
<s> If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
<s> I felt like it.
<s> I bet you hear everything I say!
<s> Hi.
<s> Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
<s> I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
<s> He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
<s> Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
<s> It's all right.
<s> He hates me.
<s> Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
<s> No.  I don't even know why I do it.
<s> I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
<s> Gabriel, what are you doing!
<s> What are you doing here?!
<s> Gabriel!
<s> Please, Gabriel, don't...
<s> ...whoever she is.
<s> We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
<s> I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
<s> Radio said.
<s> No, no --
<s> What.
<s> Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
<s> Tell me again.
<s> Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
<s> Yes it was all you --
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> Nick...
<s> Nick, what are you --
<s> You're in on this.
<s> Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
<s> Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
<s> They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
<s> No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
<s> No. It's her brother.
<s> At least gimme video poker.
<s> I'm gonna need some money.
<s> I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
<s> What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
<s> Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
<s> GO!!!
<s> What?
<s> My what?!
<s> Hi, Nick.
<s> You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
<s> Haven't thought about it.
<s> Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
<s> Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
<s> Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
<s> Shoulda written, Rudy...
<s> Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
<s> I don't know, I've seen the business world.
<s> Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
<s> Standing right here, man!
<s> And you set me up.
<s> Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
<s> What? No...
<s> Since when? What the hell is this room?
<s> Yes.
<s> No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
<s> You ain't dying, he is.
<s> Was he all pissed off?
<s> Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
<s> I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
<s> I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
<s> What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
<s> You ever seen this motherfucker before?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
<s> It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
<s> Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
<s> Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
<s> You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
<s> You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
<s> Dead as Dillinger.
<s> No, they're not.
<s> Juicy, junior, real juicy.
<s> Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
<s> He don't tip.
<s> Down to my car.
<s> You didn't ask.
<s> Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
<s> I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
<s> Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
<s> You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
<s> Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
<s> You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
<s> Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
<s> Uh-uh, just cops.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
<s> For all I know, you're the rat.
<s> I think he's just passed out.
<s> You gotta idea, spit it out.
<s> Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
<s> Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
<s> Nobody. The light was bad.
<s> No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
<s> As far as -- Sonora?
<s> I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
<s> In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Thanks.
<s> That's fine.
<s> It's too light yet.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> A little hot.
<s> No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
<s> Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
<s> All right. I'll tell you.
<s> Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
<s> How'd you happen to miss?
<s> You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
<s> Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
<s> Finished, son?
<s> Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
<s> You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
<s> I don't care what she asked you.
<s> You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
<s> What's there to be fair about?
<s> Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
<s> Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
<s> You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
<s> Then why stay in the hills.
<s> What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
<s> I don't like to see you go.
<s> Maybe in Sonora.
<s> And we're running out of that.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
<s> Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
<s> Would they be good to eat?
<s> You were supposed to be reading words.
<s> Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> Okay... maybe that would be best.
<s> Would you die already?!
<s> Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
<s> Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
<s> Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
<s> I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
<s> Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
<s> Open chest!!!
<s> Alright!
<s> Hugh Kane.
<s> Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
<s> Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
<s> Shit!
<s> No. Keep rubbing.
<s> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
<s> Thanks. I made them by hand.
<s> We have to destroy him.
<s> I'll go.
<s> We? What do you mean... we?
<s> Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
<s> I don't know, but I sure hope so.
<s> I wouldn't go that far.
<s> I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
<s> Are these all the subjects?
<s> No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
<s> Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
<s> Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
<s> I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
<s> Father, come in, please.
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
<s> Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
<s> MURDERED?!!
<s> No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
<s> Is there a killer loose?
<s> He certainly drives like a jerk.
<s> Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
<s> Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
<s> She sure can pick 'em!
<s> You scared me.
<s> Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
<s> I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
<s> Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
<s> Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
<s> I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
<s> Oohhhh, Eugene!
<s> Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
<s> Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
<s> It's not fair!!
<s> But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
<s> Socially... I'll have a beer.
<s> No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
<s> I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
<s> No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
<s> I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
<s> We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
<s> Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
<s> Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
<s> Oh, as beautiful as ever.
<s> I can't understand it at all.
<s> I'll try there.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
<s> Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
<s> I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
<s> Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
<s> I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> I won't get lonely.
<s> Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
<s> You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
<s> It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
<s> We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
<s> No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
<s> I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
<s> I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
<s> I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
<s> It might have.
<s> They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
<s> Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
<s> You know where she is?
<s> It seems right to us.
<s> We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
<s> I'm afraid not.
<s> Of course.
<s> I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
<s> Please.
<s> I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
<s> Oh, no problem. It can wait.
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
<s> Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
<s> Who's Elizabeth?
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> Agreed.
<s> Well, I wasn't always impotent.
<s> Basically, yes.
<s> Nothing I can't finish later.
<s> Videotapes.
<s> You went out with her?
<s> Everything about sex.
<s> She said it on her tape.
<s> Then do it.
<s> I have money.
<s> Ann Bishop Millaney.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
<s> You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
<s> No.
<s> Don't you get lonely?
<s> I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
<s> But I don't understand --
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
<s> I'm okay. It's okay.
<s> That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
<s> I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
<s> I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
<s> Yes!
<s> Not very often.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah, so?
<s> No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
<s> Is he still at your house?
<s> Did you find him attractive?
<s> Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
<s> I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
<s> That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
<s> Why not?
<s> You touched him?
<s> You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
<s> I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
<s> You want me to leave?
<s> She still is.
<s> That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
<s> Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
<s> When I was fourteen.
<s> I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
<s> I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
<s> I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
<s> You're intrigued?
<s> She's there? What's she doing there?
<s> Look, I'll call you, okay?
<s> You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
<s> You were prying before?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You know which tapes! Where are they?
<s> Hi. Want a drink?
<s> Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
<s> No, nothing.
<s> Uh, OK. Sure.
<s> Gonna cut me open?
<s> But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
<s> Did I say anything?
<s> Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
<s> NIGHT NIGHT
<s> Of course.
<s> Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
<s> I've caught it once or twice.
<s> It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
<s> They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
<s> Who trusts experts?
<s> I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
<s> Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
<s> Yes, Betty.
<s> Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
<s> Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
<s> Indulge?
<s> I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
<s> Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
<s> Of course.
<s> That doesn't make sense.
<s> He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
<s> I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
<s> Flavors!
<s> Foods!
<s> YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
<s> In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
<s> We're not confused.
<s> It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
<s> I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
<s> Well, then put him at the singles table.
<s> I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
<s> Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
<s> So I guess that's it.
<s> No, I'm an actor.
<s> Maybe. Recognize this?
<s> Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
<s> Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
<s> I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
<s> It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
<s> Now we're talking.
<s> Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
<s> Yeah, that would be a good move.
<s> If that's what feels right.
<s> Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
<s> I want to go home now.
<s> Is she bringing him to the wedding?
<s> We were supposed to play golf.
<s> I will.  See ya!
<s> Well, I've been doing some thinking.
<s> Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
<s> What? Of course I like Christine.
<s> Obsessively.
<s> They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
<s> You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
<s> The plan is... you go.
<s> Quite a week.
<s> I'm fine. You rest.
<s> Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
<s> A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
<s> Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
<s> "The Day After Yesterday."
<s> Um... yeah but it's more...
<s> A paper?
<s> I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
<s> Sure.
<s> I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
<s> Okay.
<s> Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
<s> Do you know what he's been saying to her?
<s> But you wanted to fuck me first.
<s> I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
<s> Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
<s> Both.
<s> Quaffable but far from transcendent.
<s> She doesn't answer me either.
<s> This one?
<s> No dad!
<s> It tastes funny.
<s> Hi baby.
<s> I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
<s> Just make noises then.
<s> Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
<s> From what?
<s> I'm close.
<s> I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
<s> Yes.
<s> Edgar, come inside.
<s> I have some upstairs.
<s> Don't do it.
<s> Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
<s> It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
<s> He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
<s> You'll lose the signal!
<s> Your next water ain't for three days.
<s> It was my fault.
<s> Did it seem short to you?
<s> Someplace safe. How you feeling?
<s> Where's Jake?
<s> And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about.  'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it.  I surely do miss that hat.
<s> He is that.
<s> You haven't got any money.
<s> Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
<s> The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
<s> His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
<s> Howdy.
<s> It's none of your business.
<s> Lucky.
<s> Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
<s> Luck, I guess.
<s> It is that.
<s> Yeah, maybe I will too.
<s> Thanks. That's what I call it too.
<s> You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
<s> I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
<s> That's the good stuff.
<s> That was my plan.
<s> He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
<s> No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
<s> I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
<s> -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
<s> -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
<s> If it's on the page...
<s> She'll do her own.  Theater training.
<s> I'll walk you out.
<s> No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
<s> I do?
<s> I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
<s> No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
<s> You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
<s> Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
<s> Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
<s> Is that a problem?
<s> And what may I ask brought this on?
<s> Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
<s> How did the wall get there?
<s> Simone!
<s> I've seen them all before.
<s> I don't know anything about computers.
<s> Hello, sweetheart.
<s> You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
<s> I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
<s> Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
<s> I love you too, daddy.
<s> I know.  Thank her for me.
<s> No, that was me.
<s> I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
<s> This is the story.
<s> I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
<s> I'm keeping it in trust.
<s> Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
<s> My God, you've got one?
<s> -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
<s> You're in breach.
<s> I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
<s> Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
<s> Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
<s> We can keep it in the bathroom.
<s> Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
<s> No, just one.
<s> I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
<s> That I'm a freak.
<s> Yes.
<s> You haven't told bedtime stories before?
<s> I guess she did.
<s> Where will you go, where no one has died?
<s> I definitely won't.
<s> Really?
<s> What?
<s> Tell you my secrets.
<s> They scare me too sometimes.
<s> Dead people.
<s> What?
<s> They used to hang people here.
<s> I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
<s> Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
<s> Not according to these.
<s> The band.
<s> Not lately.
<s> I didn't do anything --
<s> Sorry.
<s> Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
<s> I could. You sucked.
<s> All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
<s> Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
<s> Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
<s> "-- an AXE!"
<s> "And a slash-slash there --"
<s> Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
<s> Pardon?
<s> Not while you're driving.
<s> Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
<s> Amen.
<s> Bzzzzzzzzzt!
<s> Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
<s> Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
<s> I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
<s> You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
<s> Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
<s> Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
<s> I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
<s> I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
<s> Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
<s> You took Bill.
<s> Just block the doors, any way you can.
<s> Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
<s> The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
<s> What do you see? I see a butterfly.
<s> Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
<s> Brought you munchies.
<s> Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
<s> Hey, look!
<s> If...?
<s> I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
<s> For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
<s> Whaddya want to know? My sign?
<s> They're both a challenge.
<s> Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
<s> Ciao.
<s> He's after us again!
<s> Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
<s> Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
<s> Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
<s> Ummm?
<s> Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
<s> Bandit II?
<s> You gotta admire the man's determination.
<s> Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
<s> That's me.
<s> Another time.
<s> See.
<s> Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
<s> Forty-two minutes ahead.
<s> What's your twenty?
<s> I ran into complications.
<s> Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
<s> You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
<s> Go head on, breaker.
<s> See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
<s> You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
<s> Then it must be a helluva idea.
<s> Now, you just find him, son.
<s> That's correct.
<s> What kind of personnel?
<s> All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
<s> Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
<s> -- he was wearing one of our jackets.
<s> Uh, yeah.
<s> Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
<s> You shot me and murdered my friends.
<s> I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
<s> I left him a message.
<s> ...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
<s> Only if you really, truly mean it.
<s> That's right! RIGHT NOW!
<s> We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
<s> GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
<s> -- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
<s> I thought Heller was a double op?
<s> -- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> ...He does now...
<s> But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
<s> A million flat.
<s> Nah, nuthin' on my end --
<s> Got hit twice.
<s> Like a mafucka.
<s> The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
<s> Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
<s> He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
<s> What's the time frame?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Can it work?
<s> We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
<s> Not her.  It.
<s> He'll let me in.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Human beings can die.
<s> Yes.
<s> Her oxygen would have run out.
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> And tonight?
<s> As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
<s> I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
<s> I did too.
<s> You don't know?
<s> I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
<s> I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
<s> Not this time.
<s> Then you'll die.
<s> Then you won't make it.
<s> You exist here.  I keep telling you.
<s> I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
<s> A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
<s> I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
<s> Please.  Don't.
<s> Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
<s> It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
<s> No, Ma'am.
<s> Beg pardon?
<s> Big talk... Desperate guy.
<s> They're kind of fuzzy.
<s> Could be, I guess.
<s> Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
<s> Tell it like it is.
<s> Claire...!
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
<s> I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
<s> Do you dance?
<s> Just putting in an appearance then.
<s> ... I don't want to talk about it...
<s> Claire...
<s> Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
<s> Too kinky.
<s> What?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> 'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
<s> Well, actually, she looks better than that.
<s> Oh, some shit.
<s> It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
<s> What're you talking about --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
<s> Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
<s> I just sat and listened.
<s> If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
<s> No, I need'm now!
<s> Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
<s> Is she injured?
<s> I brought the girl.  She's outside.
<s> Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
<s> I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
<s> I'm not lettin' no one go.
<s> I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
<s> Lay back, Mack.
<s> We're gonna pass the street.
<s> Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
<s> Be nice.
<s> Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
<s> I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
<s> I know.  I've got one too.
<s> Don't be pitiful.
<s> Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
<s> You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
<s> Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
<s> Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
<s> But you like that in a man?
<s> I know what you mean.  I...
<s> Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
<s> Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
<s> I know him.
<s> --but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
<s> Yes.  Do you have a date?
<s> It'll shut itself off.
<s> This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
<s> I will finish what I've begun
<s> Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
<s> Hi, Professor.  What's up?
<s> An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
<s> Actually, I got this spider bite
<s> Really, Professor, I--
<s> Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
<s> Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
<s> Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
<s> I wouldn't talk about things like that.
<s> Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
<s> Static!
<s> Who is it?
<s> That's right.
<s> Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
<s> Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
<s> Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
<s> You are talking crazy!
<s> It's on me.
<s> What are the chances busting out of here?
<s> I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
<s> Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
<s> He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
<s> All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
<s> Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
<s> Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
<s> Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
<s> What's the award?
<s> Where'd that come from?
<s> Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
<s> It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
<s> Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
<s> You hold him. I'll slug him.
<s> Do Jimmy Durante!
<s> It's that song, Harry!
<s> Anything else?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
<s> Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
<s> You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
<s> Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
<s> It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
<s> Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
<s> I called it the last time, didn't I?
<s> You did!
<s> What's the decoy?
<s> Shoot!
<s> You can tell Father Murray to --
<s> Nothing for Kuzawa?
<s> What about the radio?
<s> Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
<s> Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
<s> Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
<s> Give me the radio.
<s> Who's the guy, Schulz?
<s> The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
<s> We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
<s> Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
<s> I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
<s> Thanks for pointing that out.
<s> Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
<s> It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
<s> That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
<s> You get what?
<s> The station complement was nineteen.
<s> I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
<s> I'll go. You have the Bridge.
<s> Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
<s> What happened to you?
<s> It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
<s> Phasing? To where?
<s> What's normal?
<s> Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Make it so.
<s> No, sir.
<s> They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
<s> You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
<s> Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
<s> There are no other ships in the system.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
<s> Execute!
<s> He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
<s> Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
<s> Nothing. As before.
<s> Scotty...?
<s> Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
<s> I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
<s> You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
<s> There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
<s> Short range scan.
<s> ... Or <u>who</u>.
<s> That may be difficult...
<s> Not exactly.
<s> I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
<s> It was the only way to solve certain problems --
<s> If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
<s> Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
<s> We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
<s> I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<s> This Vulcan -- is he alive?
<s> What? What are you saying?
<s> But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
<s> Much is at stake...
<s> Yes. And I know you.
<s> The ship... Out of danger...?
<s> I'll need it, Sulu.
<s> Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
<s> What about surface life signs...?
<s> Come on!
<s> It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
<s> Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
<s> Genesis?! Whatever for?
<s> Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
<s> Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
<s> 
<s> No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
<s> You should take the Vulcan, too.
<s> I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
<s> Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
<s> Yes... But -- how...?
<s> You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
<s> Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
<s> Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
<s> Wait!... Wait...
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
<s> They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
<s> Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
<s> Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
<s> As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
<s> He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
<s> Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
<s> And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
<s> We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
<s> Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
<s> I have my orders.
<s> I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
<s> Why? Why didn't you tell me?
<s> Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
<s> Go back. I'm going to kill him.
<s> I saw it -- !
<s> Never mind! Hurry!
<s> There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
<s> Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<s> Only half of you would get there.
<s> Oh, I believe it.
<s> Locking phasers on target.
<s> What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
<s> Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
<s> KHAN!
<s> I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
<s> Spock?
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
<s> All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
<s> Not at present.
<s> Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
<s> The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
<s> To be sure, Captain.
<s> Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
<s> How far?
<s> Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
<s> Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
<s> Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
<s> Best we could do in two hours.
<s> He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
<s> You earned it.
<s> You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
<s> There is no such regulation.
<s> I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
<s> I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
<s> Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
<s> At what.
<s> Stop engines.
<s> I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
<s> Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
<s> Never, sir.
<s> Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
<s> We've done it before.
<s> Would you prefer to do nothing?
<s> Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
<s> Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
<s> ... My God...
<s> We're just -- observing.
<s> Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
<s> Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
<s> Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
<s> No, <u>my</u> name.
<s> Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
<s> Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
<s> Is there something wrong with the one I have?
<s> Why's that?
<s> I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
<s> Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
<s> A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
<s> How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
<s> It's his way.
<s> Hm?
<s> No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
<s> They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
<s> Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
<s> Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
<s> You need me.
<s> ... You have a point...
<s> Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
<s> The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
<s> In progress, Admiral.
<s> You've programmed that from memory...?
<s> Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
<s> And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
<s> I see.
<s> How will playing cards help?
<s> Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
<s> Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
<s> Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
<s> Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
<s> Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
<s> From a city? That doesn't make sense....
<s> Nothing... I should never have left him...
<s> It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
<s> To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
<s> You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
<s> This way!
<s> I'll be here.
<s> I understand.
<s> For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
<s> Sometimes I do.
<s> I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
<s> It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
<s> Bye.
<s> 'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
<s> They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
<s> How about a passive radiation scan?
<s> Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
<s> It is not over.
<s> That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
<s> The Ba'ku.
<s> We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
<s> If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
<s> Do you know how to disable the injector?
<s> Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
<s> Do you know how they were damaged?
<s> Why would they fire at him without provocation?
<s> The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
<s> You got me, Commander.
<s> Options?
<s> If it works you mean.
<s> We're through running from these bastards.
<s> ... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
<s> You've not aged a day since then?
<s> We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
<s> Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
<s> Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
<s> Transferring controls to manual.
<s> Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
<s> ... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
<s> Augh?
<s> We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
<s> Yes...
<s> Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
<s> Not yet.
<s> You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
<s> And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
<s> Vulcan?
<s> Contact Starfleet Command.
<s> According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
<s> I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
<s> I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
<s> Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
<s> I told you, there's no --
<s> Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
<s> Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
<s> As they used to say... all systems are go.
<s> Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
<s> Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
<s> California. San Francisco.
<s> And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
<s> I can try.
<s> And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
<s> I have to...
<s> No... I'm from France.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> They did it... they assimilated Earth.
<s> In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
<s> We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
<s> They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<s> Computer -- thermal enhancement.
<s> Agreed. Options?
<s> Where the hell are they going?
<s> Hold that thought.
<s> Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
<s> You heard the order, Lieutenant.
<s> I wish I knew. Uhura?
<s> What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
<s> Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
<s> We're not finished.
<s> Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
<s> No way.  You see this?
<s> Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
<s> Come on...
<s> Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
<s> Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
<s> I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
<s> I'm not sure how to take that.
<s> How can I trust --
<s> I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
<s> Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
<s> I know what you mean...
<s> First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
<s> Anything else you want to tell me?
<s> Candidate for what?
<s> Energize...
<s> Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<s> You hear that?
<s> I was asked by my father to open neg-
<s> Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
<s> Why would they give them to us?
<s> WE SURRENDER.
<s> Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
<s> We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
<s> Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
<s> I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
<s> We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
<s> Nevertheless.
<s> If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
<s> This one can.
<s> I believe I am.
<s> Yes, please continue.
<s> You are me.
<s> No. Can I move now?
<s> I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
<s> To happy endings.
<s> You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
<s> Now, you make a toast.
<s> New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
<s> Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
<s> Sorry, sir.
<s> It would appear so.
<s> It'll only work for one of us.
<s> They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
<s> Of you?
<s> Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
<s> Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
<s> Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Is he sincere about wanting peace?
<s> I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
<s> Make it so.
<s> Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
<s> I can feel your desire, Deanna.
<s> Do you have life support?
<s> What do we know about the planet?
<s> Theories?
<s> What do we know about the population?
<s> Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
<s> What programs were accessed?
<s> I'll take care of it, sir.
<s> A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
<s> There's more... as always. He's Reman.
<s> What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
<s> That will never happen.
<s> Not yet, Mister Worf.
<s> On screen.
<s> I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
<s> Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
<s> A coup d'etat?
<s> She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
<s> No?
<s> Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
<s> Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
<s> Yes. The eyes have it.
<s> And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
<s> Age before rank, Jean Luc.
<s> I always hoped I would hit two meters.
<s> There is that.
<s> In time.
<s> Why am I here?
<s> We are.
<s> Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
<s> You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
<s> Disruptors are off-line, sir.
<s> He's a very unusual android.
<s> Find her again.
<s> What?!
<s> FULL STOP AND FIRE !
<s> 
<s> And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
<s> I don't want to scare them away.
<s> No, we can handle this.
<s> I make maps.
<s> They must have picked it up in space.
<s> I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
<s> Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
<s> Is that what's affecting your performance?
<s> Washington thinks it's too late for that.
<s> Dashboard.
<s> Flashlight.
<s> We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
<s> You're full of tricks, aren't you?
<s> Gas good?
<s> Space?
<s> Shit?
<s> You. Mouth closed.
<s> I do not understand.
<s> Yes. Day... night.
<s> Three nights... two days.
<s> Why?
<s> You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
<s> Yes?
<s> What?
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
<s> I understand.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. Get in.
<s> You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
<s> Where did you learn that?
<s> You promised you would get me to my ship.
<s> You can stop. I will go on alone.
<s> I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
<s> Horses.
<s> I understand.
<s> Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
<s> Where?
<s> I will.
<s> Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
<s> What's all this squid shit?
<s> You're too goddamned paranoid.
<s> I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
<s> Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
<s> Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
<s> Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
<s> Step into my office.
<s> This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
<s> Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
<s> I'm on her.
<s> Not now... I don't want to think about it--
<s> Why me?
<s> Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
<s> Okay... what about Strickland?
<s> Where's Faith?
<s> I won't say anything.
<s> Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
<s> Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
<s> Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
<s> That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
<s> Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
<s> Coming with you.
<s> Look, I gotta get some sleep.
<s> Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
<s> Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
<s> She still loves me.
<s> She's my destiny.
<s> Black.  Jack.
<s> Wants to share.
<s> You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
<s> Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
<s> So the guy's not a sicko.
<s> That's where it gets a little strange.
<s> Now you're really getting paranoid.
<s> OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
<s> This tie doesn't go with blue!
<s> It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
<s> Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
<s> Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
<s> Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
<s> Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
<s> I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
<s> This isn't in our database?
<s> Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
<s> Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
<s> Hi. What's in the case?
<s> Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
<s> Another what?
<s> "Was?"
<s> What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
<s> I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
<s> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
<s> The other reason?
<s> Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
<s> Don't be too harsh.
<s> I know.
<s> What did you tell him?
<s> We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
<s> What's that?
<s> I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
<s> I guess I'm a little paranoid.
<s> Slow down a second, you met with Low --
<s> Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
<s> Yeah, of course.
<s> I...
<s> Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Who told you about her?
<s> You? You went by the book?
<s> Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
<s> [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
<s> So you're the new meat?
<s> I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
<s> MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
<s> Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
<s> It's over for you.
<s> I don't know about that.
<s> What kind of car do you drive?
<s> I'd say about two weeks.
<s> ...Four days..?
<s> What an asshole.
<s> Could you believe it?
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
<s> No...
<s> Yeah. And an actor.
<s> ...It's really getting late.
<s> ...Six months.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What kind of things?
<s> Really?
<s> Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
<s> I heard you might be moving back...
<s> Goodbye. I lov... 
<s> Right.
<s> Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
<s> I didn't want to say anything.
<s> I do. Good for you, man.
<s> I don't know. Eight or Nine.
<s> ...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
<s> It's unbelievable.
<s> She wasn't your type anyway.
<s> Make someone bleed.
<s> He's trying to be an actor.
<s> ...He's derivative...
<s> Damned if I know...
<s> Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
<s> Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
<s> Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
<s> Hang on, Voltaire.
<s> What are you talking about? Vegas?
<s> I'm not going to Vegas.
<s> Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
<s> I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
<s> This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
<s> She smiled baby.
<s> We're gonna get laid, baby.
<s> Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
<s> What?!?
<s> I know, but...
<s> Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
<s> Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
<s> I didn't even like her, to be honest.
<s> Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
<s> Michelle went for you, right.
<s> How?
<s> That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
<s> You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
<s> Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
<s> Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
<s> This version doesn't have fighting?
<s> What? That was the best part of the old game.
<s> ...It looked money.
<s> She didn't notice.
<s> You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
<s> I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
<s> Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
<s> Oh. He's got it under control...
<s> Chelios to Roenick...!
<s> Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
<s> Be smart about it.
<s> Six.
<s> What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
<s> Ba Fa Goulle.
<s> Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
<s> How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
<s> Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
<s> Sure.
<s> Are you worried about security for your million?
<s> You understand him better than anyone.
<s> On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
<s> I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait.  He won't last out the night.
<s> Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
<s> I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
<s> I'll need him.
<s> How?
<s> Yes.
<s> You want him to stay in this country.
<s> Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
<s> No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
<s> Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
<s> Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
<s> He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
<s> Come here a minute, Fredo.
<s> I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
<s> No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
<s> We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
<s> Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
<s> I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
<s> Yes.  Tell me.
<s> Michael you're trying to scare me...
<s> My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> Huh?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
<s> On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
<s> Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
<s> I do wish to be baptized.
<s> Just be patient.
<s> Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
<s> Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
<s> Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
<s> You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
<s> Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
<s> Did you speak to my father?
<s> No, I like him.
<s> It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
<s> Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
<s> Can you mix a martini?
<s> Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
<s> Marge! You've got to hear this!
<s> I love jazz.
<s> Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
<s> What?
<s> No! I've got more than one shirt!
<s> Relax.
<s> What club?
<s> You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
<s> I thought you'd missed the train.
<s> I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
<s> I'm prepared to take the blame.
<s> To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
<s> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
<s> So tell me.
<s> You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
<s> Aye, aye.
<s> Dickie?
<s> I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
<s> Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
<s> What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
<s> Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
<s> I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
<s> We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
<s> Such as?
<s> Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
<s> Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
<s> My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
<s> Hello Marge!
<s> Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
<s> I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
<s> You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
<s> Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
<s> I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
<s> You know what -- I am.
<s> He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
<s> I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
<s> A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
<s> I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
<s> You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
<s> I'll fix some drinks.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
<s> Was who Meredith?
<s> Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
<s> Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
<s> Who mam?
<s> It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
<s> Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
<s> Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
<s> Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
<s> Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
<s> I know. I could have picked you up.
<s> Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
<s> I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
<s> I'm leaving.
<s> Well, I don't follow movies too much...
<s> I'm getting a taxi.
<s> Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
<s> That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
<s> That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
<s> With the other hand, right?
<s> Show me how he did that again.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And what happened?
<s> Stick up?
<s> Iris.
<s> That's what you think.
<s> You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
<s> I understand, mister. It means something, really.
<s> I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
<s> Besides, I've got to stay here.
<s> Do I look like a narc?
<s> You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
<s> I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
<s> I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
<s> I know. I tried that.
<s> Education?
<s> What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
<s> My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
<s> Shit.
<s> Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
<s> Funny, you don't look hip. 
<s> O.K., cowboy.
<s> Iris?
<s> It happens.
<s> I know.
<s> You want to talk about it?
<s> That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
<s> You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
<s> Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
<s> Partners.
<s> Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
<s> You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
<s> I wish you were coming with me.
<s> Damn...
<s> Delly?  In here.
<s> Well...
<s> You mean,  me?
<s> You look... different.
<s> It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
<s> Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
<s> You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
<s> Oh...
<s> Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
<s> No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
<s> Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
<s> Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
<s> Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
<s> I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
<s> I... I need a drink of water.
<s> Mr. Appleton, you will...
<s> No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
<s> You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
<s> Or the Bijou.  Either one.
<s> The Bijou?
<s> That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
<s> Yes.
<s> Dad, I...
<s> ... what?
<s> Exactly.
<s> And I won't be a communist anymore.
<s> Luke didn't smoke.
<s> Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
<s> What?
<s> Oh.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
<s> My girlfriend.  If she still is...
<s> Yes?
<s> Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
<s> Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
<s> Yes.
<s> She already has a daughter.
<s> I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
<s> You get straight to the point, don't you?
<s> I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
<s> In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
<s> Take them.
<s> I don't think your mother would like that.
<s> I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
<s> I don't know yet.
<s> Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
<s> That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
<s> Morning.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes?
<s> Mmmm.
<s> D'you want me to order one for you?
<s> That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
<s> Impossible.
<s> For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
<s> I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
<s> I got them all, Mother.
<s> Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
<s> I'm sorry, Mitch.
<s> If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
<s> I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
<s> I started to say... inside...
<s> Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
<s> I don't mind, really.
<s> I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
<s> We know what it is, Al.
<s> Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
<s> I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
<s> I'm awfully sorry.
<s> Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
<s> How can you tell?
<s> I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
<s> Criminal.
<s> Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
<s> Why would I want to see you, of all people?
<s> I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
<s> No.
<s> What do you want ?
<s> Helping travelers.
<s> What'll it say?
<s> No, I have my things in the car.
<s> Well, they'll go along with anything.
<s> Take wing!
<s> Mmm?
<s> It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
<s> It may not be last week again for a long long time.
<s> I thought they'd have stopped by now.
<s> I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
<s> I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
<s> No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
<s> I'm not sure, but...
<s> How?
<s> Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
<s> That would hardly be possible.
<s> Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
<s> All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
<s> I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
<s> Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
<s> I've heard of it.
<s> But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> I wanted to see the white horse --
<s> I am the best man for the job.
<s> That's a good boy, Toddy.
<s> That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
<s> The heart pumps it.
<s> The nerve centers -- the brain --
<s> I take no gifts from you.
<s> So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
<s> I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
<s> Only Brother.
<s> Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
<s> Nearly a year.
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
<s> A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
<s> I'll get him.
<s> I'm looking for my friends.
<s> I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
<s> I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
<s> Keep that thing away from me.
<s> A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
<s> I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
<s> I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
<s> When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
<s> My father.
<s> It's what Lauren would do.
<s> Erin. I'll always be with you.
<s> I know the guy leaves a sign.
<s> Could say that.
<s> He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
<s> She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
<s> Just hold on to me.
<s> Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
<s> I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
<s> Gee! How could they make a landing?
<s> I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
<s> He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
<s> Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
<s> Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
<s> We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
<s> And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
<s> I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
<s> Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
<s> You still haven't answered my question.
<s> I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
<s> It won't work.
<s> Where is the meeting going to be?
<s> I'd give you a very good price.
<s> They would have killed this man?
<s> You gotta drive!
<s> We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
<s> What's goin' on, Marko?
<s> Yeah.
<s> His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
<s> Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
<s> What happens in tow and a half hours?
<s> Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
<s> Can't.  Got plans of my own.
<s> Michael!...
<s> Smells like something died.
<s> I guess no one cares what I got a job.
<s> We can't talk about it on the phone.
<s> Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
<s> But, Mom...
<s> Do I look that needy?
<s> You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
<s> I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
<s> Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
<s> Star.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Michael's great.  I like Michael.
<s> Because I love you...
<s> That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
<s> Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
<s> I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
<s> Wanna go to the comic book store?
<s> The Marines.
<s> I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
<s> And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
<s> Let's load 'em.
<s> It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
<s> Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
<s> And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
<s> I don't know who to trust.
<s> Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
<s> Now who'd go and do...
<s> What's it going to do, being a plant?
<s> Hell no.
<s> Was dark... find a light...
<s> Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
<s> Look, I'm just guessing...
<s> But...
<s> What?
<s> All in Norwegian.
<s> How far's that?
<s> Don't let up, Childs!
<s> I ain't going with Sanchez.
<s> It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
<s> Just keep looking.
<s> Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
<s> The generator!
<s> Calm down and get in your position.
<s> So what do you make of it?
<s> MacReady...?
<s> No...
<s> But you're only a mud carrier.
<s> What are you?
<s> I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
<s> Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
<s> Last night.
<s> Kalen... hold on a minute.
<s> It frightens you.
<s> Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
<s> The air... the power.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I won't leave you like this.
<s> You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
<s> Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
<s> I just love mechanical things.
<s> I -- what are you?!
<s> No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
<s> Got here as soon as I could.
<s> Sorry... I was distracted.
<s> And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
<s> The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
<s> Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
<s> I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
<s> Perseverance.
<s> That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
<s> What is it?
<s> Sir...?
<s> All right, all right -- here -- everything --
<s> I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
<s> For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
<s> Then you came to a desert and mountains...
<s> Learning was important?
<s> Orion's belt...
<s> You lost someone.
<s> Someone you loved very much.
<s> It's undamaged?
<s> Tell him to go away --
<s> The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
<s> Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
<s> They've gone to a better place.
<s> We choose to believe it.
<s> Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
<s> They're inside --
<s> Then don't.
<s> Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
<s> My business?
<s> You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
<s> Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
<s> No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
<s> Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
<s> Yeah, but I don't know what.
<s> What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
<s> [Beat] What?
<s> I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
<s> Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
<s> Ok. Ssh. Rest.
<s> Then, where are you going?
<s> I still don't either, even after all these years.
<s> I was working with a boy named Eugene.
<s> How do you know about Dr. Becker?
<s> No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'll manage.
<s> The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
<s> Thanks.
<s> That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
<s> You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
<s> You want to come on in?
<s> Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
<s> It's him.
<s> He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
<s> Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
<s> It's okay.  I'm married, too.
<s> Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
<s> Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
<s> Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
<s> Christ, sure... yes!
<s> Not yet.
<s> I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
<s> No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
<s> Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
<s> Maybe.
<s> You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
<s> What time are you gonna pick me up?
<s> We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
<s> Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
<s> Get the car!
<s> I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
<s> Which part?
<s> No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
<s> It's probably not a good idea.
<s> You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
<s> Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
<s> Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
<s> You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
<s> Nothing.  It got messed up.
<s> Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
<s> Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
<s> Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
<s> What.
<s> You're right.
<s> We should have just ignored him.
<s> Okay, Louise... It's okay.
<s> Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
<s> Eeuww.
<s> Oh.
<s> Why?
<s> You too, sweetie, the best.
<s> How do you stay so positive?
<s> Go?
<s> You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
<s> Good-looking?
<s> Never?
<s> Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
<s> I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
<s> That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
<s> Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
<s> No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
<s> No.
<s> Jesus Christ you're right.
<s> Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
<s> Fucking Sully! Look at you!
<s> Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
<s> Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
<s> When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
<s> What?
<s> Forget it. It was... fun.
<s> Warren!
<s> Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
<s> No.
<s> You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
<s> So you found Mary?
<s> It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
<s> You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
<s> Oh, uh, I resigned.
<s> Good good.
<s> Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
<s> Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
<s> Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
<s> Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
<s> But... but you knew people at Harvard.
<s> And you met Mary how?
<s> How'd you manage that one?
<s> Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
<s> Fucking sickening.
<s> Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
<s> Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
<s> 'That right? Good for you.
<s> The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
<s> Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
<s> Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
<s> Where's Puffy?
<s> Thanks a lot, Ted.
<s> Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
<s> Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
<s> What are you?
<s> Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
<s> That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
<s> Trying to be.
<s> Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
<s> Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
<s> I think a little of both.
<s> Teddy, be brave.
<s> Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
<s> I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
<s> Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
<s> So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
<s> We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
<s> Then you'll call, right?
<s> Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
<s> Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
<s> -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
<s> I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
<s> I think it's a bad idea.
<s> Then they should speak up.
<s> -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
<s> We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
<s> The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
<s> I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
<s> Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
<s> He was.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
<s> There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
<s> Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
<s> Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
<s> No way.
<s> You're scared to cancel on Daly.
<s> We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
<s> Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
<s> I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
<s> Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
<s> We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
<s> Hey. Nice tie.
<s> Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
<s> Rug samples.
<s> Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
<s> Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
<s> FBI? What you investigatin'?
<s> Again. Figures, man.
<s> No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
<s> No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
<s> Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
<s> Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
<s> Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
<s> I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
<s> Thanks, Cooch.
<s> She's that subtle?
<s> We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
<s> No way, Cooch.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> You've got no jurisdiction.
<s> His spiritual mother...
<s> Let's go.
<s> Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
<s> Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
<s> Well, it was just a dream, I --
<s> Yeah. Fitful dreams.
<s> I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
<s> Bullshit, let's get outta here,
<s> Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
<s> Come back?
<s> At Sioux Falls Pen?
<s> Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
<s> Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
<s> What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
<s> Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
<s> You know. The finger.
<s> No.
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> Not to me.
<s> Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
<s> I like to play "reality".
<s> Your watch.
<s> I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
<s> I hope you find him.
<s> Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
<s> Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
<s> YEAH, COUGAR?
<s> It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
<s> No! Now we're inverted!
<s> BREAKING LEFT!
<s> Okay.
<s> 280, 290, 300 knots.
<s> What do I want?
<s> Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
<s> What?
<s> LOOK OUT!
<s> No. You can be mine!
<s> Tell me one thing.
<s> Three guesses.
<s> What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
<s> How's it goin', Coog?
<s> We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
<s> Then why are you here?
<s> Or....
<s> I don't know...
<s> The Last Resort.
<s> Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
<s> Thank you.
<s> No, sir.
<s> They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Don't be an idiot.
<s> Where?
<s> O.K., everybody pull out!
<s> Relax, you'll live longer.
<s> You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
<s> Well don't.
<s> A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
<s> You went to Rekall, remember?
<s> Come on!
<s> All right, forget about it.
<s> It was implanted by the Agency.
<s> I didn't know you were so kinky.
<s> Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
<s> I used to model for 'em, why?
<s> All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
<s> You two-faced-bastard.
<s> Aliens built it.
<s> Enough for everybody to breathe?
<s> Cannon fuse.
<s> Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
<s> Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
<s> We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
<s> Burt, can you hear me now?
<s> Well, who put you two in charge?
<s> Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
<s> I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
<s> Well, sure.
<s> He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
<s> Oh shit!
<s> I think we wait right here.
<s> Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
<s> Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
<s> Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
<s> A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
<s> Like hell you are.
<s> Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
<s> Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
<s> I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
<s> You bet.
<s> Around here?  Why would they?
<s> Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
<s> An hour after you picked it up!
<s> He was your snitch.
<s> Where's the nearest hospital?
<s> -- With objection!
<s> Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
<s> I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
<s> I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
<s> It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
<s> I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
<s> I didn't take my eyes off it!
<s> We had a description of the suspect.
<s> No. No...
<s> Of course.
<s> Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
<s> Chinatown street gang.
<s> -- The Nazi he knifed?
<s> -- Yeah?
<s> I feel much better now.
<s> 1530 Rivington Street.
<s> What's Art Esparza?
<s> Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
<s> Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
<s> "...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
<s> Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
<s> Nothing has. But that's all changing.
<s> "Painted"?
<s> By trusting me. Shit, man...
<s> Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
<s> That's big of you, Bob.
<s> Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
<s> The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
<s> -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
<s> -- What trial?
<s> Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
<s> She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
<s> Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
<s> What was?
<s> Stanley, I heard all about it.
<s> Tell me about the letter.
<s> Someone else has it now.
<s> Did she ever mention any friends?
<s> Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
<s> Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
<s> It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
<s> I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
<s> Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
<s> When?
<s> He probably wanted to drive over.
<s> Okay, I suppose I should go home.
<s> No, you're the muffin.
<s> WE got it back, that's all.
<s> I can't help you there.
<s> And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
<s> Fill 'er up.
<s> Yep...  Yes...  It is.
<s> Who would do that?
<s> What does Bob say?
<s> But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
<s> He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
<s> I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
<s> I'm not.
<s> I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
<s> What? She asked about my father?
<s> Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
<s> How can I be together if I'm not together?
<s> I understand.
<s> A friend from school.
<s> No.
<s> NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
<s> Look at this finger here.
<s> Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
<s> Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
<s> That's right.
<s> Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
<s> Yes.
<s> Very good.
<s> The man's an ambulance chaser...
<s> Yes.
<s> How did you settle on the amount?
<s> I wouldn't do it.
<s> Yes.
<s> I...
<s> Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
<s> Nothing further, your Honor.
<s> Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> Yes.
<s> What did these people do when her heart stopped?
<s> 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
<s> I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
<s> You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
<s> There's nothing they can do to me.
<s> Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
<s> No. No. Thank you. You go home.
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
<s> She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
<s> Right. Who called?
<s> I understand.
<s> I did.
<s> And what are you? A cop?
<s> Yes. It was, actually.
<s> They, uh, they got to my witness.
<s> I've got to work.
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> If I don't 'grow up...'
<s> If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
<s> I've got nothing to say to you.
<s> Nothing happened.
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
<s> It's locked.
<s> ...I know. I went...
<s> I'm going to see you get that chance.
<s> ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
<s> I'm going to help her.
<s> What?
<s> I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What did she do?
<s> Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
<s> I don't want a mistrial.
<s> In New York?
<s> You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
<s> We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
<s> Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
<s> All right - I've seen enough!
<s> But I think I know where she'll be....
<s> Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
<s> They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
<s> I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
<s> It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
<s> Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
<s> How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
<s> It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
<s> Right.
<s> I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
<s> Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
<s> I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
<s> Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
<s> Welcome to California!
<s> I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
<s> Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
<s> I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
<s> 48 hours.  Back before you know it.
<s> Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
<s> Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
<s> He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
<s> I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
<s> A story?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
<s> Yeah...how'd you know?
<s> Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
<s> Yes.
<s> Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
<s> No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
<s> I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
<s> But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
<s> Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
<s> Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
<s> You miss him.
<s> I am about this.
<s> He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
<s> Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
<s> Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
<s> I didn't know sir.
<s> Fifteen.
<s> Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
<s> Okay.
<s> No, I can't.
<s> My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
<s> Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> What was that?
<s> That's not why he's sending me.
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe it's an air raid.
<s> Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
<s> I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
<s> Come on man, what'd they look like?
<s> Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
<s> He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
<s> I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
<s> Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
<s> He's a big boy.
<s> No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
<s> We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
<s> Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
<s> I figured it out.
<s> If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
<s> Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
<s> No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
<s> What?
<s> No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
<s> About anything.
<s> No.
<s> You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> Yes, I was.
<s> Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
<s> ... Absolutely not.
<s> Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
<s> How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
<s> I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
<s> We don't have no paper bags.
<s> No way... GET OUT!!!
<s> Fuck me.
<s> Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
<s> Ready for another?
<s> What's that?
<s> Forty bucks...
<s> Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
<s> That's right... Take one of these.
<s> What's the name of it?
<s> You say it's straight ahead a mile?
<s> Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
<s> Hasta siempre.
<s> Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
<s> No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
<s> Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
<s> You ain't actin', mama.
<s> Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
<s> It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
<s> But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
<s> I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
<s> I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
<s> Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
<s> You tell the boy who knocked you up?
<s> Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
<s> Hell, peanut...
<s> Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
<s> What's that?
<s> What'd you say to her?
<s> Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
<s> You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
<s> It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
<s> Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
<s> Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
<s> Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
<s> Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
<s> We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
<s> It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
<s> He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
<s> Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
<s> It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
<s> Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
<s> One bad car accident...
<s> You think she's gonna make it?
<s> I'll come along.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Lula, I got to get some sleep.
<s> Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
<s> It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
<s> HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
<s> You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
<s> I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
<s> Lula's gone off with Sailor.
<s> I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
<s> What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
<s> Yes... Get rid of him.
<s> That's your business... I don't care how.
<s> NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
<s> Shoot him.
<s> Santos... No... Please, Santos...
<s> No... But...
<s> Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
<s> So?
<s> I didn't see nothin'...
<s> Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
<s> Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
<s> Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
<s> Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
<s> No. Not yet he isn't.
<s> I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
<s> Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
<s> And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
<s> Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
<s> Competence.
<s> I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
<s> Ye-es?
<s> Find the jacket.
<s> First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
<s> That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
<s> Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
<s> I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
<s> Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
<s> How long have you been smoking marijuana?
<s> She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
<s> They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
<s> Really?
<s> Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
<s> I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
<s> So where have you been staying?
<s> Your aunt?
<s> Kinship.
<s> That's right. That one.
<s> How can you tell?
<s> Because of my coat?
<s> Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
<s> Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
<s> Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
<s> James'll know about George Sanders.
<s> I thank you.
<s> I would if I knew where I was taking him.
<s> Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
<s> I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
<s> She's left before...
<s> No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
<s> Nothing. I think I twisted my --
<s> No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
<s> It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
<s> Are you sure you parked it there?
<s> Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
<s> And you're old.
<s> It didn't come up.
<s> Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
<s> What's that?
<s> It's Grady, Walter.
<s> Sara. I'm in love with her.
<s> Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
<s> Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
<s> I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
<s> That's weird.
<s> The perpetrator.
<s> Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
<s> Just a few then. The big ones.
<s> I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
<s> No shit.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sure.
<s> Why not?
<s> I have friends.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Why's that?
<s> Lovers' quarrel?
<s> How come?
<s> It sounds like you were banished.
<s> Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
<s> Yes?
<s> Does he?
<s> I don't mind.
<s> The job's okay.
<s> No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
<s> What?
<s> A diary?
<s> Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
<s> Reflect.
<s> You think reflection is good.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> I'm still thinking about it.
<s> Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
<s> I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
<s> Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> What?
<s> The worst?
<s> How young?
<s> You don't really --
<s> Their power. They seduce me.
<s> Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
<s> You never asked them about it?
<s> I think it's a fucking good idea.
<s> Fine.
<s> What's it look like?
<s> Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
<s> I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
<s> Piece of cake, baby.
<s> Where're you?
<s> We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
<s> I'm alright, I'm dealing.
<s> Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
<s> That must be it.
<s> I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
<s> Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
<s> I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
<s> Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
<s> Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
<s> Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
<s> We've only got one suit.
<s> Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
<s> Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
<s> Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
<s> That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
<s> It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
<s> You watch yourself.
<s> Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
<s> What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
<s> You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
<s> That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
<s> Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
<s> He's hallucinating badly.
<s> What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
<s> And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
<s> This one is gorgeous.
<s> No, Dad, it isn't.
<s> Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
<s> All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, very much so.
<s> Yes, maybe that is better.
<s> Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
<s> It takes even less.
<s> But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
<s> What! Get married?
<s> So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
<s> So, you wonder why?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
<s> Aren't you going to change?
<s> Why?
<s> Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
<s> Good night. Tell me that you love me.
<s> Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
<s> To do what?
<s> But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
<s> What do you mean by sensible?
<s> It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
<s> Ask her.
<s> But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
<s> I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
<s> No, not like this one.
<s> Good. Then I'll meet you there.
<s> Through someone else?
<s> One of the other Sisters?
<s> Oh my dear child.
<s> In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
<s> I burnt them.
<s> They were stained.
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> It's not my time of month.
<s> Everyone.
<s> Oh, yes!
<s> No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
<s> Yes.
<s> Did it hurt?
<s> Is that where they say it came from... ?
<s> Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
<s> I can't have them any more.
<s> No.
<s> She'd get angry.
<s> Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
<s> Not my fault.
<s> I can't.
<s> ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
<s> And then...
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> It came out of me.
<s> Because I was afraid.
<s> Because I wasn't worthy.
<s> It grew.
<s> What do you feel?
<s> Yes.
<s> He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
<s> Of course you do. Who was it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
<s> Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
<s> Sister...
<s> Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
<s> Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
<s> You got to be crazy.
<s> I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
<s> I can get you new evidence next week.
<s> Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
<s> I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
<s> Obviously there was.
<s> But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
<s> I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
<s> ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
<s> And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
<s> Aquittal.
<s> The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
<s> I don't think I care to know.
<s> Because I didn't know... 
<s> You just said...
<s> Hand rolled.
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Listen to her singing.
<s> Would it stop you if I did?
<s> NO... no... I said leave her alone.
<s> One that will ask the questions you want asked.
<s> But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
<s> If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I didn't guess until it was too late.
<s> Oh, don't be ridiculous.
<s> The scandal...
<s> I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
<s> Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
<s> Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
<s> Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
<s> Are you now?
<s> How about Ding Dong?
<s> I'm a deserter, too.
<s> Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
<s> Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
<s> Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
<s> No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
<s> No. I don't.
<s> I'll have a bash.
<s> Have I said something amiss?
<s> Now what's that supposed to mean?
<s> Wake up!
<s> He comes from a large family.
<s> Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
<s> Oh, sorry I spoke.
<s> Is it ... is it, really?
<s> Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
<s> You can learn from books.
<s> Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
<s> Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
<s> Oh ... I dunno.
<s> I'm not wrong.
<s> Nothing good.
<s> Hello.
<s> Why do you always use your left hand?
<s> So's mine.
<s> Can't he? He's done it, son!
<s> Please, can I have one to surge with?
<s> It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
<s> Is it? Is it really?
<s> Aah, shurrup, misery!
<s> Oh, leave off!!!
<s> Don't start. Look.
<s> Clever.  George.
<s> Shurrup, cheerful.
<s> And they want me?
<s> Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
<s> Oh, anything you say, Paul.
<s> Hell, we're equipped --
<s> No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
<s> Looks like a derelict.
<s> Take a look.
<s> No, I want to go in.
<s> I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
<s> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<s> A voice transmission.
<s> It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
<s> Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
<s> Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
<s> Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
<s> The water will still recycle.
<s> What?
<s> Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<s> Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
<s> It's eating a hole in the floor!
<s> We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
<s> Boy, that's terrific.
<s> I'll come with you.
<s> How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
<s> The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
<s> Sounds like a rough one.
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> I've completely lost their signal.
<s> The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
<s> We're not going anywhere.
<s> We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
<s> Oh... God...
<s> Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
<s> It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
<s> We sure need this flamethrower.
<s> Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
<s> Feast your eyes.
<s> You lead.
<s> My signal's fading.
<s> Sun will be down in a minute.
<s> Can you see anything?
<s> Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
<s> We're going into the freezers now.
<s> Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
<s> Let's get moving with this net.
<s> Look --
<s> About four hours.
<s> Turn on navigation lights.
<s> Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
<s> Good!  Moisture content?
<s> Found what?
<s> What killed it?
<s> It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
<s> Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
<s> Up one kilometer, Jay.
<s> Even simple.
<s> I guess we open the door and net it.
<s> Go ahead, Jay.
<s> ... More spores coming.
<s> That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
<s> Yeah... I forgot.
<s> What did it do to you?
<s> Better tell the boss.
<s> A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
<s> Keep trying!
<s> I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
<s> How?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
<s> Sounds great.
<s> Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
<s> And before that?
<s> Check out the tent.
<s> I call myself Phoebe.
<s> Please do.
<s> Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
<s> I believe I will.
<s> Just like that.
<s> Are you that sure of tomorrow?
<s> Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
<s> Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
<s> I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
<s> Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
<s> I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
<s> Yes, Addison.
<s> It's the same thing, isn't it?
<s> You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
<s> We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
<s> And too many of them are produced.
<s> Margo.
<s> That's nice.
<s> Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
<s> Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
<s> I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
<s> Call me when you get in...
<s> A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
<s> How is Eve? Okay?
<s> It won't play.
<s> For instance - you!
<s> I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
<s> If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
<s> The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
<s> Don't calm down.
<s> I'll say.
<s> But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
<s> Groom.
<s> A married lady.
<s> I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
<s> Also Addison deWitt.
<s> I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
<s> Of course not.
<s> So am I.
<s> You're quite a girl.
<s> Behind in your dues? How much?
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> I'll just pick up the broken glass.
<s> I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
<s> Oh, no. I see the play.
<s> Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
<s> Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
<s> Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
<s> I'm not crying.
<s> Something most important you can do.
<s> "Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
<s> I'd do much more - for a part that good.
<s> Of course it is.
<s> The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
<s> When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
<s> There's the script to go back to the Guild-
<s> - and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
<s> It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
<s> Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> With tears.
<s> That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
<s> In a minute...
<s> Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
<s> - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
<s> Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
<s> Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
<s> Eve?
<s> I'm beginning to catch up.
<s> The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
<s> Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
<s> Not much.
<s> Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
<s> That was way back...
<s> ... Among so many quiet qualities.
<s> It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
<s> Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
<s> Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
<s> You know, she probably means well, after all...
<s> How about me what?
<s> The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
<s> Answer my question!
<s> --what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
<s> --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
<s> Hmm.
<s> --a spy, you mean?
<s> I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
<s> --you do?--with access to records?
<s> For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
<s> And I'm a Republican.
<s> When?
<s> Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
<s> We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
<s> Maybe we are...
<s> --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
<s> --according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
<s> --to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
<s> This?  Naw...
<s> --Teddy Kennedy?
<s> I'm so glad.
<s> They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
<s> It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
<s> --so?
<s> --that was awhile ago--
<s> If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
<s> Where are your bills, Carl?
<s> Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
<s> I don't know what they'd do to me.
<s> Which people?
<s> --omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
<s> 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
<s> He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
<s> OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
<s> Look, I told you inside--
<s> You're a lawyer and you're here--
<s> A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
<s> Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
<s> If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
<s> I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
<s> Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
<s> Good God!
<s> Security consultant.
<s> Nobody ever had too much.
<s> --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
<s> --well, what if your boys get it wrong--
<s> That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
<s> I did all right on McCord.
<s> The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
<s> Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
<s> Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
<s> Could develop.
<s> --go over your sources again--
<s> Absolutely.
<s> No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
<s> Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
<s> Thanks coach.
<s> I'm not good in math.
<s> Single malt?
<s> Neither did I!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Charming.
<s> You can call me Oz.
<s> You can't sing at the competition.
<s> No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
<s> Then don't.
<s> Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
<s> Sure.
<s> Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
<s> Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
<s> Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
<s> Yeah, that's right.
<s> Sorry, I thought you were dead.
<s> You fuckin' rule!
<s> Nothing!
<s> Okay, well that about covers it.
<s> It's not what it looks like!
<s> Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
<s> Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
<s> Okay!
<s> Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
<s> So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
<s> So do I, Kev.
<s> Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
<s> You've got something going?
<s> I thought so.
<s> Okay.
<s> Nadia, I can't --
<s> Kevin, this is serious!
<s> Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
<s> Okay, don't stop.
<s> How?
<s> Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
<s> So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
<s> Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
<s> Once, in church, dude.
<s> How the hell do you know all these random songs?
<s> Observe.
<s> He didn't?
<s> Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
<s> Doing what?
<s> Also like sex with my wife.
<s> Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
<s> AHHHHHHH!
<s> Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
<s> Andy!
<s> Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
<s> Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
<s> I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
<s> That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
<s> Where?
<s> All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
<s> Really.
<s> Andy...
<s> Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
<s> And you call me a moron...
<s> If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
<s> Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
<s> Oh no... no....
<s> This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
<s> You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
<s> Why the fuck would I do that?
<s> What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
<s> It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
<s> That's McDermott, but yeah.
<s> No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
<s> I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
<s> But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
<s> Allo?
<s> Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
<s> Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
<s> Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
<s> Okay. So maybe you were right.
<s> What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
<s> I was showing Sonya something . . .
<s> Get on! Anastasia, get on!
<s> Then come find me.
<s> I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
<s> Yes, your highness.
<s> I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
<s> Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
<s> I was all out of dynamite!
<s> It's the best fork of all
<s> Sad?
<s> Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
<s> I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
<s> No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
<s> You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
<s> Yes, you do. You do.
<s> Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
<s> You'd lose your security deposit?
<s> What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
<s> She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
<s> We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
<s> Ah! Let us begin!
<s> You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
<s> No. Empress, you --
<s> Young	man, I...
<s> M'mm.
<s> Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
<s> Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
<s> L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
<s> Tsch.
<s> Well, stop listening to him.
<s> You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
<s> Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
<s> What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
<s> Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
<s> Oooh! Here! Here!
<s> Get him!
<s> Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
<s> Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
<s> Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
<s> Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
<s> 'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
<s> 'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
<s> Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
<s> No, so help me.
<s> you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
<s> No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay. Yeah.
<s> As Balzac said...
<s> M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
<s> H'm?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
<s> Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
<s> Mine.
<s> M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
<s> Are yuh?
<s> Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
<s> Yeah?
<s> That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
<s> Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
<s> I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
<s> I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
<s> I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
<s> snow shovel or anything or something.
<s> That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
<s> Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
<s> Oh! My God! 
<s> How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
<s> Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
<s> I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
<s> I'm cool.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
<s> You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
<s> Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
<s> Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
<s> "Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
<s> I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
<s> Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
<s> Oswald and ghosts.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
<s> It's a narrow view.
<s> Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
<s> Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
<s> Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
<s> Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
<s> I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
<s> V.P.L.?
<s> Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
<s> Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
<s> I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
<s> No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
<s> We're gonna operate together.
<s> Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
<s> She was stealing.
<s> Who's persecuting? She stole!
<s> Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
<s> Oh, you remember her, Annie.
<s> I just have time to get the, uh-
<s> I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
<s> Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
<s> Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
<s> Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
<s> You're fucking desperate.
<s> One guess.
<s> The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
<s> Who, Sally?
<s> How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
<s> You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
<s> This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
<s> To dander.  Otis.
<s> Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
<s> So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
<s> I love her too, Joe.
<s> Anymore.
<s> You really need to be fucked.
<s> Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
<s> Anytime, sport.
<s> Beats a lawsuit.
<s> Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
<s> Hardly...
<s> You can never be too early or too thin.
<s> And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
<s> It's taken care of.
<s> You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
<s> It's ecstasy, Sal.
<s> Well he can't have gone far.
<s> This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
<s> It's a novel.
<s> Hello?  Last birthday was?
<s> This is insanity.  Sally...
<s> Everybody hates the messenger.
<s> Okay.
<s> Ah...
<s> Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
<s> But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
<s> Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
<s> God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
<s> I'll be your best friend.
<s> We're way past inappropriate.
<s> A lot of cakes.
<s> And he doesn't smoke?
<s> I like you.
<s> Sorry?
<s> Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
<s> Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
<s> I'm sure you understand.
<s> You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
<s> Oh?
<s> No, no thanks.
<s> If he were still alive, maybe.
<s> Very.
<s> Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
<s> She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
<s> You see, that's worse.
<s> Like your business managers?
<s> I wasn't finished.
<s> I never like to talk about my work.
<s> Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
<s> From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
<s> Hmm.  Where are my kids?
<s> Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
<s> Why are you doing this?
<s> Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
<s> This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
<s> I'm new...I was born yesterday.
<s> That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
<s> Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
<s> You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
<s> Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
<s> Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
<s> No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
<s> Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
<s> <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
<s> I'm the Princess, aren't I?
<s> Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
<s> Don't get all sappy about it!
<s> I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
<s> Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
<s> Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
<s> Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
<s> Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
<s> Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
<s> Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
<s> Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
<s> I can't think of any.
<s> Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
<s> From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
<s> Oh!
<s> Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
<s> So I see.
<s> Cheers.
<s> No -- I like it.
<s> Why?
<s> The mirror -- it's broken.
<s> You don't want me here --
<s> I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
<s> That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
<s> Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
<s> Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
<s> Sure.  What's that funny smell?
<s> A what?
<s> Might as well go all the way.
<s> I don't?
<s> Oh.
<s> For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
<s> What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
<s> Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
<s> Swap them? For what?
<s> You too, sir.
<s> Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
<s> Sir?
<s> Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
<s> I got kicked in the head, too.
<s> The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
<s> I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
<s> Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
<s> All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
<s> What does he mean, accident?
<s> You?
<s> Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
<s> Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
<s> Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
<s> Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
<s> I have a vague idea.
<s> I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
<s> I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
<s> Kubelik -- with two k's.
<s> I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
<s> All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
<s> Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
<s> Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
<s> Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
<s> It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
<s> Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
<s> No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
<s> Come on, Fran.
<s> What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
<s> -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
<s> Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
<s> Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
<s> Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
<s> Important?
<s> Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
<s> Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
<s> Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
<s> He wouldn't.
<s> I told you -- with my mother.
<s> Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
<s> What gives?
<s> That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
<s> Captain Willard -- go ahead.
<s> Well --
<s> We have a lot of pride in our unit --
<s> Moonby. Got any Winstons?
<s> Part.
<s> We do.
<s> They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
<s> I don't believe you --
<s> That we're dumber than we look.
<s> Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
<s> You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
<s> Who knows what's up there?
<s> I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
<s> Which way? Right or left?
<s> One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
<s> He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
<s> I wonder if that was the same copter.
<s> Would he remember you ?
<s> Anyone got a cigarette.
<s> Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
<s> Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
<s> Terminate with extreme prejudice.
<s> Charlie?
<s> He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
<s> This gentleman or myself ?
<s> I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
<s> About what ?
<s> We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
<s> Do you know that jungle?
<s> What about an American named Kurtz?
<s> Your daughter.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
<s> Who?
<s> The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
<s> What do you mean, Colonel?
<s> You know you're right.
<s> Oh Captain, that is so true.
<s> I'm taking you back.
<s> You get to know each other pretty well out there.
<s> His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
<s> No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
<s> That's me.
<s> We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> I should be checking on the boat.
<s> Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
<s> Wait 'til I'm across!
<s> 150  CONTINUED:
<s> I just want this over with.
<s> 28   CONTINUED:
<s> That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
<s> I don't want to talk any more.
<s> -- Corbett's a killer.
<s> Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
<s> Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
<s> Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
<s> Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
<s> Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
<s> -- Permanently?
<s> Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
<s> Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
<s> New to the country, kid?
<s> Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
<s> -- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
<s> That's right.  You're not.
<s> We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
<s> It could blow over tomorrow, too.
<s> You know Meyerling?
<s> How many do you see?
<s> You got one?
<s> I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
<s> Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
<s> I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
<s> What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
<s> -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
<s> Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
<s> I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
<s> Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> That's what we should've done in the first place.
<s> Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
<s> Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
<s> I'm right fuckin' here with you.
<s> Ease off.  We do this my way.
<s> Musta never got a chance to -more-
<s> Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
<s> I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
<s> You all set here?
<s> How do you know about my mother?
<s> Note. Put it in the note.
<s> To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
<s> Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
<s> Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
<s> It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
<s> Welcome.
<s> Nonsense!
<s> No.
<s> Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
<s> That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
<s> 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
<s> I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
<s> I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
<s> Good night.
<s> Stop staring. Do a vase.
<s> Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
<s> I'll take care of myself --
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> What are you trying to do to me?
<s> If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
<s> Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
<s> Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
<s> You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
<s> You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
<s> Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
<s> See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
<s> No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
<s> Just move on. No one here killed him.
<s> What's he look like?
<s> Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
<s> How're you doing?
<s> Maybe this can wait.
<s> Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
<s> Come on, sweetheart...
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
<s> Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
<s> No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
<s> What is this?
<s> What?
<s> It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
<s> Tachlinkov.
<s> After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
<s> We go around once.
<s> What?  What's okay?
<s> It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> The contract?
<s> We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
<s> One hour per man.
<s> What?  How did you know I had a cat?
<s> Yeah?
<s> What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
<s> Turn off the engine.
<s> No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
<s> He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
<s> We don't have a choice.
<s> It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
<s> It's not the same, is it?
<s> Why?
<s> How old were you?
<s> Ahhhh...
<s> Why not?
<s> No.  Something honest.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> Sorry.
<s> The beach?  It was nice.
<s> Taiwan.
<s> Fine.
<s> Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
<s> Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
<s> You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
<s> We split the money?
<s> You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
<s> No.
<s> Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
<s> It can be.
<s> When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> You mean quit?
<s> That's correct.
<s> A coke, if they have it?
<s> I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
<s> What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
<s> Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
<s> You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
<s> Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
<s> No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
<s> Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
<s> This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
<s> Care to elaborate?
<s> It's big, right Jahn?
<s> We could make a run for it?
<s> Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
<s> He was an electrician?
<s> Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
<s> Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
<s> Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
<s> A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
<s> I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
<s> 'cause you stink of booze.
<s> Can you do the lock on it?
<s> But how did the wall get here?
<s> Yeah, I'll take some.
<s> See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
<s> We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
<s> Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
<s> It looks new, they might miss one or two.
<s> Am I late?
<s> No, not yet.
<s> I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
<s> He's lying! I am.
<s> So I hear.
<s> WE gotta think of something.
<s> I could try and get a Western lawyer.
<s> Did you see anything in the files?
<s> Siberia.
<s> Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
<s> Here!
<s> Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
<s> Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
<s> Yes.
<s> They didn't look like medical files to me.
<s> Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
<s> Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
<s> Sure. Excellent.
<s> I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
<s> I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
<s> What? You are crazy!
<s> Don't worry it's okay!
<s> We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
<s> Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
<s> Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
<s> And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
<s> Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
<s> Sure, I've done it easily.
<s> Yep, it's all yours.
<s> How?
<s> Am I invited?
<s> Guests.
<s> No!
<s> I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
<s> Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
<s> See you brought one of the patients with you too.
<s> It's time to go home, Holly.
<s> Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
<s> Can we talk in your office?
<s> All the more reason to eliminate him.
<s> Heart be still.
<s> Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
<s> I'll tell her you were here.
<s> You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
<s> -- I like the car I have.
<s> You're fine like that, Mom.
<s> Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
<s> What kind of a man are you, son?
<s> Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
<s> 'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
<s> 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
<s> Don't bother!
<s> I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
<s> Don't you?
<s> I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
<s> You don't believe in anything?
<s> Belinda's a very jealous person.
<s> And that would ruin your reputation how?
<s> Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<s> What?
<s> We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
<s> No.
<s> Where?
<s> Twice a year.
<s> Mars.
<s> You planned this --
<s> What about your father?
<s> Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
<s> I used to like yogurt.
<s> That I want you to take me home.
<s> Lower. Same page.
<s> Dad --
<s> Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
<s> In there.
<s> I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
<s> She did. It was you.
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
<s> Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
<s> But he didn't ask me.
<s> Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
<s> You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
<s> How are you?
<s> Learn anything?
<s> Well... yeah...
<s> Why?
<s> No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
<s> Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
<s> What?
<s> Home, school, here... 
<s> AM or PM?
<s> Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
<s> Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
<s> You were ringing the doorbell!
<s> Well, it was there.
<s> You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
<s> Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
<s> Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
<s> Well, he's gone.
<s> She plays the clarinet, too.
<s> I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
<s> I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
<s> Tom...
<s> What'd you come out here for?
<s> Is that right?
<s> For coming onto my property... With a gun.
<s> Yeah. I can imagine.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Nah, I got me a job.
<s> Well, I got homework.
<s> But it would hurt.
<s> Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
<s> We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
<s> How about over here?
<s> Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Stay as long as you like.
<s> Just gimme a chance.
<s> Who're you?
<s> You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
<s> Then that's it!
<s> Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
<s> And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
<s> Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
<s> I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
<s> I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
<s> Where's the professor?
<s> At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
<s> Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
<s> Don't shoot!
<s> John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
<s> Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
<s> My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
<s> Who?
<s> Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
<s> I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
<s> Penny--?!  Are you all right?
<s> Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
<s> John Whorfin will kill us!
<s> Damn John Whorfin--!
<s> No, sir.  I think the flint...
<s> Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
<s> Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
<s> Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
<s> I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
<s> Drown all those rascals...
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> ...Who?
<s> I...
<s> W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
<s> Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
<s> Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started
<s> I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
<s> Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
<s> Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
<s> Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
<s> Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
<s> Well, I can tell you some stories 
<s> Seen a doctor?
<s> Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
<s> Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Charlie, I'm in trouble  something horrible's happened  I've gotta call the police...
<s> Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
<s> I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
<s> But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
<s> She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
<s> Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy  like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
<s> Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
<s> Because you DON'T LISTEN!
<s> That's okay, that's okay, that's okay  that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing  although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
<s> Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
<s> Yes sir, they 
<s> With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
<s> You want my partner to kiss your ass?
<s> He's a little funny in the head.
<s> Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
<s> All of which he's now missin'.
<s> Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
<s> I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
<s> You two have some sick sex thing?
<s> Excellent picture.
<s> Mr. Lipnik, please 
<s> Home. Watching TV.
<s> Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
<s> I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
<s> No.
<s> No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
<s> Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
<s> No, Nick, please --
<s> Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
<s> She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
<s> I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
<s> About a year and a half.
<s> I quit.
<s> A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
<s> I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
<s> I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
<s> What's it about?
<s> I'll meet you there.
<s> She's seen everything before.
<s> Did you like her to watch?
<s> When?
<s> Did you miss me?
<s> Come over here and tell me no.
<s> What are you researching?
<s> What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
<s> We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> No thank you.
<s> What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
<s> No.
<s> I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
<s> The usual -- a girlfriend.
<s> I hope I helped you out.
<s> No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
<s> Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
<s> Somethin', though.
<s> She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
<s> I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
<s> I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
<s> You're looking for Catherine, not me.
<s> Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
<s> No.
<s> It was an accident.
<s> Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
<s> Did you check all four years?
<s> Really. Huh. Too bad.
<s> Let's get out of here.
<s> Do you ever get sick of it?
<s> Ignorant art?
<s> That's good. At least they're interested.
<s> Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
<s> Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
<s> Do you still love her?
<s> I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
<s> That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
<s> No.
<s> Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
<s> I can get ten.
<s> It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
<s> Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
<s> Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
<s> Yes, but as a black painter 
<s> Not black.
<s> No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
<s> Really?
<s> Very well.
<s> Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
<s> What's wrong with you today?
<s> Willie Mays.
<s> I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
<s> Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
<s> For real?
<s> I guess you did.
<s> You don't have any fucking money..
<s> Well thanks!
<s> I hadn't thought about it.
<s> Staten Island would be ok.
<s> Think so?
<s> You mean babies with you?
<s> Hi.
<s> How is he?
<s> I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
<s> What's his name?
<s> Sure. I'd be glad to.
<s> They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
<s> Wanna Mac?
<s> Have a Mac.
<s> Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
<s> No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
<s> You don't even know me. I want real respect.
<s> Jean Michel Basquiat.
<s> So what?
<s> Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
<s> Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
<s> No, actually I feel worse.
<s> You'll never guess.
<s> Yes, I suppose that we did.
<s> Treat to be here.
<s> And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
<s> Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
<s> If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
<s> Y'mean take off our costumes?
<s> I'm not scared of you, Max.
<s> Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
<s> Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
<s> Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
<s> No, just give you a splitting headache.
<s> Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
<s> Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
<s> I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
<s> No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
<s> And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
<s> I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
<s> Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
<s> Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
<s> Pheromones?
<s> I hate being lectured.
<s> We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
<s> I can make it.
<s> Can he save her?
<s> A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
<s> She knows who we are.
<s> Maybe he melted.
<s> Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
<s> We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
<s> I knew you could handle it.
<s> Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
<s> I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
<s> I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
<s> I think they're getting worse.
<s> I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
<s> What?
<s> No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
<s> Big house. How many rooms?
<s> It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
<s> Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
<s> Slanta.
<s> On occasion. Usually at night.
<s> She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
<s> I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
<s> Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
<s> I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
<s> Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
<s> Never heard of a double-cross?
<s> You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
<s> Here. Get a good seat.
<s> Don't bogart that 'trode.
<s> About what?
<s> Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
<s> You're a genius.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
<s> ... Where are you taking me?
<s> You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
<s> Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
<s> You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
<s> What is it you want?
<s> I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
<s> Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
<s> Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
<s> ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
<s> Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
<s> I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
<s> I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
<s> I suggest a nice big bomb.
<s> Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
<s> God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
<s> Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
<s> Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
<s> Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
<s> Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
<s> Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
<s> Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
<s> Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
<s> His face.  Allie, look at his face.
<s> Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
<s> Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
<s> Allie, he's not.
<s> Great. How??
<s> Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
<s> I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
<s> One.
<s> 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
<s> It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
<s> Thanks, Annie.
<s> Night.
<s> Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Isn't it?
<s> Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
<s> Great news.
<s> Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
<s> Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
<s> Quite right, sir.
<s> A car sounds sensible.
<s> Richard Burton was very good-looking.
<s> There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
<s> It's you and Mom that need to talk.
<s> Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
<s> Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
<s> Why thank you sir.
<s> NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
<s> What?
<s> What's your problem Beavis?
<s> Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
<s> Me first?
<s> Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
<s> Heh hmm heh heh.
<s> Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
<s> Uh...
<s> Huh? Huh huh.
<s> Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
<s> Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
<s> Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
<s> Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
<s> Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
<s> Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
<s> Heh heh, thanks.
<s> Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
<s> Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
<s> Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
<s> Ah, the witness?
<s> Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
<s> I see it. I don't get it.
<s> Yup. Huh huh.
<s> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
<s> Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
<s> I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
<s> Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
<s> This is going to take some time.
<s> I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
<s> <u>You</u> left me.
<s> Not really...  what's this?
<s> She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
<s> Maybe we should knock first?
<s> Little black party dresses?
<s> I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
<s> We were trying to scare your mother.
<s> We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
<s> God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
<s> Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
<s> Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
<s> W... We didn't know how to make one.
<s> Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
<s> For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
<s> You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
<s> <u>Out</u>.
<s> Our cemetery?
<s> You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
<s> It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
<s> No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
<s> Where'd they go?
<s> That's it!
<s> How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
<s> 
<s> I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
<s> There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
<s> Delia hates it.
<s> ... sheets.
<s> Otho, can you do it?
<s> Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
<s> Maybe Charles does.
<s> The attic.
<s> Their wedding clothes.
<s> ... Straight out?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
<s> To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
<s> We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
<s> It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
<s> Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
<s> Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
<s> Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
<s> No. I like this attic very much.
<s> Yes. He's a very careful driver.
<s> It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> No. I like it here.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> Yes. It's feeling much better now.
<s> Yes. I was.
<s> Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
<s> Good night, Eve.
<s> Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> I have nothing more to say.
<s> Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
<s> Yes, I do, it's very good.
<s> We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
<s> Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
<s> Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
<s> What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
<s> Yes. Chauncey is fine.
<s> Yes. That is correct.
<s> Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
<s> Yes. I like to watch very much.
<s> I can't read.
<s> What sort of bed is it?
<s> Oh. Thank you.
<s> He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. We need a very good gardener.
<s> I am a very serious gardener.
<s> Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
<s> Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
<s> I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
<s> Come now, Mr. Chance.
<s> Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
<s> I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
<s> No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
<s> Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
<s> Do you need a secretary?
<s> Hello, Sophie.
<s> Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
<s> Look, Johanna...
<s> We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
<s> I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
<s> Mr. Gardiner...
<s> Oh yeah, he's good.
<s> Malkovich!
<s> I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
<s> Please, have a seat.
<s> Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
<s> Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
<s> Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
<s> I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
<s> The iguana?
<s> I'm sorry for everything.
<s> And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
<s> Simulates?
<s> Forget it.
<s> I am a trained performer.
<s> No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
<s> The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
<s> The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
<s> Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
<s> What's he been in?
<s> So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
<s> Ha ha ha!
<s> I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
<s> Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
<s> I like that.
<s> No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
<s> The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
<s> Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
<s> You bastard!
<s> It's Craig in there, I can tell.
<s> Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
<s> I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
<s> Great then.
<s> Whatever you're having.
<s> Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
<s> No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
<s> I've got to leave Malkovich.
<s> I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
<s> I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
<s> What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
<s> Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
<s> I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
<s> I WILL PROTECT YOU.
<s> Baby, don't be like that.
<s> Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
<s> No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
<s> Yes sir
<s> Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
<s> OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
<s> No, let her rest.
<s> Mama?
<s> Was over to Baby Suggs.
<s> You sure?
<s> Better ask Paul D.
<s> Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
<s> I don't know him that well.
<s> For what?
<s> No use thinking these things now.
<s> Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
<s> Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
<s> She left me. She's gone again.
<s> Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
<s> What do you think?
<s> It's the LeBaron.
<s> Shit.
<s> Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
<s> Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
<s> Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
<s> Nothing.
<s> That is for the urn.
<s> Yeah, but we're--
<s> Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
<s> Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
<s> YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
<s> Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
<s> I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
<s> I'm shomer shabbas.
<s> Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
<s> Nancy's pretty good.
<s> Are these.
<s> Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
<s> And was there anything of value in the car?
<s> Separate incidents?
<s> Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
<s> I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
<s> The main guy, Dieter--
<s> Well--yeah, I guess--
<s> Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
<s> Maude?
<s> Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
<s> Oh?
<s> This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
<s> Am I wrong!
<s> Huh?
<s> Well, just take 't easy, man.
<s> It's your roll--
<s> My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
<s> I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
<s> What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
<s> C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
<s> Dude--
<s> Huh?
<s> Nihilists!  Jesus.
<s> Not exactly a lightweight.
<s> Look, man, did you--
<s> We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
<s> I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
<s> Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
<s> I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
<s> You know this!
<s> Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
<s> Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Dude.
<s> What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
<s> Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
<s> Help me put him back in his chair.
<s> I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
<s> He's half yours, partner.
<s> Someday.
<s> You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Fry 'em.
<s> For what?
<s> I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
<s> Either that or feeding the worms.
<s> Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
<s> You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
<s> Thought you were dead.
<s> I should think that would be obvious at this point.
<s> Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
<s> He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
<s> They've made contact with the Reapers.
<s> Scud.
<s> The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
<s> Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
<s> So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
<s> After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
<s> China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
<s> I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
<s> But I just got here --
<s> I'm sorry, I --
<s> Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
<s> He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
<s> There is no cure.
<s> He will.
<s> Like me.
<s> We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
<s> I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
<s> I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
<s> There's only one alternative to the serum.
<s> These are my people now. I'm one of them.
<s> What about the chemistry panel?
<s> No problem.
<s> Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
<s> What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
<s> You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
<s> My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
<s> Join the club.
<s> A coward too. That's why she had to go.
<s> I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
<s> Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
<s> --Christ almighty--
<s> --it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
<s> She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
<s> What is <u>this</u>?
<s> Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
<s> You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
<s> --fine, later, fine.
<s> I want to see the tapes.
<s> --bullshit!
<s> --you should get back into bed.
<s> No.
<s> You have to go.
<s> I want amphetamines.
<s> Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
<s> --fuckin' A right--
<s> --which'd be about ten bucks--
<s> No.
<s> I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
<s> --I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
<s> Heather, does that look like Domini there?
<s> How's she going to know where to--
<s> The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<s> For "James?"
<s> Anna's the witch.
<s> It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
<s> --now there.
<s> Asleep--
<s> All I need--
<s> I can't!
<s> No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
<s> What'd you say?
<s> That's why she kills children.
<s> She's off her fucking rocker--
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Yeah.
<s> --or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
<s> Who <u>is</u> this??
<s> No.
<s> I am?
<s> You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
<s> You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
<s> What?
<s> ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
<s> ...You ever get tired?
<s> I don't know. It's early... I love you.
<s> ...What do you mean?
<s> Marty.
<s> I think someone's watching.
<s> About ten years.
<s> We don't seem to be communicating--
<s> Ever durned one.
<s> Lubbock?
<s> Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
<s> I don't know. Motel... Abby--
<s> Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
<s> Ya catch any fish?
<s> Got something to show me first?
<s> It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
<s> You said the usual--
<s> Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
<s> No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
<s> I've seen a few.
<s> Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
<s> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
<s> You want to see him too, right?
<s> Alright, suit yourself.
<s> Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
<s> No. Come on.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll go then.
<s> You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
<s> What?
<s> No. What is happening?
<s> Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
<s> Don't say that.
<s> Yeah. hurry up though.
<s> Frank? .can you stand up?
<s> Sure I do.
<s> Whatiya mean?
<s> Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
<s> No thanks. what does that mean?
<s> Okay Frank.
<s> I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
<s> You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
<s> Yes.
<s> Where are they?
<s> My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
<s> I don't know. he moved away.
<s> Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
<s> Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
<s> Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
<s> Oh, okay. can I call?
<s> Look. it can wait till Sunday.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's okay. Don't worry about it.
<s> You like mysteries that much?
<s> Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
<s> Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
<s> For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
<s> Do you want the car?
<s> Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
<s> Um-hmm.
<s> That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
<s> This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
<s> You'll see for yourself.
<s> I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
<s> Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
<s> Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
<s> Something about vengance being best served cold.
<s> I see.  How much?
<s> We want some grass.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
<s> Barbara and me.  No one else.
<s> I heard.
<s> I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
<s> Oh hey, one more thing?
<s> Get me a six pack.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> Nothing.  Just a little project.
<s> Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
<s> Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
<s> Slow down, George.  Slow down.
<s> I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
<s> It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
<s> Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
<s> And Diego?
<s> I didn't come here to drink scotch.
<s> I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
<s> Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
<s> That's where you belong...
<s> That was a beautiful message.
<s> Figured what out?
<s> We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
<s> I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
<s> Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
<s> Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
<s> That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
<s> Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
<s> Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
<s> Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
<s> What's happening to us?
<s> How are you doing?
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> It's alright, Dad.
<s> Very nice.  I'll take it.
<s> Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
<s> Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
<s> Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
<s> Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
<s> Second district ...
<s> Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
<s> It's true.
<s> Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
<s> Not enough.
<s> But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
<s> Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
<s> It could've happened to anyone.
<s> What good does that do -- it's the old will?
<s> Did I say it was a natural death?
<s> That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
<s> But there's more?
<s> We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
<s> We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
<s> You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
<s> Counsel approach the bench.
<s> Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
<s> We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
<s> Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
<s> I have.
<s> No.  I haven't done it in years.
<s> No -- never.
<s> Intense.
<s> She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
<s> I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
<s> Cocaine.
<s> No -- she asked me about cocaine.
<s> No.
<s> No.  No, I don't.
<s> Chinese peony root.
<s> No.
<s> I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
<s> He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
<s> He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
<s> Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
<s> You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
<s> There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
<s> Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
<s> What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
<s> Frank -- what are you doing here?
<s> I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
<s> I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
<s> What?
<s> It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
<s> I went out on the boat.
<s> Honey.
<s> To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
<s> I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
<s> No -- you're not.
<s> Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
<s> That's crazy.
<s> That wasn't the deal.
<s> Why?
<s> -- But it's Sunday.
<s> How often do you use cocaine?
<s> You better.  Please answer the question.
<s> I'm always open to learning new things.
<s> We're supposed to go to the lake.
<s> Yes.
<s> Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
<s> It was a place to start.
<s> Sorry.
<s> What time did you leave?
<s> Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
<s> It's not that long.
<s> SO!
<s> Oh Jesus.
<s> I know. I don't understand it either.
<s> How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
<s> "... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
<s> I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
<s> Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.
<s> We got engaged.
<s> Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
<s> Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
<s> They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
<s> No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
<s> I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
<s> I want you to come.
<s> Sure.
<s> No. I can't. Not yet.
<s> It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
<s> Why?
<s> Nobody's asking you to.
<s> I sat outside and had coffee.
<s> What?
<s> Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
<s> I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
<s> You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
<s> WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
<s> What about us? What about me?
<s> How the hell should I know?
<s> Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
<s> Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
<s> Or just Hell-adjacent...
<s> Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
<s> Wh-wh-whooo?
<s> No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
<s> What?
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> Then fuck it!!!
<s> I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
<s> Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
<s> Mother!  No.
<s> I manage them.
<s> Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
<s> A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
<s> It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
<s> You were just a kid.
<s> That's the past.  It's dead.
<s> Daddy?
<s> Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
<s> And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
<s> You was just doing your job.
<s> I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
<s> But --
<s> "This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
<s> No thanks.
<s> That building?
<s> Should I?
<s> That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
<s> Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
<s> Caesar, what are we going to do?
<s> Caesar, maybe we should run --
<s> Caesar, this is crazy.
<s> You don't, you can't believe that ...
<s> Caesar, what are we going to do?
<s> Caesar, someone could see us out here.
<s> Don't tell him --
<s> Not until he has the money!
<s> Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
<s> You betrayed me!
<s> They were in a car accident.
<s> Pretty good, sir.
<s> It's all right, sir.
<s> Good idea.
<s> Lick me.
<s> Are you okay, Violet?
<s> Caesar, you still got the money?
<s> Me?  Why?
<s> Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
<s> You're doing everything yourself?
<s> He said you lost something.
<s> What do you want?
<s> You have to ask?
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
<s> What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
<s> What the fuck was it?
<s> What was it then?
<s> You think I'm lying?
<s> He hung it up.
<s> Good.
<s> Like each other?  They hate each other.
<s> Yeah, twice.
<s> He does it right in front of him.
<s> An accident.
<s> Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
<s> What happened?
<s> Pop?
<s> Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
<s> Caesar wants me to stay.
<s> I don't know what we're talking about.
<s> Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
<s> Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
<s> I'm not asking.
<s> Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
<s> ...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
<s> What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
<s> MPG Capital.
<s> 
<s> Who?  Who came?
<s> Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
<s> Thanks.
<s> That'd be great.
<s> 
<s> Oh, Jesus... 
<s> -- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
<s> -- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
<s> There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
<s> I guess.
<s> Thanks for the ride.
<s> All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
<s> ...omigod, no...
<s> -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
<s> You're wrong.  I didn't know.
<s> -- forget it --
<s> Who paid the bill?
<s> It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
<s> xxxxxx
<s> If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
<s> Not really.
<s> That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
<s> -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
<s> That's the only angle.
<s> -- I'm on it --
<s> -- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
<s> Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What do I have to do.
<s> You don't have to sing it.
<s> On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
<s> That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
<s> Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
<s> Even later.
<s> Am I?
<s> Not really, no.
<s> You got the wrong man.
<s> So how ...?
<s> You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
<s> Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
<s> Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
<s> Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
<s> If you say so.
<s> Oh.
<s> Good!
<s> What?
<s> Really.
<s> Suit me?
<s> You're joking.
<s> I thought you arrested me.
<s> "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
<s> Go away.
<s> You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
<s> Your face ... are you hurt?
<s> Information Retrieval.
<s> We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Sam Lowry.
<s> No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
<s> What is it?
<s> Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
<s> I know, I know ...!
<s> Central Services.
<s> Fixed?
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> Emergency procedures.
<s> No. Wait here.
<s> I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
<s> She say she in great pain.
<s> Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
<s> We are virgins.
<s> He flipped out.
<s> Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
<s> I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
<s> What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
<s> What?
<s> You never know.
<s> No.
<s> Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
<s> He's better, though, right?
<s> It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
<s> Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
<s> I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
<s> Maybe I should come up with you.
<s> You asked me not to come.
<s> Thanks.
<s> She's no whore, Marcus.
<s> We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
<s> Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
<s> Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
<s> Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
<s> Let me think.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Frank!
<s> Frank!
<s> I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
<s> He's drunk.
<s> Faster!
<s> You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
<s> You write this?
<s> Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
<s> You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
<s> We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
<s> Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
<s> Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
<s> I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
<s> No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
<s> Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
<s> Are you any closer to a decision?
<s> Yes.
<s> Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
<s> I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
<s> A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
<s> Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<s> I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
<s> This is important to me.
<s> Yeah -- being a basket case.
<s> Speaking.
<s> Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
<s> You didn't say anything to her?
<s> Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
<s> I understand.  I'll go with you.
<s> They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
<s> Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
<s> I'll speak to you soon
<s> Should I...
<s> Follow me.
<s> No.  Really...don't worry about it.
<s> What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
<s> No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Would it help if I got you a tutor?
<s> That actually goes on...
<s> Yes, sure.
<s> No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
<s> I trust you.
<s> So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
<s> You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
<s> What do you mean clean?
<s> George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
<s> I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
<s> Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
<s> Well, when?
<s> Good night??!
<s> He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
<s> How can you say that to me?
<s> Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
<s> Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
<s> What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
<s> I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
<s> Shh!
<s> Oh it's enough...
<s> I'll pose any way you want.
<s> Righto.
<s> Carla...
<s> Better!
<s> Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
<s> Walter!  Jeez!
<s> Yes Walter.
<s> Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
<s> You think I'm creative?
<s> Why not?!
<s> Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
<s> Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
<s> I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
<s> I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
<s> Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
<s> Didn't you hear him?
<s> I said I did, didn't I!
<s> Enough already about it - get to work!
<s> A parakeet?
<s> N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
<s> Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
<s> C-connection?
<s> NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
<s> I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
<s> Did you like it Mister Brock?
<s> Good morning Walter!
<s> Why not?
<s> I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
<s> If you see him.
<s> What's with you?
<s> You think?  Split?
<s> Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
<s> Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
<s> Hi, guys.
<s> I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
<s> Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
<s> It's the news, Buffy.
<s> Hi.
<s> I do?  I guess I do.
<s> 'Bye.
<s> Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
<s> I thought we were meeting here.
<s> I am so sure.
<s> I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
<s> But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
<s> I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
<s> You say that like it's a bad thing.
<s> Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
<s> Why don't we see a movie?
<s> Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
<s> I forgot.
<s> I have to show you.
<s> We wait for Robert to wake up.
<s> She --
<s> I have cheerleading squad.
<s> But you enjoyed it, yes?
<s> Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
<s> Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
<s> No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
<s> Oh.
<s> Try to pay attention.
<s> Five.
<s> Vampires of the world, beware.
<s> But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
<s> Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
<s> Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
<s> And where are they now?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Nicole...
<s> Hi.
<s> Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
<s> Got that.
<s> Okay, what else?
<s> Jeffrey!
<s> You want some punch?
<s> Like we don't have rights too?
<s> Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
<s> What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
<s> Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
<s> I won't be needing these anymore.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
<s> You're pulling your hips out.
<s> Aren't we all?
<s> What's so great about baseball?
<s> I heard already.
<s> I can do that, too.
<s> We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
<s> Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
<s> Never heard of 'em.
<s> Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
<s> No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
<s> Beg me again!
<s> I thought I was--
<s> God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
<s> If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
<s> I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
<s> I'm nervous--my old man's here.
<s> Let go of me!
<s> Fear and ignorance.
<s> What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
<s> From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
<s> Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
<s> Can I give you my testimony?
<s> We're getting married.
<s> We're eight and sixteen.
<s> Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
<s> It's a damn convention.
<s> Yes, you were.
<s> ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
<s> The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
<s> Yeah, yeah. I know that.
<s> ...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
<s> I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
<s> Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
<s> Well...
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
<s> You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
<s> Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
<s> And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
<s> Four aces, Doc.
<s> Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah.
<s> And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
<s> Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
<s> You never - ?
<s> Yeah.
<s> She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
<s> It's me.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
<s> Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
<s> Yeah, refill'd be great.
<s> What can I do?
<s> Ace, listen to me.
<s> She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
<s> Nice to see you, Senator.
<s> I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
<s> I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
<s> No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
<s> You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
<s> I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
<s> It's nice isn't it?
<s> The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
<s> Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
<s> Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
<s> Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
<s> Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
<s> Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
<s> ...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
<s> It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
<s> Okay?
<s> You're not takin' Amy.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> What if he won't stop?
<s> I can back him off.
<s> You understand? What? Let you go?
<s> Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
<s> You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
<s> What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
<s> You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
<s> Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
<s> Eight children! 
<s> That's amazing.
<s> The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
<s> Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
<s> I really think you're -
<s> A record of the arrests...
<s> Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
<s> What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
<s> I understand.
<s> Please.
<s> Pitch-black?! It -
<s> Hey!
<s> Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
<s> I did - I didn't -
<s> He's gone?
<s> But I'm just trying to leave.
<s> I'll take care of it, Remo.
<s> It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
<s> I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
<s> He's good. He's fine.
<s> Mm.
<s> But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
<s> Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
<s> So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
<s> No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
<s> What about my money?
<s> Thank you. Very nice.
<s> Ginger, honey.
<s> Here.
<s> God, I'm telling you, they're out!
<s> Get up.
<s> Hey. This is Shelly.
<s> Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
<s> You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
<s> No, no, no, no!
<s> Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
<s> Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
<s> Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
<s> Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
<s> Then do it the way you want.
<s> I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
<s> It's okay. Let her go.
<s> Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
<s> Guilty. I am.
<s> Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
<s> There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
<s> Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
<s> I'm sure.
<s> Uh Brock, today you are without me...
<s> I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
<s> A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
<s> She has a real spirit.
<s> I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
<s> Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
<s> I know.
<s> What's the name of your child's best friend?
<s> What's the good news?
<s> Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
<s> Uh. "Thanks?"
<s> What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
<s> Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
<s> But I'm blind.
<s> Yes, Mother. Dear.
<s> It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
<s> I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
<s> This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
<s> I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
<s> I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
<s> This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
<s> No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
<s> Or relieve me of it later.
<s> Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
<s> Not this minute.
<s> It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
<s> There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
<s> I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
<s> I realize you don't want to be involved.
<s> No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
<s> They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
<s> Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
<s> They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
<s> Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
<s> Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
<s> Another minute.
<s> A woman?
<s> Sometimes I paint.
<s> Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
<s> That makes two of us.
<s> I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
<s> I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
<s> Don't talk.  Don't talk!
<s> Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
<s> Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
<s> I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
<s> Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
<s> Hand me the phone.
<s> There isn't any such person.
<s> Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
<s> They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
<s> You knew about me.
<s> L.A.P.D.
<s> The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
<s> I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
<s> Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
<s> I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
<s> Stop talking like that!
<s> We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
<s> The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
<s> Naturally.
<s> Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
<s> That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
<s> Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
<s> I don't want it.
<s> I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
<s> You're up on your details, aren't you?
<s> Got a phone in that van?
<s> Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
<s> You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
<s> I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
<s> Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
<s> Are you trying to panic the women?
<s> Better reassure him.
<s> Call me "Nels."
<s> And if you ditch us we get zilch.
<s> The fuck I will!
<s> Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
<s> Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
<s> Mind if I have a look?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
<s> Then why doesn't she?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> How?
<s> See what, Dil?
<s> She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
<s> Saw it, Dil.
<s> You heard me --
<s> Cunt.
<s> Fuck off, Dave.
<s> Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
<s> What?
<s> The accent, I suppose.
<s> Jimmy?
<s> Must be.
<s> Did you do that to him?
<s> Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
<s> You say that like a gentleman.
<s> No...
<s> Dil --
<s> Where?
<s> So they do know.
<s> Probably.
<s> Don't be cruel.
<s> Yes.
<s> More than that.
<s> It's a secret.
<s> Yes.
<s> For me.
<s> Look on it like a honeymoon.
<s> Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
<s> You mean that?
<s> Prescription. For my condition.
<s> You knew which man?
<s> You knew my Jody?
<s> No.
<s> Fergus.
<s> Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
<s> There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Leave me alone, Jude.
<s> He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
<s> Yes.
<s> No way, Jude. I'm out.
<s> Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
<s> Yes?
<s> Get that thing off me, Fergus --
<s> Do you want a cup of tea?
<s> Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
<s> Should blow you away, you know that?
<s> A hotel?
<s> Can't.
<s> So, what do I look like?
<s> I can smell her perfume.
<s> Nope. Not handsome at all.
<s> Could you?
<s> So I've noticed.
<s> Not in your nature.
<s> She's not my type.
<s> Tree.
<s> Like what?
<s> My special friend.
<s> Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
<s> No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
<s> You won't run.
<s> No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
<s> Whatever you say, Jude...
<s> You're crazy --
<s> What about it?
<s> You're going to look for him -- now?
<s> Let's look anyway.
<s> Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
<s> Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
<s> And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
<s> What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
<s> I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
<s> But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
<s> Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
<s> Because they're still here.
<s> Barely, yes.
<s> Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
<s> Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
<s> Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
<s> But no one actually saw him die.
<s> I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
<s> Next, please.
<s> We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
<s> When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
<s> But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
<s> What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
<s> I met a man with sharp nails.
<s> Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
<s> I'm no easier to live with than he was.
<s> So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
<s> I think I love you, Alex --
<s> Maybe.
<s> Maybe.
<s> What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
<s> Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
<s> I dare you.
<s> Go on.
<s> I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
<s> And the last one?
<s> Here's ten.
<s> And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
<s> Not unless we're blind.
<s> He didn't have one.
<s> I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
<s> I know. I would bury it in the garden.
<s> No, Jean-Louis.
<s> Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
<s> Now you're angry.
<s> I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
<s> Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
<s> Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
<s> Having a nervous breakdown.
<s> I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
<s> Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
<s> What was what?
<s> There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
<s> Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
<s> That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
<s> I believe what he said.
<s> But what?
<s> Because I don't love him.
<s> Didn't Charles have any friends?
<s> Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
<s> He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
<s> The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
<s> We will separate -- you look over there.
<s> Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
<s> I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
<s> You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
<s> I get the imports.
<s> Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
<s> You are upset.
<s> No I wasn't.
<s> Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
<s> The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
<s> I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
<s> A bullet to the right cerebellum.
<s> I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
<s> No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
<s> Daddy....
<s> Jesus. Any word from Brent?
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
<s> Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
<s> I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
<s> Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
<s> Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
<s> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
<s> What?
<s> People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
<s> Who was the fourth?
<s> I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
<s> You're the one who's hand is shaking.
<s> Ok.
<s> I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
<s> Art.
<s> Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
<s> Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
<s> Except for the fact that I need cash.
<s> Why don't I--?
<s> ...and a shitload of ice.
<s> ...-tana.
<s> You want cash?
<s> I got, like, uh....
<s> I need your truck!
<s> What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
<s>  Excuse me...
<s> Oh, man.
<s> No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
<s> I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
<s> ...you.
<s> ...man!
<s> Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
<s> Come on!
<s> God, man!
<s> I know the likeli-...
<s> ...Night Shift, but you might...
<s> Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
<s> So you took his...
<s> You know.
<s> Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
<s> I think you oughta cut a...
<s> ...or my conscience.
<s> Huh?
<s> 
<s> It's working.
<s> Hold this. 
<s> 
<s> Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
<s> ...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
<s> That's bullshit.
<s> That was quick.
<s> ...about him.
<s> I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
<s> Well, well, well.
<s> I did what I could for you...
<s> I had no idea how powerful it was.
<s>  ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
<s> ...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
<s> ...owe you.
<s> This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
<s> Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
<s> ...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
<s> But you have no choice but to follow orders.
<s> Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
<s> No!
<s> I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
<s> Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
<s> Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
<s> ...happen if I drop this?
<s> Pleasant surprise.
<s> ...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
<s> INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

<s> Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.

<s> I don't know what the hell...
<s> Where's Arlo?
<s> Where's Elvis?!
<s> Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
<s> His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
<s> You got thirty minutes.
<s> He was Major Andrew Bryn-...

<s> Excellent.
<s> Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
<s> Some people might.

<s> Yeah, yeah...
<s> ...-son.
<s> We've got the real thing!

<s> INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
<s> Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Would you call him a capable man?
<s> Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
<s> No. She's probably scared to death.
<s> Maybe.
<s> We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
<s> What is it?
<s> The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
<s> Just bring your checkbook.
<s> Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
<s> Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
<s> The apple core club.
<s> No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
<s> Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
<s> Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
<s> I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
<s> Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
<s> I said I'll drop it.
<s> You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
<s> It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
<s> I'll stop by.
<s> ...Just a minute...
<s> Oh... thank you.
<s> I have?
<s> Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
<s> But he wasn't killed.
<s> Why?
<s> No. I'm just a snoop.
<s> Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
<s> Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
<s> What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
<s> Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
<s> You saw my fa... father? When?
<s> You bastard.
<s> You won't go to the police if I tell you?
<s> Back to Mexico.
<s> He's in the dark room.
<s> Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
<s> Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
<s> When did you come in?
<s> Ida Sessions.
<s> Perhaps if we could meet your father.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
<s> J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
<s> Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
<s> That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
<s> Yeah.
<s> May I ask what this is regarding?
<s> Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
<s> I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
<s> Yes.
<s> They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
<s> They're all a bunch of phonies.
<s> I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
<s> Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
<s> We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
<s> I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
<s> No...
<s> It tastes wonderful!
<s> Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
<s> Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
<s> They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
<s> Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
<s> Elena. My name's Elena.
<s> Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
<s> What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
<s> I didn't see that.
<s> Two cents.
<s> You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
<s> I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
<s> He made an awful lot of money.
<s> Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
<s> Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
<s> How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> There is no news big enough.
<s> As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
<s> It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
<s> Yes, Mr. kane.
<s> That's Leland, isn't it?
<s> Has he said when he'll finish?
<s> He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
<s> I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
<s> On the chiffonier.  Here.
<s> And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
<s> Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
<s> I work at Seligman's.
<s> We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
<s> Susan, it seems to me -
<s> You can't stop me.
<s> Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
<s> In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
<s> It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
<s> You can't.
<s> Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
<s> Can't say, sir.
<s> It's been a tough day.
<s> How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
<s> It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
<s> Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
<s> Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
<s> You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
<s> You won't be lonely, Charles...
<s> We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
<s> Millions - if anybody wants it.
<s> What about that apartment?
<s> The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
<s> I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
<s> Rosebud?
<s> Am I sure?
<s> What is this, a poll?
<s> This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
<s> You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
<s> You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
<s> What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
<s> The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
<s> Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
<s> He went home to change for the big date.
<s> Awww. That was so cute.
<s> I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
<s> Just now.
<s> Very dramatic, I thought.
<s> Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
<s> How like her.
<s> Sang? His name is a past tense?
<s> You lie.
<s> Jesus, you're caustic.
<s> So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
<s> I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
<s> Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
<s> You have a better suggestion?
<s> He's your fianc.
<s> I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
<s> No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
<s> In a second!
<s> I can pass!
<s> Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
<s> Peptic ulcer.
<s> If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
<s> We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.
<s> Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
<s> Why?
<s> I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
<s> Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
<s> Your mother.
<s> Chess team Allan Harris?!
<s> Blasphemy.
<s> Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
<s> And the second time around...?
<s> I told him that and he yelled at me.
<s> How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
<s> You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
<s> All of them.
<s> Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
<s> I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
<s> We're not playing in the street.
<s> Exactly. They drank it all.
<s> But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
<s> Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
<s> Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
<s> Yeah, but at what a price.
<s> What, your dick?
<s> Listen to you.
<s> I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
<s> I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
<s> I'm happy.
<s> I should shit or get off the pot.
<s> Leave her out of this.
<s> What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
<s> You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
<s> All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
<s> I know I can bench more than that!
<s> You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
<s> Jesus Christ, what next?
<s> No, she's getting married.
<s> I'm not dealing.
<s> Done poisoning the youth for the day?
<s> Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
<s> We were going to start again, I think.
<s> Meaning?
<s> I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
<s> Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
<s> Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
<s> She called you, didn't she?
<s> How do you figure?
<s> Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
<s> John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
<s> I want you to come with me on Monday.
<s> Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
<s> Lower your voice!
<s> Thirty-seven. I just can't...
<s> I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
<s> I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
<s> I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
<s> Scumbag. What are you doing?
<s> Yeah!
<s> I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
<s> Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
<s> You're not?
<s> You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
<s> I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
<s> If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
<s> You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
<s> Look, I know--
<s> If you want, do it.  I don't care.
<s> Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
<s> Not on that leg.
<s> Sure you can.
<s> That's it, you look like a professional.
<s> Nice and easy...
<s> Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
<s> A lot of things fell apart up there.
<s> I don't think you do.
<s> --mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
<s> Flare up of old emotions...
<s> I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
<s> I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
<s> For the same reason you did, to help.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Sure, just give it back when you're done.
<s> If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
<s> What?
<s> This rope is sixty years old!
<s> Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
<s> I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
<s> Half a day.
<s> Who's going with you?
<s> Where's the rest of the team?
<s> Climb, Gabe, climb!
<s> Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
<s> Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
<s> There, what's that place?
<s> You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
<s> I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
<s> Richard Travers.
<s> There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
<s> Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
<s> No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
<s> I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
<s> Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
<s> I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
<s> What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
<s> You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
<s> That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
<s> Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
<s> Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
<s> Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
<s> The accidental killing of a person, sir.
<s> Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
<s> Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
<s> And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
<s> Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
<s> C of E, sir.
<s> Fair hair, sir.
<s> Right. The mothballs, Mister.
<s> What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
<s> Vitamins will it be then?
<s> What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
<s> Yes!!!
<s> Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
<s> Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
<s> Good. I'm glad
<s> Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
<s> I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
<s> They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
<s> Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
<s> I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
<s> Prison custody?
<s> Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
<s> Sir.
<s> And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
<s> Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
<s> We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
<s> Bottega.
<s> Most of the time.
<s> When was the last time you took one?
<s> Max...
<s> He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<s> I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
<s> Oh, my, yes.
<s> Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
<s> I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
<s> I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
<s> Can you finish on schedule?
<s> Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
<s> Elvis?
<s> Pick me up in five minutes.
<s> Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
<s> No harm done, ma'am.
<s> And you came all the way down here to see me?
<s> Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
<s> What's he sayin'?
<s> ...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>...
<s> Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
<s> Twenty-four minutes.
<s> Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
<s> You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
<s> I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
<s> No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
<s> Okay, try it now.
<s> It's a mess.
<s> Tonight it is.
<s> Play music.
<s> You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
<s> It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> Oh, I'm captivated.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Doesn't cover everything.
<s> I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
<s> Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
<s> Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
<s> Who?
<s> I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
<s> You had to kill Heller?!
<s> That's what you said...
<s> Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
<s> Slow down.
<s> Vincent?
<s> Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Geronimo?
<s> Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
<s> Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
<s> You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
<s> For what?
<s> Don't tell me you're naked back there.
<s> Six months.  Eleven days.
<s> This would be it?
<s> Pretty scary, huh?
<s> Is he dead?
<s> How'd he die?
<s> What van?
<s> So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
<s> Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
<s> His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
<s> Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
<s> This way.
<s> Did you kill my father?
<s> To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
<s> Now she tells me.
<s> Then I can't be hurt anymore.
<s> I'm not sure what you mean.
<s> You've asked me that one three times.
<s> We're very specialized.
<s> It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
<s> Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
<s> As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
<s> What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
<s> Not today...
<s> I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
<s> I don't know.  Didn't see him.
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
<s> How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
<s> Tell me.
<s> I'm willing to take that risk.
<s> What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
<s> Meaning...
<s> Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
<s> What?  Why?
<s> I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
<s> Are you threatening me?
<s> You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
<s> ... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
<s> Well --
<s> We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
<s> No primer.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
<s> It's a civilian facility.
<s> Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
<s> Because I can't.
<s> I can't move any smaller.
<s> Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
<s> Can you help us?
<s> I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
<s> The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
<s> A page-break signal.  A period.
<s> Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
<s> Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
<s> Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
<s> What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
<s> -- I'm moving to Washington.
<s> Peter.
<s> Like it or not.
<s> Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
<s> Make that two.
<s> I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
<s> Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
<s> Some of my best friends are scientists.
<s> If you came back.
<s> What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
<s> Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
<s> And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
<s> Recommendations?
<s> Have your department make a full report.
<s> Git your shovel and git to work.
<s> Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
<s> Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
<s> Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
<s> He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
<s> Get away!
<s> A Lucas Jackson.
<s> The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
<s> Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
<s> We got it locked in the sock.
<s> Like an elephant.
<s> We ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> Thass right. Just play it...
<s> Forty-five.
<s> That fool. That damn fool.
<s> Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
<s> Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
<s> All the bears gonna be walking today.
<s> He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What did I do?
<s> Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
<s> When was the last time you washed your hair?
<s> Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
<s> I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
<s> You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
<s> But </u>alive</u>!
<s> Hal has it.
<s> Tell her about <u>what</u>?
<s> 'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
<s> You get me out first.
<s> You already made the delivery?
<s> I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
<s> That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
<s> Who was the man in the basement?
<s> You know where.
<s> That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
<s> I think this is number three...
<s> For months... last October.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
<s> Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
<s> You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
<s> They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
<s> They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
<s> No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
<s> Go and look for a note.
<s> We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
<s> Honest to God, Ruben!
<s> Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
<s> Look at him, grandstanding...
<s> Yessir.
<s> The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
<s> What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
<s> I'd like to go back. James...
<s> Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
<s> I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
<s> Are you still involving me in your crash?
<s> A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
<s> Hard to say.
<s> No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
<s> It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
<s> It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
<s> A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
<s> You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
<s> I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
<s> All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
<s> Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
<s> Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
<s> Please, Letty.
<s> Really?
<s> But everything's OK?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> That's thanks to all your help.
<s> I ruined your wedding night.
<s> Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
<s> Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
<s> I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
<s> I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
<s> You too, Mom.
<s> It's good exercise, Mom.
<s> It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
<s> To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
<s> Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
<s> Paul.
<s> So are you engaged, or what?
<s> The left one.
<s> The lady knows this is a dandelion.
<s> What are the delusions like?
<s> I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
<s> Your family just met me.
<s> I better make a list.
<s> Aren't you ever quiet?
<s> You like it?
<s> I like it.     But Headlines are better.
<s> I'll see you tonight.
<s> It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
<s> The restaurant, too?
<s> I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
<s> I got worried. Are you OK?
<s> When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
<s> Always the drugs.
<s> I saw you talking to my Mom.
<s> I think I should call someone.
<s> I guess so.
<s> In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
<s> I'm calling in sick.
<s> Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
<s> Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
<s> You just need to get more organized. L
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm going to the store.
<s> Oh.
<s> I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
<s> Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
<s> So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
<s> If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
<s> Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
<s> Not today.   Where are your friends?
<s> Oui.
<s> Uh, yeah.
<s> Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
<s> You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
<s> Yes.
<s> Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
<s> Why do I always have to answer the phone?
<s> No one? Then why is Zero here?
<s> I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
<s> Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
<s> Good idea.
<s> You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
<s> If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
<s> I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
<s> I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
<s> How much?
<s> You said don't do it, boss.
<s> You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
<s> The Holiday Hotel.
<s> I was told to take what we have and go.
<s> Oh, then we will have the house wine.
<s> She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
<s> Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
<s> 
<s> God, I want to go home.
<s> He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
<s> Fuck me?   Fuck you!
<s> Watch this.
<s> What?
<s> He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
<s> I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
<s> -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
<s> How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
<s> Something like that.
<s> No.
<s> I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
<s> It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
<s> I do as I please.
<s> Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
<s> I'll never live as a thief!
<s> The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
<s> Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
<s> How so?
<s> Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
<s> Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
<s> She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
<s> It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
<s> I left the training early.
<s> It's time for me to leave it behind.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
<s> Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
<s> It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
<s> To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
<s> What about you?
<s> When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
<s> This is a delicate matter.
<s> Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
<s> Don't thank me.
<s> You don't say.
<s> I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
<s> Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
<s> How 'bout the morgue?
<s> Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
<s> Your pain ends now.
<s> Very well, it's your ass.
<s> 18k.  Crap.
<s> Is he inside?
<s> "Our" Crow...?
<s> Junior.
<s> That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
<s> A friend wrote me.
<s> Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
<s> Please.
<s> Why not?
<s> Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
<s> Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
<s> Without question.
<s> It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
<s> How was your date?
<s> Of Human Bondage.
<s> Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
<s> Hi.
<s> I'm sorry about that.
<s> Doesn't ring a bell.
<s> It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
<s> I'll see you tomorrow.
<s> It was nothing.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
<s> Something awful happened last night.
<s> It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
<s> No.
<s> I don't love him. I love Ronald.
<s> It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
<s> My mom? Don't call my mom.
<s> Is it me?
<s> I'm taking a shower.
<s> I do.
<s> Same time next week?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Racist piece of shit.
<s> He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
<s> I see your point... though why should I care?
<s> Could you be more desperate to read it?
<s> Blow me.
<s> Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
<s> Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
<s> I hate it too.
<s> And that's why you're losing your bet?
<s> With who?
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Well done.
<s> Thank you. Now, where were we?
<s> Come again?
<s> Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
<s> It's Cecile.
<s> I'll do that.
<s> Do you know where she is?
<s> Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
<s> I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
<s> The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
<s> Irena.
<s> All right, mommy.
<s> I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
<s> I forgot I had it on.
<s> I think I should.  3000W?
<s> I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
<s> I live right here.
<s> Yes, daddy.
<s> Voices from an old dark house!
<s> This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
<s> Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
<s> For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
<s> That one's an elm.
<s> It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
<s> But she's such a nice lady.
<s> Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
<s> Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
<s> I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
<s> Go on -- out with you.
<s> And Amy mailed them?
<s> She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
<s> Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
<s> That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
<s> What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
<s> Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
<s> Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
<s> Good. Except for PMS.
<s> It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
<s> Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
<s> Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
<s> And my bra finally fits again.
<s> You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
<s> It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
<s> Okay. I guess so.
<s> Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
<s> I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
<s> No you don't, believe me.
<s> I put it down the garbage disposal.
<s> What? Why'd you do that?
<s> No.
<s> Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
<s> I'm not really hungry after all.
<s> I really gotta pee.
<s> So pee? Here?
<s> You never say that.
<s> I can't help it, it smells so good.
<s> Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
<s> I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
<s> My bra is my biggest supporter.
<s> No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
<s> NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
<s> Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
<s> Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
<s> Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
<s> No, I got it. It's okay.
<s> I love you too.
<s> Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Oh my god, what happened?
<s> No, take it.
<s> How big?
<s> Tell her I'm eating.
<s> Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
<s> Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
<s> The park dude was missing an arm.
<s> Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
<s> Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
<s> Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
<s> He's seriously disturbed...
<s> How could you have been so stupid?
<s> Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
<s> I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
<s> Why are they after you?
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
<s> Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
<s> Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
<s> `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
<s> What the hell is this ?
<s> Great.
<s> Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
<s> You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fine...
<s> Fine.
<s> I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
<s> Bob...
<s> Like how?
<s> Yes.
<s> It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
<s> Clean.
<s> Oh.  Excuse me.
<s> I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
<s> I don't think so.
<s> He's only doing what you told him to.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> So what do we do?
<s> Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
<s> I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
<s> Oh, yeah... probably...
<s> ... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
<s> You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> We'd like to hire you.
<s> Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
<s> The Vice-President...
<s> Thanks, Duane.
<s> I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
<s> They asked me to help.
<s> I'm not Bill Mitchell.
<s> It was inspirational.
<s> I can't.
<s> I know.
<s> ... Me, too.
<s> Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
<s> Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
<s> The tunnel.
<s> SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
<s> That sounds like a curse to me.
<s> Maybe.
<s> We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
<s> You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
<s> They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
<s> Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
<s> That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
<s> Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
<s> Will do.
<s> Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
<s> Women swoon!
<s> Hey, this is great.
<s> Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
<s> So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
<s> I told you, that's a secret.
<s> But...
<s> Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
<s> It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
<s> Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
<s> Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
<s> It's Nuwanda.
<s> They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
<s> I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
<s> What good will that do?
<s> It's better than doing nothing.
<s> It does?  What?
<s> You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
<s> Just like that?!  You just knew?
<s> Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
<s> Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
<s> I didn't know you taught.
<s> Courtyard?
<s> A madman.
<s> His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
<s> I have something.
<s> Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
<s> Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
<s> It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
<s> Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
<s> Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
<s> Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
<s> That's miles.
<s> I... I just don't want to come.
<s> That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
<s> I guess.
<s> You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
<s> From my father and Nolan.
<s> I will be with thee straight.
<s> YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
<s> I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...

<s> Just trying to get to my boat...

<s> A meat locker.
<s> What?

<s> You ain't giving the orders here!

<s> Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
<s> But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
<s> No, Stone!
<s> I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?

<s> Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
<s> Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
<s> Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
<s> Do you think I'm grudging it?
<s> Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
<s> Jabez!
<s> Jabez --
<s> I don't know, Jabez.
<s> I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!

<s> All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
<s> Do you still want the operation?
<s> I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.

<s> Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
<s> I didn't feel well...
<s> Mmph?  Where am I?
<s> That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
<s> This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
<s> Eddie, you screwed up.
<s> You'll be fighting with the octopus.
<s> Huh?
<s> Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
<s> It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
<s> Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
<s> Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
<s> Yeah, she's really somethin'.
<s> I guessed.
<s> Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
<s> Isn't he?
<s> I thought he was dead.
<s> Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
<s> So did you get his autograph?
<s> This is my way of telling you --
<s> Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
<s> That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
<s> I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!
<s> I understand you just moved here?
<s> That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
<s> I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
<s> Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
<s> It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
<s> Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
<s> It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
<s> Da pleasure be mine.
<s> But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
<s> Okey-dokey.
<s> Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
<s> We're escaping!
<s> Yes?
<s> Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
<s> Um, I guess --
<s> Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
<s> I did.  I established some tits and ass.
<s> This is my thirteenth pair.
<s> I just picked them up on the way over...
<s> Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Uh, atomic energy?
<s> Lines around the block.
<s> We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
<s> What octopus motor?
<s> Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
<s> You know, you're a very attractive girl.
<s> You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
<s> No! Do they show you having sex?
<s> Yeah, so... ?
<s> What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
<s> She doesn't give a shit about him.
<s> What if Shari's the dream?
<s> Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
<s> Tell me.
<s> I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
<s> So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
<s> When? Today?
<s> Right.
<s> Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
<s> Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
<s> He made a mistake.
<s> I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
<s> But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
<s> Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
<s> Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
<s> She left.
<s> I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
<s> Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
<s> They're gonna mock our foibles.
<s> It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
<s> Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
<s> I hear the dog really liked him.
<s> Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, when you put it that way.
<s> Really?
<s> Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
<s> I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
<s> Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
<s> Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
<s> Where were you?
<s> Thumbsucker!
<s> We're excited.
<s> In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
<s> What?
<s> Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
<s> Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> You brought the cameras here!
<s> What...
<s> Ed... I'm sorry.
<s> Do you still have it?
<s> Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
<s> Good?
<s> What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
<s> Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
<s> That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
<s> He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
<s> Anything wrong?
<s> Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
<s> Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
<s> Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> I know.
<s> Ethics are...
<s> Hey, that's super
<s> You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
<s> Good luck, Tracy.
<s> Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
<s> Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
<s> And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
<s> That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
<s> Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
<s> Yes?
<s> Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
<s> You will.
<s> Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
<s> Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
<s> I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
<s> This weekend.
<s> I don't know. All I know is I did it I
<s> I have proof.
<s> Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
<s> Okay.  Give me the drill.
<s> Should we get a what?
<s> No, I... uh, didn't know that
<s> You're there.
<s> I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
<s> Okay, let's say
<s> No way I It doesn't make sense.
<s> Larry, you just take it easy
<s> Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
<s> It's not what you think.
<s> Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
<s> Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
<s> You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
<s> If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
<s> I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
<s> Call me Dudley.
<s> How?
<s> No!  Please leave!
<s> It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
<s> It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
<s> Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
<s> He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
<s> At least not anymore.
<s> <u>Lynn</u>.
<s> I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
<s> You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
<s> I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
<s> It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
<s> The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
<s> Until he gunned down six people.
<s> Dogs got no reason to live.
<s> Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
<s> There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
<s> Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
<s> A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
<s> What's this all about, lad?
<s> No.
<s> <u>Throwing me</u>?
<s> What about you?
<s> Give me a minute, will ya?
<s> It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
<s> Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
<s> I want to do it right.
<s> Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
<s> Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
<s> What's her name?
<s> Why?
<s> Right now, before I back down.
<s> Officer White?
<s> Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
<s> Showbiz.
<s> Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
<s> You're not.
<s> Listen to me--
<s> Clear as day.
<s> Be careful, Danny.
<s> Rachel Banks?
<s> Told by whom?
<s> What do they have to do with this?
<s> The NSA?
<s> Wait.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
<s> Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
<s> One-twenty.
<s> I called from a payphone!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> What about newspapers and magazines?
<s> What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
<s> Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
<s> No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
<s> With what?
<s> Hello. Hello, Maria.
<s> I'll say.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
<s> That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
<s> What kind of trouble.
<s> Something bad happened tonight.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, you know--
<s> "Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
<s> I see her for business.
<s> This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
<s> A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
<s> Here, you can use this.
<s> Sir?
<s> Don't count on it.
<s> You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
<s> That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
<s> Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
<s> Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
<s> For the last four years.
<s> You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> We're screwed.
<s> How?
<s> What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
<s> I'm sorry about that.
<s> We believe he did.
<s> And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
<s> I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
<s> Oh, well, that's true.
<s> Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
<s> L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
<s> Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
<s> Alright!
<s> Usually they take clothes.
<s> Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
<s> You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
<s> I have a family.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Bobby--
<s> The police?
<s> You remember Daniel Zavitz?
<s> I don't know.
<s> You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
<s> He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
<s> Hiding something?
<s> So they know everything.
<s> Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
<s> The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
<s> No.
<s> What do you mean, poetry?
<s> He said - be careful.
<s> I thought you might paste them into your book.
<s> I'd like you to have them.
<s> Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
<s> That makes it harder still.
<s> A lie.  What do you hate most?
<s> I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
<s> You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
<s> A surprise, he said.
<s> What?
<s> I haven't, no.  Sorry.
<s> Sorry, what's your point?
<s> Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
<s> Her hands and feet were tied.
<s> Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
<s> Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
<s> No.
<s> Don't cut me.  Come on.
<s> I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
<s> So was my Patient.
<s> What?  How could he have?  When?
<s> Please don't creep around this house.
<s> What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
<s> Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
<s> Are you planning to be the exception?
<s> Moose.
<s> Is there a song you don't know?
<s> There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
<s> I'm fine.  I got hot.
<s> Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
<s> What?
<s> Apprentices.
<s> Oh no, really.  She has her book.
<s> I can already see.
<s> Why?  Can he lay eggs?
<s> Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
<s> In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
<s> I've been told that before.
<s> The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
<s> Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
<s> Then come with me.
<s> Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
<s> Why not?
<s> I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
<s> No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book.
<s> Why?  Are you German?
<s> I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
<s> Bingo.
<s> Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
<s> Why didn't I think of that?
<s> We're getting close.
<s> Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
<s> Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
<s> Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
<s> No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<s> It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
<s> I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
<s> You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
<s> No. It's a down payment.
<s> Try laps. Say a hundred.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
<s> Terrified. Still am.
<s> Behind you.
<s> Hold the record. Alone.
<s> You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
<s> Right. The eight billion.
<s> Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
<s> And the money goes--
<s> But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
<s> I sincerely hope not.
<s> Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
<s> This is big enough.
<s> Because I never assume anything.
<s> That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
<s> Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
<s> What do you think?  What's this?
<s> An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
<s> I'll say.  Holy moley.
<s> Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
<s> I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
<s> It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
<s> Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
<s> Five million dollars.
<s> Any school you want.
<s> Yup.
<s> You said things would be fine, and they're not.
<s> Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
<s> What, you think I'm made of money?
<s> -- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
<s> Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
<s> Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
<s> We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
<s> Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
<s> D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
<s> I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
<s> It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
<s> It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
<s> I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<s> Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
<s> Right.
<s> Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
<s> That's right.
<s> I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
<s> Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
<s> Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
<s> Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
<s> Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
<s> Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
<s> C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
<s> I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
<s> Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
<s> Better safe than sorry.
<s> It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
<s> What?  But you been working so hard --
<s> Thinking.
<s> Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
<s> Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
<s> That's okay.  I understand.
<s> Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
<s> What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
<s> You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
<s> Yes?
<s> Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
<s> He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
<s> The Emperor?
<s> This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
<s> We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
<s> Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
<s> You must.  Luke, look at me!
<s> Ben ... Ben ...
<s> You won't.
<s> Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<s> Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
<s> There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
<s> Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
<s> No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
<s> What was it?
<s> An Imperial probe droid.
<s> Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
<s> Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
<s> I take it back.
<s> I'm against that.
<s> Would you please stop calling me that?
<s> Yes, you do.
<s> That's quite a compliment.
<s> Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
<s> Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
<s> Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
<s> Here ... near the Anoat system.
<s> You keep logs?  My, how organized.
<s> Who's staring?
<s> I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
<s> Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
<s> Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
<s> Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
<s> What did you say?!
<s> That is why you fail.
<s> But I feel The Force flowing!
<s> The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
<s> No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
<s> No! .... Never ....
<s> But we saw Earth destroyed.
<s> Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
<s> Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
<s> I'm a psychiatrist.
<s> Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
<s> It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
<s> You never heard of Snake Plissken?
<s> You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
<s> He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
<s> Can you land?
<s> And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
<s> Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
<s> Lock fuel rods.
<s> It's history. I gotta go.
<s> Does he know how to activate it?
<s> Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
<s> I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
<s> Yeah, kinda.
<s> I'm looking for somebody.
<s> ...I saw nothing.
<s> Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
<s> --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
<s> I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
<s> Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
<s> Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
<s> What's this, what's this?!
<s> I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
<s> ...to ride out and meet them.
<s> Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
<s> What is it my child?
<s> I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
<s> --And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
<s> There is one.
<s> You.
<s> Can it truly be used for magic?
<s> People make you laugh?
<s> Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
<s> --I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
<s> Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
<s> --What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
<s> Fuck it.
<s> And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
<s> I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
<s> What's this?
<s> Storage.
<s> Me too.
<s> Want to ask him?
<s> Please.
<s> Of course. Have you got a pen?
<s> No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
<s> No thanks Karl.
<s> You're kidding! Like what?
<s> The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
<s> The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
<s> Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
<s> Please go away.
<s> That depends.
<s> No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
<s> Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
<s> Like what?
<s> Oh............
<s> No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
<s> Here I'll show you.
<s> Well, maybe he's sleeping.
<s> You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
<s> You like him.
<s> Okay.
<s> Honey this is Father Dyer.
<s> So what's next?
<s> I came to say goodbye.
<s> How's the girl?
<s> Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
<s> No.
<s> Ego te abslovo.
<s> Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
<s> Why?
<s> Who places her trust in thee, my God.
<s> And let my cry come unto thee.
<s> Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
<s> Only what I read in the papers.
<s> Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
<s> Is that a threat?
<s> Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
<s> That's to bad.
<s> Who's in it?
<s> Yes?
<s> If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
<s> You're not going to drive!
<s> Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
<s> Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
<s> Baker.
<s> The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
<s> Oh.
<s> How's the birthday girl?
<s> How we doing?
<s> Jack...
<s> Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
<s> They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
<s> You got weird kids, Frank.
<s> Bosen black.  Flat.
<s> Try the black Knable.
<s> So do I.
<s> No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
<s> You'll see.
<s> Yeah, okay.
<s> Your doorbell doesn't work.
<s> You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
<s> I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
<s> Talk.
<s> What?
<s> It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
<s> I was just thinking what Ma would think.
<s> She'll get here.
<s> Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
<s> Last?
<s> I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
<s> No. Why?
<s> She's a big girl.
<s> What the hell are these?
<s> You always threw up.
<s> Just until we find another girl.
<s> That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
<s> No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
<s> Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
<s> I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
<s> No.
<s> Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
<s> Doctor's orders.
<s> Right.
<s> When we know.
<s> The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
<s> Do I look like I'm naked?
<s> Am I missing something?
<s> Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
<s> Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
<s> So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
<s> What're you talking about?  They love it.
<s> Gotta go.
<s> Job.
<s> I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
<s> So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
<s> Baker.
<s> Regular hours are eight to five.
<s> I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
<s> Every year.
<s> Sure.
<s> No kidding?
<s> So, what happened?
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.  Got my own sign.
<s> We outgrew each other.
<s> You don't pick your brother.
<s> Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
<s> It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
<s> I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
<s> Wow.
<s> Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Merry Christmas.
<s> Sure.
<s> They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
<s> ... Thanks.
<s> Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
<s> You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
<s> A few blanks?  Like what?
<s> Only one you've never broken.
<s> We need to talk.
<s> Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
<s> Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
<s> Jon, what is it?
<s> Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
<s> Just make sure you're there.  On time.
<s> Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
<s> Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
<s> Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
<s> Not if I kill you first ...
<s> Pollux is -- what?
<s> What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
<s> Janie?
<s> Well, I saw you -- Kim.
<s> What?
<s> Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
<s> What do you know about it?
<s> The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
<s> -- I've got to study.
<s> Back then -- who wasn't?
<s> Ooh, my suits are ready...
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
<s> Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
<s> Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
<s> Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
<s> Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
<s> Seven.  Really.
<s> I dont think youre hearing me.

<s> No.
<s> I've got everything I need.
<s> Thats my car!  You stole my car!
<s> How much time?!
<s> Why not?
<s> Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
<s> You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
<s> You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
<s> I dont think so, thank you...
<s> Need a nurse?
<s> Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
<s> Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
<s> What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
<s> Yeah...fine.
<s> Because youll be here.
<s> And...?
<s> Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
<s> Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
<s> Its good, right?
<s> What...?
<s> Zeena...
<s> Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
<s> Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Worse, you mean...
<s> Thats all I wanted to hear...
<s> Are you okay, Jack?
<s> Its good to see you...
<s> What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
<s> A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
<s> I'd like that, too.

<s> Ben.  Are you okay?
<s> This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
<s> Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
<s> Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.

<s> Stay right.  Left is trouble.
<s> Okay, "mom."

<s> What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
<s> Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
<s> You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
<s> What?  What do you mean you --
<s> We need to get past them.
<s> Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
<s> The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
<s> And reverse the mutations --
<s> Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
<s> You <u>were</u>?
<s> I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
<s> Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --

<s> They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
<s> And take a little trip with them...
<s> Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
<s> Yes?
<s> That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
<s> Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
<s> I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.

<s> Now I know...
<s> Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
<s> But I did. I'm positive!
<s> Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.

<s> We split that.
<s> Yeah, you already said that.
<s> Personal matters.
<s> Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
<s> My wife! What the - how's -

<s> Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
<s> And what about the other fella?
<s> Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
<s> Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
<s> Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
<s> That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
<s> Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
<s> Okay.
<s> It's okay, Scotty.
<s> Whatcha watchin' there?
<s> Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
<s> Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
<s> ...There's a million dollars here!
<s> Mm.
<s> Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
<s> I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
<s> I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
<s> Yah.
<s> That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
<s> Aw, Norm.
<s> Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.

<s> You can't have the whole brain!
<s> Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
<s> What... ?
<s> Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
<s> Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
<s> Do you care?
<s> That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> ... You know me?
<s> What?

<s> I felt like destroying something beautiful.
<s> Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
<s> Answer me, Tyler.
<s> You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
<s> But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
<s> What about them?  They're lunatics.
<s> If you know, I know.
<s> Green?  Did you say green?
<s> Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
<s> I think this is about where we came in.
<s> Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
<s> Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
<s> Why are you doing this?!
<s> Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
<s> Well, sir, you said you might.

<s> Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
<s> Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
<s> No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.

<s> No, I'm good.

<s> I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
<s> I thought he was with you.
<s> Where's his father?
<s> In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
<s> Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
<s> Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
<s> I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
<s> Not yet.
<s> I know.
<s> Have fun.
<s> This mission was a scam from the word go?
<s> Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
<s> American.  Come to get you out.
<s> Do I look like I have someone special?
<s> I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
<s> I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
<s> You still believe in God?
<s> Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
<s> I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
<s> No, it's not... Come here...
<s> You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
<s> No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
<s> <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
<s> Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
<s> I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
<s> You can ask.
<s> Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
<s> Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
<s> Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
<s> But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
<s> Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
<s> Fifty dollars?
<s> Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
<s> No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
<s> That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
<s> So what? You going to help me?
<s> WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
<s> Who?
<s> Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
<s> Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
<s> <u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
<s> BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
<s> You advise us!
<s> I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
<s> Got any Ethel Merman?
<s> Listen, I'm not feeling well.
<s> You're married.
<s> Twinky?
<s> Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
<s> No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
<s> You're the pathetic one, not me.
<s> If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
<s> You'll be gone, period.
<s> I don't, huh?
<s> You're lucky no one was hurt.
<s> Who?
<s> No. How much do I owe you?
<s> Am I on TV?
<s> Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
<s> Don't tell me about this...
<s> Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
<s> My turn.
<s> Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
<s> Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
<s> I gave it a second thought.
<s> No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
<s> Catherine...
<s> Yes.
<s> No, the last time was three years ago.
<s> Thanks, Carl...
<s> What?
<s> Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
<s> There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
<s> Is it true?
<s> I'm wit' Carlos.

<s> Um. Yeah! Shorty!

<s> Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
<s> For real?
<s> Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
<s> Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
<s> She didn't say she had no man.
<s> Positive.
<s> So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
<s> Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
<s> Nineteen.
<s> I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
<s> You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
<s> I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
<s> Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
<s> Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
<s> Funny old bird.
<s> Oh, he was dying for years.
<s> Just relax....
<s> Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
<s> I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
<s> Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
<s> Yes, right away.
<s> Thank you.
<s> This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
<s> Wait a second --
<s> Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
<s> Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
<s> And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
<s> You sure did.
<s> No problem.
<s> I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
<s> Who?
<s> In this drawer....
<s> Precisely. Are you a good shot?
<s> You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
<s> You sure those doors will be open?
<s> Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
<s> You doing a story on this guy?
<s> Nothing to it.
<s> I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.

<s> It's Scotch-Rumanian.

<s> Preoccupied with what?

<s> Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
<s> Hi.
<s> Depends on the question.
<s> Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
<s> I'll take you to a game.
<s> I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
<s> Come here.
<s> You shouldn't be here.
<s> Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
<s> No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
<s> What?
<s> This morning.
<s> Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
<s> I don't know.  Look!
<s> You broke it? You know the source?
<s> He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
<s> Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
<s> I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
<s> All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
<s> What about finding the source?
<s> Get out of here.
<s> You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
<s> But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
<s> My secretary.
<s> In a minute!
<s> I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
<s> But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
<s> Oh... I have some questions.
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> What did these Vancouver factories do?
<s> Thanks, I needed that.
<s> Right away!
<s> Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
<s> Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
<s> You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
<s> Go on, 'they're stahting.'
<s> Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
<s> I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
<s> You're not funny.
<s> Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
<s> Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
<s> Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
<s> What?
<s> I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
<s> Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
<s> Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
<s> Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
<s> No, wait...
<s> I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
<s> Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
<s> ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
<s> You need it.
<s> Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
<s> Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
<s> Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
<s> Who's my real father, man?
<s> Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
<s> You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
<s> An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
<s> Go on, another time, another place.
<s> You're a poet and didn't know it.
<s> That's funny, you're cute.
<s> I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
<s> Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
<s> No - no.
<s> No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
<s> Takin' care o' business, honey.
<s> Yes --
<s> Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
<s> Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
<s> Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
<s> What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
<s> Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
<s> You want some eggs.
<s> Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
<s> Who's on him?
<s> Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
<s> A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
<s> There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
<s> Third time around.
<s> What is that old building?
<s> For garbage?
<s> I been damn careful up to now.
<s> You know what I'm saying.
<s> Baltimore?
<s> Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
<s> Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
<s> Well, why not a little of the King?
<s> Sure.
<s> Wish you weren't.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
<s> Do you know where I found this?
<s> Uh, huh.
<s> Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
<s> I can't believe people are still using these things.
<s> I got fed up with all the bullshit.
<s> Uh huh...
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
<s> Too busy playin' ball, huh?
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Something happened, something...
<s> No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
<s> There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
<s> That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
<s> No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
<s> Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
<s> We're okay...we're good, Dad.
<s> Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
<s> What?
<s> Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
<s> Huh?
<s> That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
<s> Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
<s> No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
<s> You work too hard, John.
<s> A hot shot, huh?
<s> I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
<s> According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
<s> No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
<s> Where's Shelly?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
<s> Barely.
<s> Chuck... look.
<s> Will you come with me?
<s> Did you stay here last night?
<s> Are you all right, Shelly?
<s> No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
<s> It's deceiving.
<s> The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
<s> ... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
<s> It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
<s> May be please have the wallet.
<s> Keep looking.
<s> Damn you, Shelly!
<s> Go out and plug the cord back in.
<s> No way...  ...I wanna rock!
<s> Why?
<s> Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
<s> He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
<s> Happy Friday the 13th.
<s> Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
<s> I could swear I heard...
<s> Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
<s> When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
<s> All he's asking is for you to check it out.
<s> Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
<s> No.
<s> I hope so.
<s> Who ya calling?
<s> Yeah, we're here.
<s> No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
<s> I've seen it.
<s> If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
<s> Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
<s> Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
<s> N...nothing.
<s> She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
<s> Okay.
<s> About what?
<s> No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
<s> Hear what?
<s> She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
<s> They're out of town.
<s> But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
<s> Walking corpses are not real!
<s> Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
<s> I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
<s> He is not.
<s> About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
<s> The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
<s> I want to go home. I want off this ship.
<s> The window...
<s> That's where I peed.
<s> I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
<s> Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
<s> Do not inhale.
<s> You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
<s> I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
<s> Do we care?
<s> I don't have the problems that artists have.
<s> Then you should carry a gun.
<s> Where is it?
<s> It's your best play, Nicky.
<s> Keep going west. Last building before the river.
<s> I hear Alan's sick.
<s> You know about Adele.
<s> You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
<s> I have a class. I'm late.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Everything.
<s> Daddy, wait.
<s> What's sexy?
<s> And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
<s> Who the hell cares?
<s> I'd forgotten that.
<s> I'm glad we're having this talk.
<s> This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
<s> I don't know if I can say that.
<s> You're hurting my head.
<s> This could be it!
<s> I'm at the door.
<s> It's me. Nicky.
<s> But the son is suppose to stop crying.
<s> He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
<s> It's a simple subject.
<s> I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
<s> Because faith is rewarded.
<s> But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
<s> I kissed her while she was laughing.
<s> Engaging.
<s> I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
<s> Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
<s> Where are you going now?
<s> He goes to the theater armed.
<s> I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
<s> All the more reason.
<s> "I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
<s> No. That is what you get for distracting me.
<s> I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> He said he's in charge...
<s> Panditji -- please, help me.
<s> I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
<s> I hope not.
<s> No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
<s> That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
<s> Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
<s> My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
<s> I dined at the prison.
<s> Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
<s> Er, no...
<s> Grudges?
<s> --What <i>about</i> his profile?
<s> It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
<s> It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
<s> You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
<s> No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
<s> Six one.
<s> The Mission Director.
<s> You know I'm scared of heights.
<s> I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
<s> How long?
<s> I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
<s> I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
<s> Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
<s> I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
<s> Antonio, the choir...
<s> I hope he's not just a body.
<s> Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<s> Why not?
<s> No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
<s> Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
<s> Only every time I'm in here.
<s> --Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
<s> Stay clean.
<s> They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
<s> You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I want to take a walk.
<s> Better than old times.
<s> I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
<s> Fatter... some things never change.
<s> No. It's been a long time.
<s> Better than I remembered.
<s> But sometimes I cried a lot too.
<s> Usually on the right side as you go in.
<s> For exits off Main Street.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
<s> What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
<s> I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
<s> Let's do it.
<s> El Paso.
<s> No scars.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
<s> I don't see how.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Where do we go from here?
<s> They will have our description before we can get a plane.
<s> Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Tell her you robbed a bank...
<s> I'm good at that.
<s> Whatever you need.
<s> Aren't we going a little hard?
<s> Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
<s> You serious?
<s> Nothing. What could I do?
<s> Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
<s> What?
<s> Christ, what...
<s> Jack, you're wrong.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Really?
<s> So where are we going, Princess?
<s> You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
<s> Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
<s> Not entirely. No.
<s> Sure I'm sure.
<s> What girl?
<s> Shouldn't think so.
<s> Expect so.
<s> Wilton Estate.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why would it?
<s> Nobody seems to know.
<s> Who's Brumby?
<s> No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
<s> Get knotted.
<s> Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
<s> That little shit!
<s> What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> That's all right, Eric.
<s> You should have told me who you were working for.
<s> Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
<s> Still got your sense of humour.
<s> You're bluffing, you bastard!
<s> No.
<s> To get on the...
<s> I'd never try to sell an Indian.
<s> ...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
<s> With River Oaks?
<s> What hard part?
<s> That's right...
<s> Men come work for you...
<s> What?
<s> We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
<s> You have to steal the leads tonight?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Why would I do it?
<s> Yes.  I'm sure.
<s> ...what am I going to do all month...
<s> Yes.  The cops.  No.
<s> Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
<s> When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
<s> No, who?
<s> You think so?
<s> You understand?
<s> Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
<s> Thank you, George.
<s> ...did they...
<s> Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
<s> They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
<s> I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
<s> ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
<s> Moss.
<s> I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
<s> You know what those leads cost?
<s> Yes.
<s> What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
<s> And fifty bucks a lead.
<s> No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
<s> Good.  Now we're talking.
<s> Now.  Yes...When?
<s> You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
<s> I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
<s> You want something off the B list?
<s> Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
<s> You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
<s> You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
<s> What?
<s> How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
<s> What sales?
<s> Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
<s> Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
<s> Because I don't like you.
<s> "'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
<s> "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
<s> Well, we'll do that this weekend.
<s> Which...
<s> Uh...
<s> Oh!  For the magazine...
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
<s> Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
<s> I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
<s> Did I...?
<s> Mmmm...
<s> I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
<s> I'm not.
<s> But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
<s> Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
<s> And the check is...
<s> You going to turn State's?
<s> Fuck the Machine.
<s> Why not?
<s> You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
<s> Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
<s> I'm going home.
<s> I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
<s> Some of them...
<s> I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
<s> I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
<s> That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
<s>  You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
<s> You're not my father!
<s> I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
<s> I'm not afraid of his words.
<s> He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
<s> I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
<s> We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
<s> Mio fratello.
<s> It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
<s> What's that?
<s> In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
<s> Kay... Kay...
<s> We don't know that's true, he never said that.
<s> She's gone, Tom.
<s> Yeah, give me a minute.
<s> No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
<s> Mike, at three and a half...
<s> She took the Senate Investigation worse.
<s> Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
<s> That plane goes to Miami...
<s> I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
<s> Twenty-five this time.
<s> Mike wants it.
<s> He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
<s> That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
<s> Do you gamble?
<s> Do you owe markers?
<s> We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
<s> Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
<s> He is, I believe, a brother.
<s> This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
<s> I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
<s> Who do you think you're talking to?
<s> Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
<s> You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
<s> The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
<s> Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
<s> It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
<s> You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
<s> So?
<s> Let him gamble.
<s> I do not.
<s> You were unfair with them.
<s> Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
<s> Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
<s> All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
<s> And?
<s> You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
<s> We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
<s> I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
<s> What's to be jealous of?
<s> It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
<s> Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
<s> Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
<s> What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
<s> That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
<s> No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
<s> No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
<s> I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
<s> I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
<s> It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
<s> We have his note.
<s> Mornin'.
<s> Just that I was in the Marines.
<s> Huh?
<s> Broke is more like it.
<s> Football in college.
<s> Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
<s> Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
<s> What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
<s> Not at the moment.
<s> Not fear.  More like disgust.
<s> There's no people like you in my crowd.
<s> You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
<s> You're talking through your hat now.
<s> You asked me to model.  Remember?
<s> I'm game.  Sure.
<s> I don't hear anything.
<s> Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
<s> David produced her last picture.
<s> Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
<s> Good.  Let's get dry.
<s> No.  Definitely not.
<s> What happened?
<s> Your friend?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> You'll feel better tomorrow.
<s> The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
<s> She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You didn't, Jimmy.
<s> Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
<s> Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
<s> In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
<s> Go.
<s> Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
<s> I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
<s> It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
<s> I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
<s> Sure.
<s> Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
<s> Everything.  Start at the beginning.
<s> How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
<s> Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
<s> But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
<s> What rumors might those be?
<s> I guess.
<s> I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
<s> Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
<s> Is there someplace we can talk?
<s> Tell me about Kip -
<s> And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
<s> I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
<s> I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
<s> How is he?
<s> You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
<s> No...
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> Consider me gone, Detective --
<s> Double-meaning intended --
<s> Double-meaning intended, right?
<s> Mother -- !
<s> You guys are through...
<s> Damn crooks is everywhere --
<s> Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
<s> Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
<s> I can handle it --
<s> I can handle it --
<s> I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
<s> The family that steals together, deals together...
<s> The era when crime didn't pay --
<s> What?
<s> I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
<s> I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
<s> No problem -
<s> Run it...
<s> Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
<s> Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
<s> Where we going -- ?
<s> Call 'em here -- ?
<s> The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
<s> Mitch.
<s> No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
<s> Hey -
<s> No ...
<s> "Unlock my button" ... ?
<s> They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
<s> Of course you are. You're a professional...
<s> What about The Club ... ?
<s> Of course. Hi, Junie --
<s> He's gotten involved --
<s> No we don't -
<s> He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
<s> Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
<s> Not really --
<s> Excuse me --
<s> Shit all looks the same here --
<s> The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
<s> No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
<s> Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
<s> What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
<s> What are you gonna do?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
<s> Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
<s> I got seared.
<s> What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
<s> There are cops all over the place.
<s> Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
<s> Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
<s> But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
<s> All right, then.
<s> Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
<s> Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
<s> She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> Why don't you beat off at your house?
<s> Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
<s> History.
<s> Somethin's in my room.
<s> No students work for me.
<s> What're you doing?
<s> What're those?
<s> C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
<s> Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
<s> I don't know what it's called.
<s> Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
<s> Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
<s> Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
<s> I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
<s> I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
<s> Yes.
<s> I've been busy.
<s> He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
<s> --That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
<s> To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
<s> Who?
<s> Now wait a minute, Gerry--
<s> --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
<s> Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
<s> --I'm not angry at you--
<s> If you push him into something, if you ride him--
<s> Me too.
<s> The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
<s> Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
<s> Have you read all these books, Will?
<s> You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
<s> I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
<s> Time's up.
<s> I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
<s> Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
<s> Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
<s> I used to go with the wrench.
<s> I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
<s> What?
<s> See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
<s> You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
<s> Yes you were.
<s> You know, nothing special.
<s> No.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> It's important that I learn this.
<s> I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
<s> --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
<s> One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
<s> What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
<s> At least you have a mother.
<s> You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
<s> Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
<s> Let 'er go, Gallagher!
<s> Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
<s> But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
<s> Naw. They paroled me.
<s> Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Four.
<s> Why, I guess so.
<s> Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
<s> Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
<s> Joad. Tom Joad.
<s> We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
<s> Anything like work aroun' here?
<s> Crate fell on me.
<s> Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
<s> Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
<s> He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
<s> What you figger to do?
<s> We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
<s> Women is always tar'd.
<s> Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
<s> If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
<s> Didn' you have no breakfast?
<s> All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
<s> No plants.
<s> I'll walk back.
<s> You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
<s> Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
<s> She'll be awright.
<s> We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
<s> Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
<s> I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
<s> I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
<s> He was a good man.
<s> There, them stripy ones.
<s> Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
<s> Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
<s> We can pick anything.
<s> Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
<s> I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
<s> Wonderful.
<s> Whatever I can get away with.
<s> Fine, Bob. How are you?
<s> Insane.
<s> I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
<s> Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
<s> Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
<s> I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
<s> I think they'll probably have booze there.
<s> We haven't seen each other since high school.
<s> No.
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> You never could have kept this from me.
<s> Shouldn't you be taking notes?
<s> Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
<s> I work alone.
<s> Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
<s> We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
<s> Hey, Bob.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> --Nooo--
<s> Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
<s> It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
<s> That's going to cost.
<s> I've looked at it.
<s> Tell them my house exploded.
<s> I have always thought about her and missed her.
<s> See you in ten years.
<s> To shoot you. Correct.
<s> That's good.
<s> Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
<s> You ever just stand still for a minute?
<s> When I was first married.
<s> A jogger, huh?
<s> Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
<s> Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
<s> Five years. My son was born here.
<s> Tom.
<s> What?!
<s> I won't ask you to.
<s> I can't do this. I can't leave you...
<s> Grace, I put it on the table near your --
<s> Mom?
<s> Maybe they should put me down too.
<s> Fine -- I'll take my bath.
<s> I didn't know I had to.
<s> Little.
<s> Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
<s> You're right. Good.
<s> About what?
<s> That's not true.
<s> Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
<s> Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
<s> If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
<s> All right. Speak to you then.
<s> Sing it to me, Frankie!
<s> I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
<s> I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
<s> I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
<s> Oh, I don't know...
<s> Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
<s> Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
<s> Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
<s> I was there for that shot, actually.
<s> Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
<s> Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
<s> They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
<s> Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
<s> Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
<s> Diane!
<s> You know her?
<s> Have you talked to Tom about it?
<s> Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
<s> You're catching on.
<s> I don't know if I can with my leg.
<s> There's no hurry. Take you time.
<s> I just could never say it!
<s> No, not yet.
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
<s> Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
<s> Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
<s> Honey... I was always good.
<s> It's cool!
<s> Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
<s> The sensitive type.
<s> Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
<s> Super hero like even.
<s> Yo, brain dead, the manual!
<s> Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
<s> Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
<s> It was him, man!
<s> I'm gonna hit you!
<s> Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
<s> No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
<s> I'm taking over a TV network.
<s> Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
<s> Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
<s> I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
<s> What's this one eat?
<s> Joey's getting stupid busy.
<s> You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
<s> Make it my first born.
<s> Okay. I'll copy it.
<s> Uh, hold on...
<s> Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
<s> Yeah.
<s> They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
<s> No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
<s> I think we've got something.
<s> We caught 'em.
<s> I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
<s> You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
<s> You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
<s> Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
<s> Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
<s> Hey, it's me.
<s> I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
<s> So?
<s> Nonono, thank YOU!
<s> All right.
<s> So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
<s> My parents are going to come home early tonight.
<s> Not without Jamie.
<s> Brady! Come with us.
<s> Go!
<s> Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
<s> I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
<s> About what?
<s> I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
<s> Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
<s> Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
<s> Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> It was the nightmare man
<s> Yeah, hurry up.
<s> Oh Rachel!
<s> Why?
<s> All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
<s> Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
<s> What are we doing?
<s> Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
<s> All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
<s> Dear God.
<s> Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
<s> Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
<s> Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
<s> He shouts, too.
<s> I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
<s> Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
<s> He was watching me.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I can't.
<s> Come with me.
<s> Just answer the damn phone.
<s> I thought you were gonna get one for me.
<s> You all right?
<s> Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
<s> Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
<s> I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
<s> There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
<s> Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
<s> You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
<s> What did you use before?
<s> Oh.
<s> Are you really interested?
<s> A lot of works.
<s> And then, uh, April...huh?
<s> Oh, it's magnificent!
<s> Yeah.
<s> He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
<s> Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
<s> Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
<s> We're actresses.
<s> What makes you think we're more interesting?
<s> I cry at the opera.
<s> It's terrific!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well...
<s> Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
<s> Oh, okay.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
<s> How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
<s> Ohhhh!
<s> Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
<s> No?
<s> Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
<s> Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
<s> I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
<s> Oh, don't say those words!
<s> Not because of me, I hope.
<s> Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
<s> Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
<s> I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
<s> I know.
<s> Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
<s> Are you angry with me?
<s> Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
<s> How can we be happy?
<s> I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
<s> So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
<s> No, nothing.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
<s> ...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
<s> They're in the basement.
<s> I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
<s> You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
<s> I can't take this anymore.
<s> I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
<s> Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
<s> Yeah...but you're not dying!
<s> Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
<s> How are you?
<s> You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
<s> Like what?
<s> Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
<s> Oh, now-- 
<s> Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
<s> H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
<s> W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
<s> Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
<s> When does Frederick ever come with her?
<s> It's, uh, you never know--
<s> Really?
<s> No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
<s> They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
<s> You got it.
<s> Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
<s> I'm real upset about what you wrote.
<s> No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
<s> I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
<s> You want some?
<s> Yeah, it was.
<s> ...in a really horrible way.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> No, well...I've been trying to write.
<s> Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
<s> You've always hated my taste in the past.
<s> What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
<s> So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
<s> Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
<s> Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
<s> Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
<s> I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
<s> Just a few minutes ago.
<s> Hmm.
<s> Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
<s> I'm going to tell you later....
<s> Some museum director disappeared.
<s> ...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
<s> Orderly.
<s> I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
<s> Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
<s> Then who's buying it?
<s> <u>That's</u> the spirit...
<s> Let's keep it to business, shall we?
<s> And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
<s> I'm not.
<s> And who is "they?"
<s> All Quiet Along the Potomac...
<s> ...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
<s> Yeah, so where is he?

<s> Don't get cocky, girl.
<s> Hey really, I don't feel so great.
<s> In my heart, Heather's still alive.
<s> Because you're an idiot.
<s> Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
<s> We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
<s> Geez, don't listen to them.
<s> Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
<s> Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
<s> Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
<s> If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
<s> How very.
<s> No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
<s> S'okay....
<s> Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
<s> Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
<s> Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
<s> I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
<s> What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
<s> Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
<s> What?
<s> I thought I...you..
<s> I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
<s> Let's kick his ass.
<s> Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
<s> May<u>be</u>.
<s> Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
<s> Sure. Ciao.
<s> Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
<s> playfully shoves his hand away.
<s> pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
<s> sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
<s> I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
<s> Have a nice outing, you lot.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
<s> stands and walks toward the door.
<s> I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> That idiot boarder?
<s> You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
<s> Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
<s> Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
<s> Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
<s> You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
<s> Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
<s> Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
<s> What's the occasion?
<s> How much time off?
<s> Someone special.
<s> Where's Allison?
<s> Zero's a number right?
<s> Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
<s> Gwen, my wife's dead.
<s> You've been cheating on me haven't you?
<s> For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
<s> It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
<s> ... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
<s> Two.
<s> What things do you think you've done?
<s> All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
<s> Try stupid.
<s> I was in the can, for Chrissake.
<s> Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
<s> It was you!  I thought I heard...
<s> I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
<s> Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
<s> Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
<s> I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
<s> I understand.  How often do you see your son?
<s> I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
<s> Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
<s> I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
<s> You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
<s> You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
<s> I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
<s> Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
<s> The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
<s> Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
<s> Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
<s> How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
<s> Me!
<s> A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
<s> You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
<s> In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
<s> Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
<s> Were you in it?  In the war?
<s> I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
<s> I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
<s> Uh, no.
<s> Bodybuilding!
<s> I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
<s> She's talking to him now.
<s> We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
<s> Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
<s> Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
<s> How are they with kids?
<s> Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
<s> Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
<s> -- institution.
<s> It's a living.
<s> Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
<s> About us.
<s> 'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
<s> Bye, Neil!
<s> Uh huh.
<s> I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
<s> Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
<s> It's a nice pool, isn't it?
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> <u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
<s> He's made some friends, hasn't he?
<s> Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
<s> Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
<s> There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
<s> Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
<s> Philip!  The senior partner?
<s> Oh, honey.
<s> There might be some extras in the garage.
<s> I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
<s> I'm having the floor fixed,
<s> Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
<s> Isn't it?
<s> Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
<s> What for, dickweed?
<s> Put it out, man!
<s> It's a double.
<s> It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
<s> So?
<s> That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
<s> I learned my fill from Romeriz.
<s> It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
<s> I hear you.
<s> If it came down to it what would you do?
<s> What worries you?
<s> Where do you go when your mind drifts?
<s> No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
<s> What do you want?
<s> You got me.
<s> Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
<s> This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
<s> I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
<s> Get out.
<s> Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
<s> I know, Paul.
<s> I like my work.
<s> I know.
<s> It's not for me to decide.
<s> My dreams died long ago.
<s> Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
<s> It's happening right now.
<s> You think we should take that chance?
<s> We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
<s> For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
<s> Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
<s> Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
<s> That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
<s> What?
<s> Okay.
<s> Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
<s> There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
<s> Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
<s> Use more ice.
<s> You can't run with suitcases.
<s> Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
<s> They'll cut the power.
<s> I don't know.
<s> That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
<s> It won't be a problem.
<s> Give me an ETA.
<s> You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
<s> We'll see you in a couple of hours.
<s> But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
<s> I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
<s> That big asshole nailed my windows.
<s> We can't make the microwave work.
<s> How about dog shit?
<s> All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
<s> Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
<s> Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
<s> His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
<s> Go, Mickey.
<s> Are all of you named Jones?
<s> You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
<s> In my room.
<s> I thought they locked you in your room.
<s> Can you get into the office?
<s> How do I reach him?
<s> I'm sorry, it's a private function.
<s> Of course.
<s> I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
<s> Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
<s> Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
<s> I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
<s> I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
<s> Yes we have.
<s> We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
<s> What's happening?
<s> The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
<s> What did you overhear?
<s> Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
<s> Well rewarded Those were his words.
<s> No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
<s> I'll be over.
<s> Today.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Take the river road back. It is clear.
<s> What is it?
<s> Thank God.
<s> Give me the phone.
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
<s> This goes out live?
<s> I would never do that.
<s> He will be here.
<s> I will give you my house.
<s> Move? Where to?
<s> The third floor are low class rooms.
<s> It will do just fine.
<s> No, Odette says he's in shock.
<s> He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
<s> So where is the lamb?
<s> You cannot go alone.
<s> What?
<s> We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
<s> No! Sit down now.
<s> Paul! Then another voice.
<s> What sort of plan?
<s> Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
<s> There is one thing I need right away.
<s> Why?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> How dead?
<s> It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
<s> Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
<s> -- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
<s> -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
<s> -- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
<s> Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
<s> Is she alright?
<s> Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
<s> I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
<s> Left, goddamnit!
<s> Prove it.
<s> Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
<s> Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
<s> We're safe?
<s> Jesus!
<s> Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
<s> Oh, I think we're going to have several.
<s> Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
<s> You didn't think to ask?
<s> What?
<s> I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
<s> Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
<s> Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
<s> -- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
<s> I think I'll do what I damn well please.
<s> Well, I can't, sweetheart.
<s> Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
<s> The lockdown thing.
<s> -- it wasn't me.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Blackburn's dead.
<s> Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
<s> -- I'm coming --
<s> Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
<s> Yes.
<s> Ok...
<s> I'm scared!
<s> We'll get it later.
<s> Sure.  Did you see the others?
<s> Ok.
<s> I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
<s> Are you ok?
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
<s> Yeah, they told us this was the best.
<s> You'll have to settle for turkey.
<s> What!
<s> Aubrey?  It's mommy.
<s> I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
<s> And what would you do?
<s> You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
<s> And what did you discover?
<s> Where?
<s> I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
<s> That's great.
<s> I'll do it!
<s> And he still sits there?
<s> Buying some drugs, alright?
<s> Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
<s> Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
<s> I don't know.  Maybe.
<s> What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
<s> But how in God's name ...
<s> No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
<s> Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
<s> Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
<s> It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
<s> Gum.
<s> Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
<s> Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
<s> Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
<s> "He kicks up at anything he hears.
<s> "Every day you meet quite a few."
<s> Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
<s> Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
<s> "But we'll be the same as we started...
<s> Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
<s> Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
<s> That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
<s> Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
<s> Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
<s> Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
<s> Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
<s> I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
<s> Prison?
<s> Uh....old badminton injury.
<s> Somebody robbed the Vatican.
<s> You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
<s> This is too bad to be false.
<s> Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
<s> Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
<s> Like a "cat", one could say.
<s> I don't care.
<s> Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.

<s> The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
<s> How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
<s> Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
<s> You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
<s> Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
<s> And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
<s> They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.

<s> Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
<s> Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
<s> I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
<s> Mr. Holland?
<s> Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
<s> Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
<s> Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
<s> If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
<s> And charming?
<s> Well, I had a good time up to a point.
<s> I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
<s> I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
<s> Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
<s> No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
<s> In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
<s> It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
<s> You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
<s> Up the organization!  Bastard.
<s> No thank you. We should be off.
<s> Stuffed and baking.
<s> That one.
<s> What's on your mind? Don't --
<s> Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
<s> I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
<s> I'm not.
<s> Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
<s> Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
<s> Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
<s> Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
<s> Good night kiddo.
<s> What do you think we're doing, dad?
<s> Yeah.
<s> But what?
<s> Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
<s> Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
<s> Hi Wendy.
<s> We were just riding around.
<s> It'll warm you up.
<s> It's really quite all right.
<s> Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
<s> Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
<s> Yes.
<s> You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
<s> I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
<s> Do what?
<s> Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
<s> You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
<s> You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
<s> Yeah?
<s> Out.
<s> I dunno. I --
<s> I don't know.
<s> Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
<s> Are you his girlfriend?
<s> I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
<s> Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
<s> What's that, then?
<s> Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
<s> I had him!
<s> Too bad...
<s> But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
<s> We already did.
<s> It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
<s> Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
<s> I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
<s> And something else that might interest you.
<s> You know I remember that.
<s> Habit.
<s> We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
<s> What kind of stuff?
<s> The other guy?
<s> What was?
<s> What was it?
<s> The phone call.  The knapsack.
<s> Yes.
<s> He.  Well, he...
<s> Yes, and very beautiful.
<s> Are you the leader of tis group?
<s> Then there is nothing.
<s> It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
<s> Lestat! You knew Lestat!
<s> Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
<s> I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
<s> It will grow back again!
<s> Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
<s> Does it?
<s> Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
<s> The way I learn everything. By watching you.
<s> And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
<s> I took your life. He gave you another one.
<s> He'll never let us go.
<s> The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
<s> Yes...
<s> Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
<s> What danger?
<s> I want it!
<s> I can't do it.
<s> Yes...
<s> Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
<s> I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
<s> I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
<s> Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
<s> Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
<s> CLAUDIA!!!
<s> That's all past, Lestat.
<s> Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
<s> You have it...
<s> That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
<s> So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
<s> The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
<s> You're not lying to me, are you?
<s> I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
<s> Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
<s> He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
<s> It's over, I'm telling you...
<s> If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
<s> Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
<s> Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
<s> Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
<s> Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
<s> He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
<s> Don't even think about it.
<s> Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
<s> Why are you being like this?
<s> It's okay.
<s> To get out of Southport?
<s> Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
<s> It's in my room!
<s> Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
<s> Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
<s> Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
<s> Honey, some folks just can't fly.
<s> Hello?
<s> I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
<s> How's Julie?
<s> He's probably the only one who can help us.
<s> Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
<s> Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
<s> Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
<s> This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
<s> That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
<s> All the graves?
<s> Sleep well.
<s> No one can take my father's place.
<s> No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
<s> They shall not hurt you
<s> And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
<s> You have forgotten my last name?
<s> I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
<s> If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
<s> Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
<s> She's not too well.
<s> But that should make you like her.
<s> Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
<s> In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
<s> If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
<s> Listen to what I say --
<s> You see? Thea believes it, too!
<s> All right  all right.
<s> Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
<s> What did . . .
<s> Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
<s> What are you, a mind reader or something?
<s> Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
<s> I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
<s> I said I wish I'd never been born.
<s> You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
<s> Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
<s> You're nobody. You have no identity.
<s> Oh, well, I can't . . .
<s> Well, naturally. Of course.
<s> If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
<s> George Bailey.
<s> That's the kid.
<s> That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.
<s> No!
<s> Yes, but George . . .
<s> The Building and what?
<s> I know. I know.
<s> You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
<s> Joseph, now show him what happened today.
<s> Well, what happened to you?
<s> Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
<s> Oh . . .
<s> Goodbye, Sam.
<s> Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
<s> Hmmm?
<s> No.
<s> Look, Nick. What's wrong?
<s> Hello, Vi.
<s> Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
<s> Right down here.
<s> Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
<s> Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
<s> The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
<s> Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
<s> Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
<s> Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
<s> Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
<s> I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
<s> Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
<s> Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
<s> Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
<s> Well, then, sit down.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
<s> Going up to see Zuzu.
<s> I've eaten.
<s> Sure, sure I am.
<s> Swim for it!
<s> Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
<s> We'll take your supercargo.
<s> You're betting what you already got.
<s> Sean!  Catch it!
<s> Let's just go sailing, okay?
<s> Want to swim home?
<s> You bet.  Hang on....
<s> Oh, yeah.  Sure.
<s> N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
<s> It's still there!
<s> Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
<s> You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
<s> Got it.
<s> Is that what it is?
<s> After we've looked, we'll talk.
<s> That's it.
<s> That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
<s> So there's one around here.
<s> Why?
<s> Fooling around?
<s> Better yet.
<s> Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
<s> Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
<s> No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
<s> Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
<s> Mike's out there.
<s> What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
<s> What for?
<s> Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
<s> Now I really want to see it.
<s> That's a crock of shit.
<s> What's that mean?
<s> Just like this.
<s> I dunno.  We'll think of something.
<s> What Kids?  Who went out?
<s> I'm not sure I can.
<s> Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
<s> You always go with Andy.
<s> Brody's riding his tower.
<s> How the hell do we get him down. from there?
<s> No, I'm fine, thanks.
<s> They're acting very strange suddenly.
<s> Don't forget you have your brother.
<s> Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
<s> Honey, I gotta go.
<s> I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
<s> They just wanted to say hello.
<s> Let's not talk about that now, okay?
<s> ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
<s> Michael, the sub's dead.
<s> Make up your mind.
<s> No,  I'm not going through there.
<s> Hydrophobia...
<s> I can't take water, Kathryn.
<s> No, no.  That won't do.
<s> I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
<s> It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
<s> We're taking that shark alive!
<s> I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
<s> Afraid I can't do that.
<s> Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
<s> So do I.  But for different reasons.
<s> How'd it get in here?!
<s> And big for his age.
<s> Sure.
<s> Come on!  Check this out!
<s> Now what's this do?
<s> I am serious.
<s> Don't you dare.
<s> That?
<s> Hey.
<s> Buzz off.
<s> That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
<s> It's large enough...
<s> ... I'll go to McDonalds.
<s> I wouldn't mind going down with her.
<s> Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
<s> Yes, you can make sandwiches....
<s> He told me you both did....
<s> It sure is....
<s> I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
<s> Then don't come any closer.
<s> Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
<s> Spent it all on beer....
<s> Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
<s> I'm still five....
<s> Who's coming?
<s> Thanks for the consultation....
<s> You guys must be starving....
<s> Mom, please don't start that again....
<s> There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
<s> Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
<s> No one does till they learn....
<s> Nothing....
<s> No!
<s> What?
<s> A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
<s> What's that....?
<s> I fly elephants for smugglers....
<s> Tell Thea I'm sorry....
<s> Inch by inch....
<s> She's a tough lady....
<s> She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
<s> Oh, boy....
<s> Will you leave me alone...?
<s> Put me down, damnit....
<s> I didn't do it on purpose....
<s> Holy shit!
<s> My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
<s> How long has he been here...?
<s> Hoagie.
<s> What do you know about him?
<s> I am...You must know something about him....
<s> Maybe the gear crapped out....
<s> I live to hear the sound...You all right?
<s> Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
<s> No way....
<s> I just want to make an honest woman of you....
<s> Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
<s> Only me and Mom ..
<s> The <u>dogs</u>?
<s> It's a method for quitting smoking.
<s> Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
<s> Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
<s> O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
<s> Thank Christ we got a witness.
<s> No, you didn't.
<s> Pay me, and I shut up.
<s> He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
<s> You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
<s> I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
<s> You don't really believe this?
<s> I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
<s> Are you sure you didn't call?
<s> Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
<s> Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
<s> And did they?
<s> Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
<s> No .. But we have a theory ..
<s> I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
<s> What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
<s> No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
<s> You should. It's wonderful.
<s> Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
<s> Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
<s> Do you pray?
<s> .. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
<s> Have you known her long?
<s> I know.
<s> I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
<s> I wanna be near you ...
<s> I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
<s> Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
<s> No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
<s> No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
<s> A derelict.
<s> His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
<s> Don't annoy me, Travis.
<s> I know about the bachelor party.
<s> That's right.
<s> Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
<s> What do I do?  How do I spin this?
<s> Bill, Rod, wait --
<s> Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
<s> Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
<s> Hi.
<s> He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
<s> Sure.
<s> Happy. He said "happy?"
<s> Oh good.
<s> Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
<s> No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
<s> Fine, I just --
<s> What --
<s> He's in the living room asleep.
<s> Ten seconds, Rod.
<s> It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
<s> Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
<s> Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
<s> Why not?
<s> Forget it.  Forget it.
<s> Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
<s> Good deal, man.
<s> Hey, that's my word, okay?
<s> Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
<s> What --
<s> Well.  Good luck with that --
<s> I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
<s> --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
<s> Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
<s> I came here to let you go. _ 27.
<s> You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
<s> I'm not your brother!
<s> Hi Ray.
<s> Can you be quiet?
<s> One way to find out.
<s> Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
<s> People change.
<s> Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Just drop it Paul!
<s> Eric...
<s> Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
<s> Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
<s> We're not going anywhere, I promise.
<s> I would completely support that.
<s> How low?
<s> DAD!
<s> Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
<s> I thought you were an expert.
<s> Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
<s> Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
<s> Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
<s> Goodbye, Alan.
<s> You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
<s> Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
<s> But then you never get to go in space.
<s> You should.
<s> No we're not.
<s> Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
<s> Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
<s> Back out! Move!
<s> If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
<s> No.  I feel something.
<s> Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
<s> The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
<s> Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
<s> No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
<s> Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
<s> Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
<s> I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
<s> I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
<s> Possible.
<s> Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> It has a broken leg!
<s> I have to find Kelly!
<s> What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
<s> Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
<s> Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
<s> Maybe.  Maybe not.
<s> What?
<s> Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
<s> You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
<s> How would we cut off the lysine?
<s> Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
<s> I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
<s> Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
<s> Look.
<s> Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
<s> The - - agility.  You're right!
<s> Dilophosaurus.
<s> Alan!
<s> What's that?
<s> You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
<s> We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
<s> That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
<s> Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
<s> Machines hate you?
<s> Kids get scared.
<s> When you gotta go, you gotta go.
<s> I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
<s> - - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
<s> We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
<s> Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
<s> Let's get you out.
<s> Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
<s> No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
<s> I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
<s> Please!
<s> Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
<s> There's no sign of him anywhere.
<s> They don't bother me.
<s> And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
<s> You have a map.
<s> Who is this? What's going on?
<s> And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
<s> I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
<s> _Krueger_...
<s> Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
<s> So?
<s> So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
<s> Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
<s> Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
<s> Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
<s> For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
<s> You have been hearing the sordid side then.
<s> What is it really?
<s> Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
<s> In a manner of speaking.
<s> Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
<s> Then its authority is in doubt.
<s> Yes.
<s> I do.
<s> No.
<s> Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
<s> And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
<s> Tonight?
<s> I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
<s> Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
<s> First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
<s> Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
<s> -- Accident and Compensation Association.
<s> You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
<s> "Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
<s> On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
<s> Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
<s> Orlac is an account?
<s> Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
<s> We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
<s> You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
<s> It's ... lovely.
<s> To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
<s> I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
<s> We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
<s> We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
<s> An ape ... some kind of ape.
<s> It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
<s> Well we're pretty --
<s> We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
<s> -- Yes.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
<s> No, I'm look --
<s> What about everything since?
<s> Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
<s> I go on rounds.
<s> And I don't think that was Tom.
<s> It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
<s> Not much point to this, is there?
<s> I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
<s> -- Then you don't need me.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't get you.
<s> You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
<s> Yup.
<s> What am I supposed to say?
<s> Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
<s> No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
<s> I don't think so.
<s> They don't scare me any more.
<s> How is it back there?
<s> Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
<s> Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
<s> All right, but I'm going to see that list.
<s> No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
<s> Goodbye, Pete.
<s> Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
<s> Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
<s> Nobody's seen that.
<s> Yes sir, we know he --
<s> Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
<s> He's in his room, playing.
<s> Not particularly.
<s> I see you have people there. What are their names?
<s> I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
<s> I'm allergic to onions.
<s> Oh, for God's sake...Here.
<s> Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
<s> Good night.
<s> Sure.
<s> Uh huh...
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> I guess about the same kind of things you do.
<s> Where will my toys be?
<s> Yes, your honor.
<s> Six years.
<s> How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
<s> Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
<s> Eight, almost nine years.
<s> Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
<s> No.
<s> How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
<s> Yes.
<s> Fine.
<s> Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
<s> Joanna, what the hell is--
<s> No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
<s> Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
<s> Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
<s> What?!?
<s> Kramer--
<s> Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
<s> No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
<s> First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
<s> Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
<s> It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
<s> Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
<s> How the hell are you going to do that?
<s> She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
<s> But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
<s> I'm gonna keep him, why?
<s> Got it.
<s> I'm sure.
<s> No.  I don't think so.
<s> What?
<s> Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
<s> You and Charley?
<s> Ha!  You tell me.
<s> Cow.
<s> It is alright, Father.
<s> Can I do anything I want?
<s> Can I free the prisoners?
<s> The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
<s> We did not.
<s> We do not know.
<s> Roughly five thousand men.
<s> When it is time.
<s> The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
<s> Pretend.
<s> You cannot.
<s> The Chinese.
<s> But, I have no experience.
<s> Eliminate you.
<s> We cannot.
<s> How could I ever leave?
<s> No.  Do you?
<s> Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
<s> I'll need any and all topographic studies.
<s> No!!  Out!
<s> No crocodile has ever--
<s> You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
<s> I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
<s> Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
<s> You do?
<s> Tranq guns down, rifles up!
<s> Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
<s> Could we have intercourse?
<s> We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
<s> Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
<s> How would <u>you</u> know, what--
<s> I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
<s> I'm sorry but you're...
<s> Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
<s> We seem to say goodnight a lot.
<s> Good idea.
<s> Well...
<s> He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
<s> Likewise.
<s> So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
<s> Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
<s> What kind of backup do we have?
<s> Was he swallowed?
<s> Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You think Jack's handsome?
<s> I don't know.  Back the truck--
<s> I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
<s> Else.
<s> A tooth?
<s> Wild guess.
<s> It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
<s> Well, except for the one girl.
<s> Agent Mapp! Thank you!
<s> I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
<s> You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
<s> Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
<s> The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
<s> I think we may be, yes.
<s> And what is that, sir?
<s> Murdered...? How?
<s> Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
<s> I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
<s> I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
<s> Did you ever work with her?
<s> Yes.
<s> I didn't.
<s> Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
<s> I never thought about it.
<s> Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
<s> Mmm. And what else...?
<s> How long did you live there?
<s> Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
<s> How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
<s> No. We just -
<s> All right, then tell me how -
<s> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
<s> I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
<s> Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
<s> Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
<s> Officer Starling. Welcome back.
<s> Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
<s> Let us go, miss.
<s> Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
<s> In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
<s> Sorry to disappoint you...
<s> Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
<s> "Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
<s> And by sea!
<s> Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
<s> It can be dangerous...
<s> What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
<s> That is sedition! Treason!
<s> Your enemy...
<s> I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
<s> That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
<s> It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
<s> Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
<s> The decision is final.
<s> Fire!
<s> Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
<s> That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
<s> Carry them to England to your King with pride.
<s> France.
<s> Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
<s> Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
<s> Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
<s> No.
<s> Just get in yours!
<s> There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
<s> Good...It's going good.
<s> I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
<s> Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
<s> How much time does that give us?
<s> Can't we fix it?
<s> Where's Doc?!
<s> You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
<s> Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
<s> Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
<s> Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
<s> Ahhhh!
<s> Okay.
<s> Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
<s> I signed-up for the stock option.
<s> Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
<s> Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
<s> And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
<s> Who cares?
<s> 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
<s> What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
<s> We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
<s> I don't know.  I'm guessing.
<s> I ought to smack your face!
<s> DeJesus...It's got him.
<s> Oh man, that's just great...
<s> Tip top, Willie...tip top.
<s> Answer them and quit kicking me!
<s> I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
<s> The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
<s> You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
<s> If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
<s> Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
<s> Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
<s> We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
<s> The stupid bastards! Count it!
<s> We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
<s> What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
<s> No.
<s> All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
<s> Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
<s> You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
<s> For half a million?
<s> Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
<s> You know it doesn't include the amp.
<s> Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
<s> How the fuck should I know?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Leave your sister out of it.
<s> Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> You really want to know, sir?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
<s> He'll live.
<s> He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
<s> Yes, Sergeant.
<s> September '97, that's all she wrote.
<s> Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
<s> Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
<s> Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
<s> What?
<s> I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
<s> You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
<s> They fought against the Indians?
<s> I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
<s> You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
<s> You lived in the States for a while?
<s> I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
<s> You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
<s> I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
<s> If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
<s> He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
<s> You know who it was they dug up?
<s> Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
<s> Appreciate it, sir.
<s> I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
<s> We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
<s> And people make their choice--
<s> You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
<s> Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
<s> They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
<s> I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
<s> Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
<s> '57, 1 believe--
<s> We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
<s> When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
<s> Right.
<s> Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
<s> No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
<s> I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
<s> And the ten thousand?
<s> The Perdido thing?
<s> I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
<s> I was too busy.
<s> You ever play one of these?
<s> For a while.
<s> I'm surprised he bothered with it.
<s> So I've heard--
<s> Well, you were working there--
<s> You've got your mother, your kids--
<s> Pilar--
<s> More, I hope.
<s> I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
<s> I'm going over to the other side.
<s> No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
<s> You sell much out here?
<s> He's gonna find out.
<s> You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
<s> I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
<s> I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
<s> Right.
<s> He won't.
<s> You'll do more.than that.
<s> Yes.
<s> I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
<s> He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
<s> No it isn't.  You can't help me.
<s> Hang on!
<s> You can't.
<s> The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
<s> Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
<s> Mine.
<s> You know of him?
<s> Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
<s> Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
<s> A ticket home,
<s> She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
<s> Yes.  It's regrettable
<s> Shut up!
<s> Yes.
<s> Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
<s> A Mister Quaid?
<s> And what does Jennifer think's real?
<s> Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
<s> What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
<s> You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
<s> I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
<s> Have you been in?
<s> He's better off this way.
<s> You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
<s> In my time, and nobody else's.
<s> No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
<s> Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
<s> I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
<s> No!
<s> Bob, it's me.
<s> I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
<s> No.
<s> No way.
<s> Ok.
<s> No, you smiled.
<s> Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
<s> But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
<s> Where'd you grow up?
<s> How old is she?
<s> Yeah, look at that thing.
<s> I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
<s> Hello, can I have room 5601.
<s> Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
<s> What?
<s> But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
<s> Ok, I will... later.
<s> Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
<s> Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
<s> She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
<s> Bad?
<s> I can't believe Will killed him.
<s> On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
<s> Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
<s> Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
<s> My secretary?
<s> I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
<s> I think I should join you.
<s> And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
<s> Something he said, just before...
<s> Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
<s> Yes.  We won, that's right.
<s> Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
<s> Peter Kelson?
<s> Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
<s> It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
<s> I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
<s> I had to.
<s> If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
<s> That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
<s> I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
<s> What are these?
<s> You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
<s> Not a lot.
<s> Whish the circumstances were different.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
<s> Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
<s> Dad around?
<s> How is he?
<s> To that stewardess?
<s> You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
<s> What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> She's alright.
<s> But you use potato?
<s> The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
<s> You're a caterer?
<s> You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
<s> I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
<s> I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Four days.
<s> Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
<s> Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
<s> Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
<s> Found?  I'm not some charity case.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> What?
<s> The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
<s> Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
<s> Just one word of advice for next season.
<s> How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
<s> How's that been?
<s> Lucky.
<s> What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
<s> I don't care.
<s> I know this.  What do you want?
<s> Who said I'm not getting recruited?
<s> God, here we go.
<s> I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
<s> With a jacked-up attitude.
<s> He ain't Spalding.
<s> So you took Shawnee, huh?
<s> I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
<s> None of your business.
<s> Fine, Quincy.
<s> Plan to.
<s> Why not?
<s> Nobody.
<s> Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
<s> Not really.
<s> Are you out of your mind?
<s> Few days ago.
<s> Not for Quincy McCall.
<s> A rest?
<s> Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
<s> What?
<s> I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
<s> What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
<s> I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
<s> We were just studying.
<s> I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
<s> Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
<s> What mess?
<s> Tell me what?
<s> Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
<s> I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
<s> I don't know.
<s> No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
<s> I'm really only equipped to take orders --
<s> Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
<s> I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
<s> Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
<s> I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
<s> I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
<s> You don't have a boyfriend?
<s> Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
<s> You just move in here?
<s> I'm a bit of a slob myself.
<s> Arlight, then.  Cheers.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> yeah, good, ok.
<s> Well...is that illegal?
<s> I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
<s> What?
<s> Diet Coke.
<s> Cynthia?
<s> I should maybe go to the bathroom.
<s> Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
<s> Sorry, little man.
<s> -- and I'm through playin' games.
<s> What's up?
<s> Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
<s> You're a friend of the family I presume?
<s> Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
<s> Gently, son --
<s> "It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
<s> Braces.
<s> You were gonna ask me weren't you?
<s> PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
<s> Where is he?
<s> No.
<s> I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
<s> Is Jack your son?
<s> I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
<s> You got us a room so quick?
<s> Let's talk about --
<s> So boring, so useless --
<s> -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
<s> So you sat it out, that's what you did?
<s> "Go Get 'Em, Honey."
<s> I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
<s> Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
<s> About three weeks ago.
<s> I'm really sorry.
<s> ...ok...
<s> OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
<s> I went out last night.
<s> It's ten o'clock in the morning --
<s> I didn't hear anything.
<s> I don't have to do a god damn thing.
<s> -- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
<s> Yes.
<s> Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
<s> Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
<s> She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
<s> We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
<s> Well maybe.
<s> Do you know the answer to this?
<s> You're her boyfriend?
<s> Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
<s> Like what?
<s> I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
<s> I'm trying to help, Linda --
<s> You need to sober up.
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> ...I don't....
<s> Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
<s> Thank you.
<s> We need more dog food --
<s> -- I didn't see you from the window.
<s> I didn't know the answer --
<s> I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
<s> Hi.
<s> It's not right.
<s> I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
<s> And you were not hurt?
<s> That is good.
<s> No, stay back!  Stay back!
<s> If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
<s> I wish to discuss your brother.
<s> Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
<s> You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
<s> You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
<s> You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
<s> Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
<s> Those can be adopted --
<s> Three days??!!
<s> But -- what is Porthos doing?
<s> Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
<s> Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
<s> Well... Well... Okay.
<s> He is right, d'Artagnan.
<s> Perhaps this will help.
<s> Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
<s> I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
<s> Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
<s> What is its antidote?
<s> Whose rooms are those?
<s> I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
<s> Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
<s> There.
<s> I am unhurt --
<s> ... Two-thirty-seven.
<s> Yes, yes, go on.
<s> Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
<s> That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
<s> A letter.  May I see?
<s> You would do that, your Majesty?
<s> Sire, I --
<s> Oh Louis, Louis...
<s> Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
<s> You mean shut your ass down!
<s> Did you report it stolen?
<s> Fine -
<s> Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
<s> Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
<s> I'll live...
<s> That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
<s> Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
<s> Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
<s> I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
<s> So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
<s> It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
<s> They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
<s> What else is new?
<s> A bank?
<s> I'm not going anywhere!
<s> Hop in.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
<s> If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
<s> He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
<s> Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
<s> I have to.
<s> I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
<s> What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
<s> You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
<s> You said the guy down here is good.
<s> Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
<s> Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
<s> Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
<s> After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
<s> That's narrow?
<s> When I'm done.
<s> It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
<s> Don't talk to me!!
<s> Have him peel the top label back.
<s> Wait for the back-up! Will?
<s> He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
<s> They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
<s> It'll do fine.
<s> Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
<s> I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
<s> I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> I'm very scared.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Please, no.
<s> 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
<s> Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
<s> It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
<s> Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
<s> Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
<s> And you said?
<s> Huh?  Will? Is that you?
<s> Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
<s> Tell me about yourself.
<s> Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
<s> Will?  You could come up here.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
<s> I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
<s> Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
<s> With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
<s> No.
<s> Stuart is fine.
<s> I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> That's interesting.
<s> Yes. I'd considered it.
<s> I haven't decided yet.
<s> Do you know how you caught me, Will?
<s> I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
<s> Fight what?
<s> You got it.
<s> I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
<s> "No"?  "No" to which part??
<s> I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
<s> I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
<s> Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
<s> There'll be other shots.
<s> Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
<s> Deal.
<s> Okay, great!  So let's reset!
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
<s> No thanks.
<s> I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
<s> No!  Andy, don't do it --
<s> What is this, World War Two...?
<s> No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
<s> Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
<s> Yes, your Holiness?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
<s> I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
<s> Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
<s> Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
<s> Should Tank I.D. it?
<s> Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
<s> Really?
<s> What happened to them?
<s> How?
<s> I got you.
<s> Are they any agent?
<s> Go.
<s> They'll be able to track it.
<s> Yes.
<s> The agents --
<s> What do you know?
<s> It's an honor.
<s> What truth?
<s> I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
<s> For what?
<s> Because... I didn't think I would?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Of the Resistance.
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
<s> Morpheus, I don't know --
<s> Good.
<s> How did you know...?
<s> Who?
<s> What?
<s> Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
<s> How do you know that name?
<s> It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
<s> What choice?
<s> I believe I can bring him back.
<s> Do what?
<s> I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
<s> Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
<s> Tank, it's me.
<s> So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
<s> I'll be all right.
<s> Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
<s> 'And with your spirit.'
<s> Jewish...
<s> So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
<s> Thanks for the ride.
<s> Panther!  Same thing...
<s> I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
<s> Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
<s> Listen...I'm a guest here.
<s> That's not going to help.
<s> Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
<s> I'll be here.  Don't worry.
<s> No.
<s> Good idea.
<s> What pipes?
<s> Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
<s> Ok...that's it.
<s> C'mon Johnny.
<s> Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
<s> Yeah, where's the rest?
<s> You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
<s> Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
<s> Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
<s> All right.
<s> It's all right.
<s> An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
<s> Anything specific?
<s> You're intolerable today.
<s> Well you can't blame them in a way.
<s> You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
<s> Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
<s> Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
<s> I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
<s> Yeah, so things'll be even.
<s> We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
<s> Well...no.
<s> Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
<s> You what?
<s> Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
<s> Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
<s> He's coming.
<s> Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
<s> Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
<s> I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
<s> But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
<s> What 'business'?
<s> Why yes, thank you.
<s> Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
<s> Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
<s> I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
<s> Me, too.
<s> Like a marriage made in heaven?
<s> As close as a deal could be.
<s> What?!
<s> Uh -- he's from out of town --
<s> I get the feeling you've done some business before.
<s> I thought this was practically a done deal --
<s> Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
<s> Yours.
<s> Certainly.  Goodnight.
<s> Bontecou wants a quick response and --
<s> Certainly, Bill.
<s> The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
<s> 'It's up to Joe'?
<s> Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
<s> The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
<s> He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
<s> No, no.  I on holiday.
<s> No.  Nothing.
<s> No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
<s> But she loves you?
<s> Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
<s> I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
<s> I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
<s> I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
<s> I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
<s> That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
<s> I don't know.
<s> To bed.
<s> Why don't you get off his case?
<s> I said get out.
<s> I don't know who you are.
<s> I am.
<s> Nowhere?  I'm...here.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> And you can't tell me who you are.
<s> -- That was the place... and you were the guy.
<s> -- Yes?
<s> No.
<s> That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
<s> Good morning, Bill.
<s> 'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
<s> Can you keep a secret?
<s> This part I'm interested in.
<s> Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
<s> Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
<s> It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<s> Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
<s> Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
<s> I don't!
<s> It's enough now.
<s> Quiet.
<s> How's that, Quince?
<s> Thank you, Quince.
<s> No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
<s> Sure.
<s> Yes, I believe I do.
<s> You think Drew will go for it?
<s> Uh oh --
<s> You're not listening --
<s> That's all?
<s> Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
<s> Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
<s> What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
<s> No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
<s> Oh, yes --
<s> Not at all.  It was fascinating.
<s> You never know.  Lightning could strike.
<s> Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
<s> Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
<s> I'm sorry... um... ?
<s> I have no memory.
<s> What's it like?
<s> Couple days.
<s> Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
<s> Leonard.
<s> * I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
<s> Who did this to you?
<s> Yeah, I remember you.
<s> Did you?
<s> She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
<s> They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
<s> Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
<s> Where is he?
<s> I told him about your car.
<s> Help me.
<s> I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
<s> Sweet.
<s> We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
<s> I guess I've told you about my condition.
<s> Mr Gammell?
<s> John Gammell?
<s> Fucking hope not.
<s> From who?
<s> Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
<s> I won't be happy until you leave town.
<s> How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
<s> Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
<s> There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
<s> No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
<s> I never said he was faking! I never said that!
<s> Lemon or lime?
<s> Turn around.
<s> So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
<s> Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
<s> 25% discount on the load.
<s> Havana.
<s> Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
<s> Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
<s> Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
<s> I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
<s> We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
<s> What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
<s> Five minutes...
<s> Verdado.
<s> And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
<s> You think I am in so deep I forgot?
<s> Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
<s> Okay.  What's up?
<s> How do I discuss operations over an open line?
<s> NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
<s> How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
<s> I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
<s> Sonny...?
<s> Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
<s> How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
<s> He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
<s> Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
<s> You're hoping to get a look at what?
<s> It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
<s> I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
<s> Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
<s> What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
<s> Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
<s> What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
<s> Rico. Rico Rizzo.
<s> And what?
<s> They gotta be.
<s> I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
<s> I'm wet.
<s> No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
<s> No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
<s> Well, not too, I mean, a little.
<s> Uh, yessir.
<s> No. You got it.
<s> Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
<s> ... and taxi fare for me.
<s> I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
<s> ...He had a bald skull and...
<s> History, man, history. How much?
<s> Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
<s> What?
<s> Nah, just covered with batshit!
<s> ...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
<s> Oh Jesus! 
<s> I'll pay extra
<s> Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
<s> Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
<s> Hello.
<s> Where is it?
<s> It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
<s> Maybe he's changing jobs.
<s> Cat, ah!  Ayip!
<s> Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
<s> It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
<s> Who got the Frenchman out?
<s> What's your name?
<s> Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
<s> Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
<s> Shit.
<s> Weird shit...?
<s> New York's finest.
<s> I think so. One right, two lefts...
<s> Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
<s> Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
<s> Depends.  You got a memo?
<s> Go!! Just go!!
<s> I pull.
<s> Nino, please...
<s> Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
<s> Please.
<s> Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
<s> So?
<s> Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
<s> I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
<s> Fuck! It broke the skin...
<s> I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
<s> How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
<s> I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
<s> Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
<s> It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
<s> I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
<s> Yeah, thanks.
<s> I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
<s> Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
<s> If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
<s> That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
<s> Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
<s> You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
<s> It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
<s> The what?
<s> What?
<s> Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
<s> Why would you lose me?
<s> Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
<s> Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
<s> Maybe.
<s> You don't know?
<s> You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
<s> Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
<s> What?
<s> Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
<s> No, the typing kind.
<s> I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
<s> I am. Well, maybe not completely--
<s> All done, chief..
<s> How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
<s> I suppose I did.
<s> To do what?
<s> Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
<s> In other words, you're calling her a flake.
<s> It's that time.  Go.
<s> Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
<s> I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
<s> We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
<s> Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
<s> Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
<s> Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
<s> Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
<s> Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
<s> Which is?
<s> Five, six-hundred thousand.
<s> This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
<s> Yes?
<s> Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
<s> I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
<s> I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
<s> Why did you phrase it like that?
<s> Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
<s> - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
<s> Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
<s> Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
<s> She sacrificed herself..
<s> Yes, I gathered as much.
<s> Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
<s> Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
<s> I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
<s> Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
<s> Good job.  And thanks.
<s> You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
<s> I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
<s> They'll kill me.
<s> His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
<s> So what do you suggest?
<s> What about him...?
<s> And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
<s> Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
<s> Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
<s> If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
<s> Who is "they?"
<s> I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
<s> Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
<s> I'm going to answer it.
<s> You didn't have to.........
<s> We did what we had to do.
<s> Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
<s> Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
<s> Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
<s> You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
<s> You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
<s> Now I want you to hold onto it.
<s> Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
<s> Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
<s> Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
<s> That depends.
<s> Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
<s> What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
<s> Jack.
<s> Give me a break, Pops.
<s> Why?
<s> I'd say you've got about two minutes.
<s> A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
<s> Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
<s> Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
<s> Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
<s> And get a doctor.
<s> Why you drinking so much?
<s> Ti amo.
<s> Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Alright. I didn't see you here.
<s> You have too many dogs.
<s> Maybe I should come back another time.
<s> Where are you taking me?
<s> Get all of me. Take everything.
<s> You're trying to make me feel guilty.
<s> She didn't like me.
<s> I can't do that!
<s> I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
<s> I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
<s> I know what I know.
<s> You're late!
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. I'm gonna wait.
<s> No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
<s> What?
<s> Alright.
<s> My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
<s> You've made me very happy, Johnny.
<s> And who's gonna pay for that?
<s> Where you been?
<s> Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
<s> Well. I don't really know where to start.
<s> No. Are you drunk?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Definitely!
<s> Sure!
<s> I am alone in the world.
<s> What happened?
<s> Absolutely!
<s> There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
<s> I'm a housewife.
<s> Yes.
<s> Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
<s> Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
<s> She looks like one. Yes, she does.
<s> Did you dress her up like this?
<s> Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
<s> It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
<s> I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
<s> Yes!
<s> All of us are ... we are all Britons.
<s> No one live there.
<s> I am your king!
<s> NI!   NI!
<s> One that looks nice.
<s> That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
<s> We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
<s> No, no ... not "is"!
<s> What?
<s> I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
<s> What!  Just a flesh wound. 
<s> 'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
<s> This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
<s> Just keep me covered.
<s> Be quiet!
<s> Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
<s> ... Well, we did do the nose.
<s> Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
<s> Blue.
<s> What is the capital of Assyria?
<s> He hasn't got shit all over him.
<s> I'm not quite dead, sir ...
<s> Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
<s> Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
<s> Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
<s> Well ... I'll tell you ...
<s> Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
<s> No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
<s> The Prince ... ?
<s> Oh ... hello ...
<s> Ector.
<s> Back to your bed!  At once!
<s> Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
<s> Brave, Sir Rob ...
<s> You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
<s> I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
<s> John, it's not your problem what she eats.
<s> I can't let her down now, Archie.
<s> Oh, I'm much more than that.
<s> You know nothing about her!
<s> I can't move to tidy.
<s> Of course.
<s> A situation?
<s> Quite.
<s> And that is my last word on the matter.
<s> Aye, do.
<s> I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Occasionally.
<s> The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
<s> For once in my life, I am not the issue.
<s> Archie.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
<s> And I intend to be there when she's ready.
<s> That doesn't make him an expert.
<s> To keep out the cold.
<s> Have I ever let you down before--?
<s> Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
<s> In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
<s> Yes.
<s> So?
<s> To know when he'll be king.
<s> Who?
<s> It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
<s> Cold is good!
<s> I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
<s> Just them?
<s> I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
<s> I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
<s> Of course, at once.
<s> We were expecting you to return by six.
<s> Again?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> He is sick, ma'am.
<s> If I tell you, then it's no fun.
<s> Yeah...
<s> But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
<s> No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
<s> Sure.
<s> And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
<s> One.  In case...
<s> We don't have a choice!
<s> Never been on a snowboard.
<s> Hold my keys, then.
<s> Then we'll go home.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
<s> Not yet, honey...
<s> It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
<s> The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
<s> One.
<s> You're an understandin' fella.
<s> I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
<s> Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
<s> Well, I ...
<s> You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
<s> That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
<s> Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
<s> Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
<s> But you won't.
<s> May I have your name please?
<s> I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
<s> I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
<s> Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> What is it? What do you see?!
<s> What ... I..HAVE... to do.
<s> And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
<s> No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<s> Damn, that's a long drive.
<s> Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
<s> Yeah, I'd say that's it.
<s> What's going on ?
<s> You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
<s> You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
<s> Why would he ? His parents are rich.
<s> Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
<s> I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
<s> I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
<s> This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
<s> It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
<s> It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
<s> That's a shame.
<s> Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
<s> Because of my charming personality ?
<s> You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
<s> Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
<s> In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
<s> What ?
<s> Fire the whole division.
<s> Sir ?
<s> Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
<s> We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
<s> Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
<s> Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, Excuse me for a second.
<s> Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
<s> What the hell kind of cop are you ?
<s> I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
<s> We made it !
<s> I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
<s> UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
<s> Ohhhhh.
<s> My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
<s> You're still asking me to break the law.
<s> Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
<s> Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
<s> Was it a nice funeral?
<s> Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
<s> I love you too sweetie, bye.
<s> Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
<s> You are?
<s> Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
<s> I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
<s> It's just a corpse.
<s> It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
<s> That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
<s> It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
<s> Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
<s> I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
<s> I want juice!
<s> I won't.
<s> No THANKS!
<s> And you're gonna solve the mystery?
<s> Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
<s> Just remember the needle in the haystack.
<s> Oh my gosh, here it is!
<s> You would.
<s> Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
<s> Oh no?!?!?!
<s> Good. I mean...
<s> No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
<s> You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
<s> Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
<s> Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
<s> How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
<s> Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
<s> You know how I feel about you.
<s> Nothing, nothing at all.
<s> No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
<s> Yeah, it would be kinda great.
<s> Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
<s> He is?
<s> This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
<s> Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
<s> Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
<s> It's her home! It's where she lives!!
<s> Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
<s> What?
<s> Yes they are.
<s> Deceased.
<s> Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
<s> What's that?
<s> Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
<s> Are you mad at me?
<s> Did she ever see Vada?
<s> In ages, I know, me neither.
<s> Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
<s> Okay.
<s> Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
<s> Ahh, maybe next summer.
<s> In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
<s> That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
<s> I'm very nervous.
<s> That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
<s> Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
<s> It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
<s> Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
<s> Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
<s> That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
<s> Why do you think she says that?
<s> You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
<s> Oh great!!
<s> Yes!!
<s> Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
<s> Well he just left, what's wrong?
<s> Uh huh.
<s> They're just fun to read.
<s> That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
<s> Why? It's not dinner time yet.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't DO that!!
<s> Duck!
<s> What?
<s> So?
<s> Hi, wanna ride bikes?
<s> Really?
<s> Then go home, baby.
<s> Leave then, some friend you are.
<s> I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
<s> But then I won't be able to see anything.
<s> Umm, Ummmmm
<s> Well, let's spit on it.
<s> I should look different.
<s> Part of being a New Yorker.
<s> He's still in love with you.
<s> Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
<s> Go figure you.
<s> It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
<s> That was Thursday.
<s> Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
<s> Good girl.
<s> Well, we're...
<s> Can you watch the road?
<s> ... you hate weddings, you never go.
<s> ... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
<s> So your honeymoon is exactly where?
<s> Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
<s> ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
<s> ... whatever is manly and independent.
<s> Only.  If he wants to.
<s> Don't you see...
<s> ... look good on Kimberly.
<s> I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
<s> Till the gas ran out.
<s> I got the point.
<s> Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
<s> ... maybe it's congratulations.
<s> It's over.
<s> Lower.
<s> I came here, looking for her.
<s> This is where I proposed.
<s> Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
<s> No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
<s> To him.
<s> Well, if that's the way you f...
<s> This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
<s> You're much more his type.
<s> Is there food?
<s> Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
<s> I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
<s> Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
<s> Who the hell is he?
<s> What!
<s> Hi. Come on in. Mary!
<s> Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
<s> D.C.
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
<s> Sure he will.
<s> I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
<s> Replacement party.
<s> Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
<s> Next you'll be sick.
<s> Bet the sheets are grey.
<s> Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
<s> I've been a Little dyspeptic.
<s> Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
<s> It just is.
<s> He's a member of our congregation.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
<s> Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
<s> Wow!
<s> That's unkind.
<s> What?
<s> What...?  0h, yes.
<s> You sound different. Is that really you?
<s> Hello.
<s> You're real favorites of his.
<s> You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
<s> Do they have a show to give it to you?
<s> Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
<s> He ain't really new.
<s> He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
<s> No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
<s> I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
<s> You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
<s> You serious?
<s> Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
<s> What?
<s> She was born without a tongue.
<s> What?
<s> Ready.
<s> Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
<s> She doesn't talk?
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
<s> No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
<s> Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
<s> Says who?
<s> Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
<s> No.
<s> Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
<s> I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
<s> Yes.
<s> That's the way of the world.
<s> We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
<s> Would the network really not run it without the interview?
<s> When do you want the assembly?
<s> Slate it.
<s> Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
<s> Really?
<s> No thanks.
<s> You think so, Frankie?
<s> I'll smile when it's funny.
<s> Where's Wilma?
<s> 'That right? I thought he was up North.
<s> No. Just me.  Me an' her.
<s> No. I'm new in town.
<s> Oh yeah? That's my home town.
<s> What d'you expect?
<s> I like a place with lots of life.
<s> What is it?
<s> Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
<s> Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
<s> No.
<s> That's the way he is.
<s> Are you married?
<s> No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
<s> She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
<s> You didn't answer my question.
<s> You jivin' me?
<s> What about your boy?
<s> I keep thinking about him.
<s> Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Watch out!
<s> I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
<s> How 'bout the key?
<s> 'Bye, Jocko.
<s> Who're you?
<s> Wouldn't have known you.
<s> Great.
<s> She don't look no worse to me.
<s> Hell, I'm just like him.
<s> I guess I ain't.
<s> I guess not.
<s> You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
<s> 'Musta knocked her up.
<s> I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
<s> Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
<s> What's the matter?! You mad at me?
<s> What's the matter now?
<s> Omar, listen to me--
<s> I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
<s> Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
<s> Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
<s> He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
<s> You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
<s> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<s> Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
<s> Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
<s> Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
<s> You're pleasant tonight.
<s> You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
<s> How are we doing?
<s> It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
<s> How's the ice?
<s> Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
<s> I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
<s> I thought you already left.
<s> I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
<s> So you're a wire junkie.
<s> Put the gun down, Case.
<s> I don't sleep much. You packed?
<s> Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
<s> I'll be okay.
<s> That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
<s> What is it?
<s> Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
<s> I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
<s> Well, do you?
<s> Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
<s> Right. 7:30.
<s> YOU KNIT?
<s> And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
<s> 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
<s> Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
<s> Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
<s> Betty.
<s> But I don't want it straightened out.
<s> And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
<s> Oh. Right.
<s> Have you been there?
<s> He's my teacher!
<s> Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
<s> Dude, you rock!
<s> Yeah, you gonna be there?
<s> No it's not. Guys name their penises.
<s> See!
<s> Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
<s> Do you remember high school?
<s> Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
<s> Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
<s> Don't look down!
<s> Why do you do that?
<s> Wow. You believe in me that much--
<s> Wait, I was going to tell you--
<s> I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
<s> I finally found my story.
<s> What?
<s> Nah uh.
<s> <i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
<s> <i>                      Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<s> For this.
<s> I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<s> Can't you make other creations?
<s> It's not the gas, Dad!
<s> Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
<s> I'm sorry...
<s> I don't know.
<s> Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
<s> I don't know - into the air I suppose.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> C'mon, cut it out.
<s> I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
<s> Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
<s> I can't!
<s> Hi.
<s> Hi, Kerry.
<s> All of them.
<s> Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
<s> First door up the stairs.
<s> Hi Mom.
<s> Deal.  Thanks.
<s> No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
<s> I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
<s> You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
<s> I don't know.
<s> He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
<s> But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
<s> But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
<s> We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
<s> Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
<s> Call me Nancy.
<s> Remember -- open mind.
<s> Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
<s> Everybody take five.
<s> Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
<s> I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
<s> Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
<s> Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
<s> Neil, please --
<s> How do we get in?
<s> What?
<s> No.  We're alone.
<s> Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
<s> Don't worry, it won't come to that.
<s> I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
<s> Night, night, Honey.
<s> Films mainly.
<s> Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
<s> Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
<s> I forgot my bag.
<s> Hi.
<s> You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
<s> Okay.
<s> You abide by rules like that?
<s> I don't know, I'm afraid.
<s> I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
<s> No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
<s> Hand it over.  Basic plot?
<s> 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
<s> You have a stunt bottom?
<s> Okay.
<s> You and every person in this country.
<s> Undressed like this, yes.
<s> I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
<s> Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
<s> I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
<s> Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Anna Scott?
<s> Yes -- sort of...
<s> What?
<s> Is Miss Scott staying here?
<s> Shame!
<s> And we intend to use them!
<s> Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
<s> The others?
<s> This is Henry James film?
<s> Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
<s> Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
<s> Definitely no comment.
<s> May I help you, sir?
<s> I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
<s> This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
<s> What are the choices?
<s> Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
<s> I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
<s> Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
<s> Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
<s> Why not?
<s> Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
<s> Yes.
<s> Fabulous.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> I haven't got a book down my trousers.
<s> Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
<s> Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
<s> I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
<s> I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
<s> I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
<s> Will you come with me, please.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Sorry, ma'am.
<s> Go on...
<s> Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
<s> B-B-Billy.
<s> O-o-o-oh...
<s> Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
<s> I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
<s> C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
<s> Good boy, thank you, Billy.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Wow! They're so quiet.
<s> What for?
<s> They went that way.
<s> My feet hurt...
<s> I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
<s> Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
<s> Lobotomy?
<s> I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
<s> You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
<s> Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
<s> That's nice. Send me a post card.
<s> I just started!
<s> Hold it!
<s> McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
<s> Arrested on an assault charge five times...
<s> Time out!
<s> What's the horse pill for, honey?
<s> Are you a doctor?
<s> Yeah, what's up?
<s> 'Kay...
<s> Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
<s> To help you relax... please...
<s> Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
<s> Hi.
<s> Big man!
<s> Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
<s> After you, ma'am.
<s> Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
<s> You ol' fucker!
<s> Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
<s> What for?
<s> My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
<s> Exactly.
<s> Your great aunt.
<s> What's mezzaluna?
<s> That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
<s> Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
<s> Hi there...
<s> Amazing.
<s> Hm.
<s> You said whatever it was you would understand.
<s> He's safe.
<s> You didn't answer my question.
<s> Because I don't have the right name?!
<s> Right now?
<s> NO.
<s> You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
<s> What?
<s> No.  Course not.
<s> Are you asking me out?
<s> In that case... no...
<s> No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
<s> You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
<s> There is no us.
<s> I brought you that, too.
<s> Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
<s> Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
<s> Oh, hello.
<s> What?
<s> No.  He smokes.
<s> I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
<s> Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
<s> Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
<s> But it's July.
<s> Because you were afraid to fly.
<s> You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
<s> Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
<s> You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
<s> A rich, possibly fat, slob.
<s> You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
<s> Because I'm the one who's single.
<s> Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
<s> And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
<s> I meant about my idea.
<s> But how could he know?  He only just met me.
<s> Packing.
<s> I'll be back before you leave.
<s> Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
<s> I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
<s> Yes.  He is.
<s> When you could've found one in America.
<s> Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
<s> I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
<s> You miss me?...
<s> She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
<s> Talk louder. I can't hear you.
<s> The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
<s> Then don't.
<s> He probably gave 'em an argument.
<s> It's a living.
<s> Thicker than water.
<s> The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
<s> They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
<s> Don't say that!
<s> Terry... Terry... .
<s> None of your business.
<s> Everybody knew him. He got around.
<s> Man, you were a mess!
<s> I only live up there and across the roof.
<s> The things that go on.
<s> Oh she's a beauty.
<s> What a fruitcake you are!
<s> Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
<s> I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
<s> Why should I come hollering to you at all?
<s> Go ahead, wear it.
<s> There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
<s> Who says?
<s> How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
<s> It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
<s> I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
<s> Get out of my way.
<s> You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
<s> He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
<s> I'll find you a priest.
<s> Good luck.
<s> Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
<s> If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
<s> I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
<s> Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
<s> Yeah, really!
<s> Raise a hand to me and... .
<s> O.K., O.K., That's enough.
<s> Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
<s> Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
<s> Hit me again.
<s> First things first.
<s> Aw, Johnny... .
<s> You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
<s> Now just a minute, I
<s> Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
<s> I was only talkin' to her.
<s> I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
<s> Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
<s> I do not joke in my proposal.
<s> Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
<s> Okay.
<s> I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
<s> I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
<s> I'm afraid I'll faint.
<s> Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
<s> I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
<s> There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> A situation easily remedied.
<s> As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
<s> At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
<s> Ahh, there is yet time.
<s> I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
<s> Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
<s> You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
<s> Aaarrrgggaahh.
<s> Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
<s> And the one driving the other car?
<s> I know a Glenn.
<s> You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
<s> Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
<s> Yes.
<s> Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
<s> Why don't we talk about it later?
<s> There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
<s> Love is funny.
<s> Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
<s> Half for doing what?
<s> I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
<s> And what happened to Carl?
<s> Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
<s> There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
<s> The manager's door is metal.
<s> You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
<s> Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
<s> That's right.
<s> Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
<s> Let's go outside and talk.
<s> Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
<s> I thought everything.
<s> I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Bleeding on a country road.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Really.
<s> How do we do that?
<s> I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
<s> I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
<s> I can go to the bar.
<s> That's not what you were about to say.
<s> Yeah, but in a nice way.
<s> I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
<s> You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
<s> Oh, uh, right, thanks...
<s> No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
<s> How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
<s> Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
<s> Yeah.  That was the ninth.
<s> I remember you now.  Shit.
<s> No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
<s> You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
<s> Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
<s> Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
<s> Can I do what?
<s> Great.  We got one of 'em.
<s> Oh...
<s> How you know that?
<s> That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
<s> What're you doing at Glades?
<s> You used to like it.
<s> He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
<s> Likewise.
<s> Yeah, as soon as we got back.
<s> Well, I need that...
<s> Are they dead?
<s> No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
<s> He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
<s> He was that good?
<s> Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
<s> Yes Sir.
<s> You liked that?
<s> Where's that lizard?
<s> You guys are new?
<s> Well, you p-puked on his feet.
<s> Kill the bastards!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
<s> What facts are those?
<s> I was grieving too.
<s> How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
<s> Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
<s> I can't make it.
<s> Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
<s> We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
<s> We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
<s> He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
<s> Bombers.
<s> Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
<s> No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
<s> We're all going away.
<s> I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
<s> The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
<s> Have the planes made it to China?
<s> So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
<s> Crank her!
<s> Peggy Sue!
<s> I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
<s> Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
<s> Peggy Sue!
<s> Well, besides Charlie, of course.
<s> Yes. Let's stay in touch.
<s> On what?
<s> Just what you underlined.
<s> That loudmouthed little bitch~
<s> Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
<s> That's disgusting!
<s> I call this the staccato. 
<s> Why wait?
<s> Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
<s> Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
<s> Who?
<s> What am I going to do with you?
<s> Let's go down to the basement.
<s> I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
<s> What about Janet?
<s> Of course.
<s> Touchy, touchy!
<s> I can't do that.
<s> What?
<s> Just a little. I've had a tough day.
<s> That would be impossible.
<s> Mom, is there any coffee left?
<s> It's not Charlie. It's me.
<s> Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
<s> This morning was good.
<s> Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
<s> It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
<s> This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
<s> She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You have an incredible memory.
<s> I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
<s> I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
<s> Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
<s> I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
<s> What's inside?
<s> So you think time travel is possible? For people?
<s> This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
<s> I don't know.
<s> All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
<s> High tech. I like the sound of that.
<s> Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
<s> Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
<s> Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
<s> No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
<s> I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
<s> Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
<s> Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
<s> Pretty much so.
<s> Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> Just until he heals up?
<s> You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
<s> There's a better place...
<s> Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
<s> Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
<s> Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
<s> Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
<s> That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
<s> Ready for what, baby?
<s> Continue.
<s> Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
<s> One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
<s> We're friends of Beckett's.
<s> Correct.
<s> What have you prayed for?
<s> It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
<s> I suppose you could say that.
<s> I'm an excellent lawyer.
<s> It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
<s> In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
<s> Gay movies.
<s> I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
<s> Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
<s> Really?
<s> Thank you. No more questions.
<s> Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
<s> Get real.
<s> I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
<s> It satisfied me.
<s> I might.
<s> How many do you know?
<s> Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
<s> Any women on board?
<s> So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
<s> But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
<s> Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
<s> Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
<s> Look deeper.
<s> <u>Listen</u>.
<s> Let's drop back an' boot up.
<s> Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
<s> You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
<s> I would try for them.
<s> Can we switch?
<s> Big Evil?
<s> So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
<s> He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
<s> I never said I was.
<s> Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
<s> Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
<s> You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
<s> We're all on the same hajj now.
<s> And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
<s> I would rather we all stay--
<s> Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
<s> All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
<s> Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
<s> If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
<s> Well, you got the big gauge.
<s> Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
<s> Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
<s> We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
<s> I don't. And I'm not going to try.
<s> No, they won't -
<s> Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
<s> Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
<s> That way.
<s> Let's find them all.
<s> That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
<s> The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
<s> Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
<s> Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
<s> Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
<s> long pause) You know it.
<s> Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
<s> Okay.
<s> You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
<s> Zira doesn't want your female.
<s> Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
<s> Why special?
<s> By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
<s> Read it yourself.
<s> Okay.Up to the cave.
<s> Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
<s> Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
<s> God bless you.
<s> Of course. He saw you moving yours.
<s> He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
<s> Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
<s> You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
<s> ...don't feel like it either.
<s> Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
<s> I volunteered.
<s> What are the heads?
<s> Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
<s> Sounds like it.
<s> They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
<s> Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
<s> So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
<s> Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
<s> These two holes are yours...
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm supposing.
<s> I'm sure you have.
<s> How do you do?
<s> Why certainly, baby.
<s> Bank?
<s> I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
<s> No, please.
<s> You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
<s> Whatever you say.
<s> No thank you.
<s> I'd rather wait until it does matter.
<s> So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
<s> He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
<s> No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
<s> Do you have to leave the note?
<s> Killaine's wise to what?
<s> What your father did doesn't condemn you.
<s> And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
<s> Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
<s> I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
<s> I've never been to Florida.
<s> Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
<s> Because you think your in love with me?
<s> We know everything.
<s> Fascinated.
<s> I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
<s> A private joke.
<s> Hardly. Who's the girl?
<s> She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
<s> Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
<s> Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
<s> How would you know, Brandon?
<s> Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
<s> Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
<s> I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
<s> Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
<s> The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
<s> One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
<s> I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
<s> So?
<s> Did we ever really think it was suicide?
<s> And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
<s> A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
<s> I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
<s> Warm water, no doubt.
<s> I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
<s> I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
<s> Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
<s> I do.
<s> With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
<s> Who's the girl?
<s> As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
<s> She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
<s> I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
<s> How about your new friend?
<s> A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
<s> Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
<s> Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
<s> To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
<s> Thanks.
<s> We'll see you next week, and if--
<s> Well, we were just...
<s> That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
<s> It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
<s> I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
<s> Freshman and sophomores...
<s> No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
<s> I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
<s> I think it went on rather too long.
<s> How nice.
<s> I have to be up early. 
<s> No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
<s> To the airlift.
<s> The Argies.
<s> Let me see.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
<s> Yes, finally.
<s> Hello.
<s> Have you come to talk about me?
<s> Suez.  1956.
<s> All right.
<s> Take a look at these.
<s> Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
<s> No, thanks Dad.
<s> She said that?
<s> Now listen...
<s> In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
<s> Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
<s> I won't.  Goodnight.
<s> Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
<s> The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
<s> Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
<s> What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
<s> I'm not FBI anymore.
<s> Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
<s> It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
<s> Thanks, buddy.
<s> Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
<s> Did he rob it?
<s> Catch of the day.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
<s> Something... in the trees...
<s> No way, old buddy.
<s> We're not going.
<s> What, Sergeant?
<s> We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
<s> We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
<s> There's something else, Major...
<s> Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
<s> Philip!  We'll need shoes!
<s> But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
<s> To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
<s> Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
<s> What motel you staying at?
<s> Why?
<s> You mean they don't have hookers.
<s> Diet coke.
<s> Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
<s> You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
<s> Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
<s> He's good at what he does.
<s> Shall we mingle?
<s> Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
<s> Vivian...
<s> I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
<s> Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
<s> It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
<s> When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
<s> What do you mean?
<s> It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
<s> Yes...
<s> Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
<s> So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
<s> Yes.
<s> Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
<s> Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
<s> No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
<s> Of rent I do not bullshit.
<s> I leave extras, miss.
<s> You're a guest here?
<s> And who is that?
<s> Vivian.
<s> Will I like it?
<s> Steak spoon! 
<s> Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
<s> You're not accompanying him to New York?
<s> Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
<s> Yes.  Something... conservative.
<s> I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
<s> 'Scume me.
<s> You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
<s> I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
<s> With pride. What can I do for you?
<s> You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
<s> Of course you will.
<s> Hear this now: I will come for you.
<s> Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
<s> Did you say, "I do"?
<s> Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
<s> Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
<s> Who's Guilder?
<s> Veer left. Left. Left!
<s> I thought I was going faster.
<s> Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
<s> -- what? --
<s> Everybody ... MOVE!!
<s> The body?
<s> We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
<s> Right, right, sorry.
<s> What?
<s> All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
<s> You want me to read this or not?
<s> Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
<s> Of course.
<s> Not yet.
<s> I thought he was with you.
<s> Stop saying that!
<s> Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
<s> No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
<s> Nothing comes to mind.
<s> I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
<s> I smell nothing.
<s> Hmm.
<s> Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
<s> I will. And I choose --
<s> I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
<s> Don't say another word, Valerie.
<s> Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
<s> Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
<s> "I want to croon,
<s> I'll wait in the hall ...
<s> Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
<s> Do the books!  Do the books!
<s> Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
<s> I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
<s> It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
<s> What you were saying.  Keep talking.
<s> You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
<s> I already have.  Come on.
<s> Coney Island??
<s> Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
<s> To failure!
<s> All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
<s> I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
<s> Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
<s> Got dag pa dig.
<s> Nice girl.
<s> I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
<s> Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
<s> Wagner...
<s> "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
<s> Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
<s> No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
<s> What?
<s> Or arrived with her.
<s> She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
<s> Cash or check? For the cabin...
<s> If she paid you well?
<s> She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
<s> Can I trade in my car and take another?
<s> Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
<s> Of course not. Please.
<s> Five hundred.
<s> Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
<s> How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
<s> A lot?
<s> And the police haven't been able to...
<s> Like what?
<s> Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
<s> I want to know if my sister is here.
<s> Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
<s> All right! Then call! At least, call!
<s> Watch your tenses.
<s> How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
<s> What makes you sound so certain?
<s> Hospital clean.
<s> Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
<s> This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
<s> I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
<s> I haven't even been married once yet!
<s> I'll lick the stamps.
<s> I'm thinking of it.
<s> Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
<s> What are you running away from?
<s> Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
<s> Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
<s> Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
<s> No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
<s> Maybe you saw Mary!
<s> He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
<s> Haven't any.
<s> This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
<s> Leave me alone!
<s> From what?
<s> I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
<s> Indeed, he has often told me.
<s> Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
<s> You found Buckley?
<s> Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
<s> Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
<s> I'm going to call the police.
<s> How? What can I do?
<s> Yes!
<s> Yes, the child ...
<s> Yes.
<s> Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
<s> No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
<s> I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
<s> In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
<s> Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
<s> No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
<s> Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
<s> I'd call it stupid at any time.
<s> It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
<s> The body of Joan Gale!
<s> I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
<s> Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
<s> What do you think I am?
<s> Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
<s> Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
<s> Almost certain.
<s> What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
<s> What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
<s> Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
<s> Where were you going when you got in that cab?
<s> Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
<s> Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
<s> Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
<s> My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
<s> No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
<s> I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
<s> She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
<s> Good night, sir.
<s> Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
<s> Where to?
<s> That's the physicist's playground.
<s> It's an experiment.
<s> God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
<s> A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
<s> This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
<s> What is it, Rose?
<s> What'd you do, Rose?
<s> Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
<s> But Rose...
<s> Good night, Rose.
<s> I said I wouldn't.
<s> Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
<s> Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
<s> What was your mother like?
<s> Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
<s> Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
<s> Well, a little.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well, it's not very plain.
<s> Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
<s> They're discussing it.
<s> She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
<s> Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
<s> That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
<s> I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
<s> First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
<s> Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
<s> She will succeed.
<s> Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
<s> You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
<s> No reason at all, darlin'.
<s> Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
<s> You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
<s> Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
<s> Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
<s> What did you forget?
<s> Over... my... dead... body!
<s> Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
<s> If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
<s> Well, it's Billy.
<s> He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
<s> Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
<s> What's the use, there ain't none.
<s> Galley proof.
<s> That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
<s> She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
<s> Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
<s> Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
<s> Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
<s> Gonorrhea?
<s> No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
<s> Illusions, Madam?
<s> Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
<s> No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yeah, it's kinda nice.
<s> I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
<s> I was offered that job as a waitress.
<s> Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
<s> What do you want me to do about it?
<s> I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Clench your teeth.
<s> I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
<s> Name one.
<s> Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
<s> Same day as before.  I think.
<s> You don't smoke.
<s> What... what kinda thing is that to say?
<s> Bullshit.
<s> No, but it should.
<s> Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
<s> Nope.
<s> There'll be other chances.
<s> Where have you been?
<s> Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
<s> It's our job.
<s> Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
<s> Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
<s> Absolutely.
<s> No you're not.
<s> No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
<s> You think this is so easy?
<s> Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
<s> Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
<s> All for one...
<s> Just got here.
<s> So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
<s> Know what I love about dynamite?
<s> It's one of a kind.
<s> Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
<s> I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
<s> Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
<s> That's all any of us can see.
<s> Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
<s> Good, I hate long waits.
<s> I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
<s> Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
<s> Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
<s> Your Royal Highness.
<s> I see them. Wait, Leia!
<s> Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
<s> Just...images, really. Feelings.
<s> She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
<s> But, why must you confront him?
<s> I know, father.
<s> I will not fight you.
<s> On my mother's grave.
<s> Janet.
<s> I've got something to say.
<s> Dammit, Janet.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
<s> So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
<s> Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
<s> Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
<s> Free to try and find a game
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
<s> Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
<s> ...I'm sorry.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Ohh!
<s> ...I suppose.
<s> ...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
<s> 'Cause you can't sing or dance?
<s> I sold them to you.
<s> It's not that --
<s> No, I don't belong here.
<s> I should leave.
<s> Don't tease me.
<s> Sharp -- Real nice.
<s> ...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
<s> ...Yes --
<s> Yeah...
<s> I gotta go out for a while.
<s> Apollo?
<s> Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
<s> I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
<s> What?!
<s> Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
<s> ...Thanks.
<s> Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
<s> ...It's very American.
<s> Fouls.
<s> ...This man.
<s> He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
<s> She ain't retarded, she's shy.
<s> Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
<s> Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
<s> That's it.
<s> I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
<s> He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
<s> Black market?
<s> No -- Just me.
<s> I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
<s> Why?
<s> I said, how ya feelin'?
<s> I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
<s> Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
<s> Yeah, Kayo.
<s> Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
<s> Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
<s> I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
<s> Real good.
<s> Ain't had time to check 'em.
<s> What?
<s> My sister's a friggin' loser.
<s> ...Adrian ain't sharp.
<s> Maybe ya should see a doctor.
<s> Maybe another job is the best thing.
<s> Maybe ya better forget it.
<s> ...Tight.
<s> Gazzo's a good man.
<s> Keep this job, ya eat better.
<s> Sure I like her.
<s> I dunno -- she fills gaps.
<s> Whatta these guys want?
<s> Feel? I dunno... Happy.
<s> You serve martinis, doncha?
<s> Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
<s> You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
<s> I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
<s> Thanks for the vote of confidence.
<s> What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
<s> So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
<s> So you're Cloverleaf?
<s> What the hell's a freeway?
<s> That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
<s> Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
<s> It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
<s> If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
<s> That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
<s> Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
<s> Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
<s> Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
<s> Have you got the will?
<s> No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
<s> Divorce?  Never!
<s> Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
<s> And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
<s> A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
<s> We can't do anything till it's dark.
<s> Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
<s> No, it's not.
<s> I do bite my thumb, sir!
<s> [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
<s> Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
<s> Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
<s> Am I like Such a fellow?
<s> Good-morrow, cousin.
<s> It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
<s> Of love?
<s> A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
<s> Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
<s> She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
<s> Young Romeo is it?
<s> He shall be endured
<s> Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
<s> Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
<s> Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
<s> And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<s> She'll not come down tonight.
<s> Madam, in happy time what day is that?
<s> Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
<s> Romeo, I drink to thee.
<s> I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
<s> If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
<s> I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
<s> Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
<s> A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
<s> In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
<s> Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
<s> Right.
<s> What wouldst thou have with me?
<s> Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
<s> Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
<s> To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
<s> I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
<s> And who are you?
<s> Now there's the Deirdre I know.
<s> That's him.
<s> You lose them!
<s> I didn't say I was.
<s> Not so fast.  Who's that?
<s> Enough!
<s> You'll die if you leave here.
<s> Now that is an interesting proposition.
<s> I don't have it with me...
<s> There is one other thing...
<s> Is that right?
<s> Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
<s> What makes you think we're here to meet you?
<s> No thanks.
<s> I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
<s> Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
<s> Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
<s> This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
<s> You see the bullet?
<s> Do what?
<s> Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
<s> I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
<s> You think?
<s> Right now?
<s> Business keeps you on the road?
<s> If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
<s> What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
<s> Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
<s> I'll work on it...
<s> You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
<s> Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
<s> Seamus Reilly.
<s> I might know where you could get a copy.
<s> I can't get enough of it.
<s> Sure thing, and --
<s> The horniest dog in Nevada.
<s> Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
<s> He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
<s> You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
<s> We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
<s> Okay then.  I'll do it.
<s> Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
<s> All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
<s> If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
<s> I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
<s> It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
<s> That's right.
<s> No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
<s> Just take it in stride.
<s> Shut up, Jesse.
<s> OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
<s> Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
<s> Has he?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Are you sure you're OK?
<s> He's not, he's...
<s> Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
<s> Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
<s> I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
<s> I love you Sally.
<s> I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
<s> What did he buy?
<s> We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
<s> Excellent. I'll go down with you.
<s> Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
<s> Dwayne.
<s> Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
<s> Lingerie...
<s> Uh...C?
<s> Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
<s> A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
<s> Right behind you.
<s> So I want the money and I want it now.
<s> We're gonna talk.
<s> I was in the neighborhood.
<s> Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
<s> Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
<s> I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
<s> Those are five hundred dollar chips.
<s> I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
<s> I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
<s> Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
<s> This is your ship?
<s> Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
<s> I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
<s> We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
<s> What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
<s> Lee, you okay?
<s> C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
<s> That's right.
<s> That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
<s> Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
<s> I knew you were lying.
<s> Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> You said --
<s> Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
<s> Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
<s> She never even looked at you.
<s> I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
<s> I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
<s> Fine by me.
<s> No kung pao chicken.  Never.
<s> Who's Benjamin?
<s> Dancing?
<s> Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
<s> It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
<s> The Plaza Hotel?
<s> Amen to that, brother.
<s> I still have my lunch money from third grade.
<s> I'll take him.
<s> They asked for the best street man I had.
<s> You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
<s> Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
<s> Witnesses.
<s> He was trying to kill me, not you.
<s> It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
<s> Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
<s> Stooly.
<s> Thank you. I learn a great deal.
<s> I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
<s> Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
<s> The Feds?!
<s> Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
<s> This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
<s> What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
<s> At this point we don't have much.
<s> Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
<s> That's what you were supposed to be!
<s> And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Do it!
<s> Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
<s> I still have work to do here.
<s> Let me take you back inside, okay?
<s> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
<s> What did he ask?
<s> Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
<s> Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
<s> I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
<s> No.  No, you didn't.
<s> Where do you think she's going?
<s> Look, he's in pretty good shape.
<s> The real story on Miss Carpenter.
<s> It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
<s> "Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
<s> But I'll get my normal fee, right?
<s> Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
<s> You're coming here?
<s> Then come for dinner.
<s> Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
<s> Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
<s> Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
<s> Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
<s> Cindy the manicurist.
<s> So?  Is that what you said to her?
<s> Agreed.
<s> No.  You take it.
<s> Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> Can you fix it?
<s> Yes.
<s> That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
<s> No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
<s> I'd rather not.
<s> I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
<s> Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
<s> He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
<s> Why?
<s> No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
<s> Quick.  Very quick.
<s> You don't love me, is that it?
<s> What am I going to do with a microwave?
<s> He's got a houseboat.
<s> They're going to love you.
<s> He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
<s> Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
<s> Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
<s> Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
<s> Nothing's with me.
<s> "Dear Sleepless and Son..."
<s> "I want to meet you..."
<s> Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
<s> And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
<s> That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
<s> It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
<s> We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
<s> Okay.
<s> I know.
<s> I want my money.
<s> Walter and I are engaged!
<s> Destiny takes a hand.
<s> Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
<s> Magic.
<s> Grace heard it.
<s> It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
<s> She died.
<s> How about rapacious and love- starved?
<s> Right, right.
<s> Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
<s> H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
<s> You think so?
<s> Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
<s> Window.
<s> It plays in 50 states.
<s> Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
<s> -- a slice of pizza --
<s> Is that what she used to sing?
<s> I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
<s> I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
<s> Now I'm late.  Bye.
<s> Jonah, I'm leaving --
<s> There she is.
<s> I was thirsty.
<s> The water tastes better in the kitchen.
<s> Was Mom an adjustment?
<s> Who is Annie?
<s> It might be in the kitchen.
<s> Shut up.
<s> I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
<s> Well...
<s> You could have called me --
<s> I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
<s> Whose side are you on anyway?
<s> You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
<s> It never ends.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The woman question?
<s> What do you mean -- sex equality?
<s> You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
<s> So much the better.
<s> You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
<s> They are singing for me.
<s> No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
<s> It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
<s> Never... never... never!
<s> I did forget. Lus told me.
<s> It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
<s> Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
<s> They say I am no good to you.
<s> No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
<s> Hunting.
<s> Like what?
<s> Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
<s> Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
<s> It's Mama's Saint's Day.
<s> She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
<s> Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
<s> You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
<s> The spiders.
<s> Not even a guess?
<s> You like that?
<s> I'll see you tonight.
<s> Colette ...
<s> Why not?
<s> Never heard of him.
<s> It's me.
<s> Please open the door, Danny.
<s> You can still work.
<s> I just can't. Okay?
<s> You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
<s> I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
<s> It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
<s> Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
<s> Sorry.
<s> Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
<s> No  You think she's a tweaker?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Crank or glass?
<s> Secret recipe.
<s> If you say so.
<s> Pull your pants down.
<s> What?!
<s> No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
<s> I'll keep that in mind.
<s> You go, boy.
<s> God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
<s> I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
<s> This chink have a name?
<s> After that ass-whipping you gave me?
<s> Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
<s> What's he holding?
<s> What?!
<s> I still don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
<s> They have. But they never found a lab.
<s> Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
<s> And you've got wiener breath.
<s> Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
<s> I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
<s> Here it comes, poor Tom.
<s> Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
<s> The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
<s> Figured.
<s> Shit, that was no big deal.
<s> They got squirrels there, too, right?
<s> Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
<s> Like hell, you did.
<s> What deal?
<s> A half-track, anything.
<s> That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
<s> FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
<s> Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
<s> Did he see any sign of them?
<s> Same place we are.
<s> Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
<s> Simpson.
<s> What about Talbot?
<s> PUSH!
<s> Bits and pieces.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> There's always a bright side.
<s> Well, I, for one, like cheese.
<s> Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
<s> Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
<s> You have orders, too.
<s> Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
<s> Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
<s> Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
<s> Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
<s> Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
<s> ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
<s> Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
<s> Get lost.
<s> Twenty-four-five.
<s> That's right.
<s> Excellent.
<s> I hope you understand.
<s> How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
<s> Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
<s> Okay, I got it.
<s> If she wants me, she can come to me.
<s> Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
<s> Look at his face, he did the deed.
<s> 'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
<s> Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
<s> You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> I know that.
<s> Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
<s> Swear to god.
<s> Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
<s> Job?  Being a great date.
<s> Sixteen weeks is a long time.
<s> I just can't have any social life right now.
<s> Yeah.
<s> This is so noble.
<s> You're cold.
<s> Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
<s> We decided...
<s> Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
<s> No.
<s> Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
<s> Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
<s> No.
<s> Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
<s> How do you pay for one of those?
<s> Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
<s> You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
<s> You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
<s> Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
<s> Your car?
<s> No way.
<s> I'm Lloyd Dobler.
<s> A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
<s> Thanks a lot Lloyd.
<s> How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
<s> Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
<s> My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
<s> It's up to you.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
<s> These people, my people, I want my people.
<s> Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
<s> Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
<s> He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
<s> Yes.
<s> There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
<s> Christmas presents.
<s> You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
<s> Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
<s> The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
<s> Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
<s> What is it?
<s> Stop it...
<s> What if I said you?
<s> Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
<s> Please, Cotton, dont do this.
<s> Tons and tons.
<s> Youre all in this together?
<s> Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
<s> "And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
<s> I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
<s> Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
<s> Damned if I know. She ditched me.
<s> Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
<s> I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
<s> Tails.
<s> No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
<s> Can we turn the light on?
<s> He filmed his victims.
<s> No, wait here.
<s> That's not the way we play the game.
<s> You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
<s> Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
<s> Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
<s> But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
<s> It's not a good idea, Hallie.
<s> Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
<s> Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
<s> Thanks, Joel.
<s> Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
<s> But...
<s> Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
<s> Closer than you think.
<s> It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
<s> Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
<s> Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
<s> And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
<s> Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
<s> Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
<s> Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
<s> Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
<s> I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
<s> In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
<s> To me Hollywood is about death.
<s> Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
<s> What Rielly?
<s> He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
<s> And what made you think it was Sidney?
<s> I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
<s> Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
<s> Sid I can see you!
<s> Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
<s> Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
<s> Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
<s> What?
<s> Just Jennifer.  And you.
<s> Do you want us to come with you?
<s> Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
<s> No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
<s> I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
<s> Oh shit it's my cell!
<s> Need to get in that building?
<s> GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
<s> Who?
<s> I know! He killed Kincaid!
<s> Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
<s> Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
<s> What?  What movie?
<s> How do I know their voices are --
<s> I'll call you, when you're on your way.
<s> You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
<s> No one's saying you did.
<s> Piece of cake. She'll be there.
<s> I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
<s> It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
<s> Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
<s> She looked dead. Still does.
<s> I just wanted to see her, that's all.
<s> You sleep in THAT?
<s> Hey, hey, it's just me.
<s> When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
<s> Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
<s> Or even a good porno.
<s> What?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> To apologize.
<s> Wait, wait, don't hang up.
<s> You have to have a favorite.
<s> To talk.
<s> Sure...
<s> Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
<s> What?
<s> You never know when or where a story will break.
<s> I don't think you're so bad.
<s> Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
<s> ...yeah...
<s> We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
<s> And my Dad? Any word on him?
<s> Not yet.
<s> Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
<s> Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
<s> Have you contacted the bureau?
<s> You think he could still be in town?
<s> She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
<s> What is it? Where's Casey?
<s> Jesus! The camera-hurry!
<s> As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> It'll be out later this year.
<s> What's your favorite scary movie?
<s> Hello Sidney.
<s> Who are you?
<s> ...out at the airport...
<s> Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
<s> And what would be your motive?
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Yeah, okay... whatever.
<s> What happened?
<s> No way.
<s> Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
<s> I don't know...
<s> You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
<s> Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
<s> With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
<s> Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
<s> Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
<s> Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
<s> What am I? The beer wench?
<s> I'll see you.
<s> Turn around.  Hands on your head!
<s> It's not too far away now.
<s> Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
<s> Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
<s> You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
<s> We would have gotten you eventually.
<s> Sit back.
<s> All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
<s> I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
<s> And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
<s> But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
<s> What?
<s> I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
<s> Tonight.
<s> I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
<s> Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
<s> Okay.  But, what?
<s> Bear with me.
<s> Just wait!
<s> No.
<s> Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
<s> I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
<s> Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
<s> No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
<s> This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
<s> That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
<s> You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
<s> How can you say that?  Especially after today?
<s> You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
<s> No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
<s> You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
<s> High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
<s> I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
<s> It's a hard place.
<s> You should look into private schools.
<s> Did the wife confess?
<s> How should I know?
<s> Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
<s> She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
<s> This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
<s> No sir...pleasure.
<s> Yes sir...
<s> You fit a lot of descriptions.
<s> I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
<s> Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
<s> Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
<s> Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
<s> Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
<s> Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
<s> Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
<s> Because she's my...my...
<s> All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
<s> What's that?
<s> What?
<s> Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
<s> She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
<s> You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
<s> No...not yet...
<s> Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
<s> Oh, damnit!
<s> Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
<s> What? What am I supposed to sense?
<s> We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
<s> ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
<s> I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
<s> I wouldn't have made it by myself.
<s> You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
<s> 1976.  What happened back then?
<s> I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
<s> I've killed my husband!
<s> I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
<s> The title won't do.
<s> The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
<s> A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
<s> Romeo
<s> Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
<s> Nothing comes.
<s> yet cannot love nor write it.
<s> Cut his nose off.
<s> It is all locked safe in here
<s> Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
<s> Who wrote that?
<s> You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
<s> What do we do now?
<s> I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
<s> "Is the day so young?"
<s> "Not having that which, having, makes them short."
<s> Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
<s> Verona again.
<s> Stand up straight, girl.
<s> Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
<s> So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
<s> Oh--I am him too!
<s> Can you love a player?
<s> Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
<s> Well perhaps better than my first. 
<s> I must. Look-- how pale the window.
<s> Mr. Henslowe?
<s> It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
<s> What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
<s> You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
<s> Virginia?!
<s> The Queen has consented?
<s> It is to be expected on a Sunday.
<s> Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
<s> He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
<s> Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
<s> I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
<s> Just serve.
<s> Can I show you something?
<s> Think about it.
<s> All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
<s> Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
<s> We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
<s> You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
<s> I just thought we should discuss it.
<s> Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
<s> I don't know.
<s> There was a break-in.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You're not eating.
<s> It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Where do you think you'll go?
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
<s> -- which is a hack.
<s> You were magnificent.
<s> Are you all right?
<s> Don't you?
<s> Your painful groin?
<s> Where he can't get it?
<s> Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
<s> It's the only way.
<s> We were just sorting things out.
<s> Burglary?
<s> No, three. Who said there were four?
<s> You're sure of that.
<s> Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It was on the television.
<s> Eh --
<s> It's a breeze.
<s> It's an improvement.
<s> Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
<s> I mean, that's what it's like.
<s> Is it real?
<s> Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
<s> I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
<s> Lester, don't you think that uhh --
<s> -- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
<s> I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
<s> Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<s> I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
<s> But you don't know what happened.
<s> Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
<s> No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
<s> No.
<s> I guess so.
<s> I do her hair, yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Gee, this is great.
<s> I never get my hair done.
<s> I am not!
<s> Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
<s> It's hot in here.
<s> Do you? You still see him?
<s> What about it?
<s> Sweetheart, you're drunk.
<s> We're friends.
<s> Nothing.
<s> -- well you better go after her.
<s> Lester's on his way.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> What for?
<s> What?
<s> She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
<s> Wanda...
<s> Wash her.
<s> Hey, stop by the shop.
<s> You said somebody... who?
<s> Of course I like children.
<s> Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
<s> I'll call you.
<s> Where's your car?
<s> Look at the way I live.
<s> -- she's a very compulsive girl.
<s> What is.
<s> Oh, Christ.
<s> -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
<s> Jesus.
<s> -- A wash and set.
<s> Well, yeah.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh yeah? I mean I know.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> I know what you mean.
<s> What about, tonight?
<s> It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
<s> Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
<s> But...
<s> What?
<s> Wasn't sure it was you.
<s> George is going to open a shop.
<s> George is great but I know what you mean.
<s> Jackie --
<s> Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
<s> Honey?
<s> Well, there was this one time --
<s> -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
<s> That's right.
<s> Is he an enemy?
<s> My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
<s> -- never mind.
<s> He's a hairdresser.
<s> I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Dad?
<s> No, Dad.
<s> I'm not supposed to.
<s> Okay, Mom.
<s> Okay...oh!
<s> Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Danny... what's the matter, hon?
<s> Yes.
<s> Where does he go?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
<s> Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
<s> I'm a Wendy.
<s> I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
<s> Good.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
<s> Yeah... that's all it is.
<s> It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
<s> Which room was it?
<s> Oh, well - come on in Jack.
<s> I'm intrigued.
<s> No, my son's discovered the games room.
<s> Fine.
<s> Sure, Uncle Al.
<s> Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
<s> Will you?
<s> All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
<s> No.
<s> She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
<s> I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
<s> I told you!
<s> And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
<s> The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
<s> Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
<s> Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
<s> -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
<s> What about crack?  You a user?
<s> BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
<s> Were you tempted?
<s> SING!
<s> Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
<s> And you listen to that?
<s> Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
<s> What?
<s> You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
<s> Good evening, Vincent.
<s> Joey -- do it.
<s> Yes, Betty?
<s> Oh-huh.
<s> Yes, Betty?
<s> But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
<s> Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
<s> Chops?
<s> Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
<s> A novice.
<s> Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Experience!
<s> Give me a C.  A C!
<s> Very well.
<s> What? 
<s> As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
<s> A what?
<s> No food?
<s> Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
<s> Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
<s> No.  No.
<s> And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
<s> Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
<s> Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
<s> I'm a Christian.
<s> Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
<s> You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
<s> Okay -- no limo.
<s> But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
<s> Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
<s> Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
<s> You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
<s> Hail, Mary.
<s> Really.
<s> A hiding place.
<s> I'm telling you!
<s> It's a bluff, Vince.
<s> So, take it off.
<s> Which one!
<s> No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
<s> That's what I figured, too.
<s> For like, twelve zillion eternities?
<s> Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
<s> Really...
<s> However, we can also pray for other things.
<s> But how do we get there?
<s> She said they were from her old convent.
<s> We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
<s> I know. 
<s> I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
<s> You will stay at her side?
<s> No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
<s> They need guidance.
<s> I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
<s> He drowned.  Anyone could see.
<s> Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
<s> Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
<s> The militia?
<s> My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
<s> Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
<s> I did not ask you to, did I?
<s> Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
<s> "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
<s> To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
<s> In test... what?
<s> Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
<s> If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
<s> Just... keep where you are.
<s> It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
<s> Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
<s> I can show exactly.
<s> She did not do it... please listen...
<s> How are you, Bill?
<s> I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
<s> What do you like to eat here?
<s> How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
<s> How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
<s> I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
<s> Don't say nothin' about that boy.
<s> I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
<s> Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
<s> See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
<s> What?
<s> Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
<s> You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> No sir.
<s> Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
<s> I know Albert. We're friends.
<s> That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
<s> It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
<s> They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
<s> You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
<s> He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
<s> That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
<s> Hit was right thoughty of her.
<s> Pull on your works. Your privates.
<s> Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
<s> My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
<s> A little ol' boy.
<s> Yes sir, I reckon it does.
<s> Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
<s> Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
<s> He ain't ever okay to me.
<s> Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
<s> I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I ain't got no boy.
<s> I want to come back and stay here.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
<s> All right then.
<s> Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
<s> Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
<s> That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
<s> Why won't he talk to women?
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> American literature. What else?
<s> What's that, Sol?
<s> I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
<s> Yeah, I did.
<s> They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
<s> Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
<s> Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
<s> He's crazy.
<s> I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
<s> And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
<s> Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
<s> And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
<s> Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
<s> And what's that supposed to mean?
<s> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
<s> She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
<s> Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
<s> For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
<s> Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
<s> The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
<s> You mean Rashid?
<s> That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
<s> Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
<s> Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
<s> And?
<s> Those are pretty hostile words.
<s> You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
<s> Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
<s> I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
<s> Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
<s> Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
<s> You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
<s> Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
<s> Eight-thirty?
<s> How long have you been here?
<s> Take good care of yourself, okay?
<s> You don't really want to know.
<s> I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
<s> I just did.
<s> Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
<s> No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
<s> He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
<s> Good. I'm glad that's settled!
<s> It's all right. I really do know them.
<s> Now ask him who his mother was.
<s> Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
<s> Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
<s> That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
<s> You done your math right.
<s> So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
<s> I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
<s> There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
<s> But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
<s> Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
<s> Carl Heine came.
<s> Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
<s> I have told the truth.
<s> You're right.  I better use two.
<s> You're wondering why I held it.
<s> Naw, I had that around for a while.
<s> I should show them an American?
<s> That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
<s> Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
<s> He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
<s> That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
<s> I suppose you want a tip?
<s> Get lost, will you?
<s> Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
<s> A what?
<s> What did he say?
<s> Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
<s> What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
<s> Quiet - I'm thinking.
<s> We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
<s> I never did like the name Geraldine.
<s> Watch it, Daphne!
<s> Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
<s> Now you've done it!
<s> You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
<s> Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
<s> And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
<s> Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
<s> Have I got things to tell you!
<s> His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
<s> Daphne got a proposal tonight.
<s> Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
<s> There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
<s> Get me Room 414.
<s> Yeah - lets shove off.
<s> I'm Sugar Cane.
<s> No.  It's nice and cozy.
<s> You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
<s> When?
<s> Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
<s> Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
<s> I guess she's not in here.
<s> Well, I'll come back later.
<s> I met one of them.
<s> Yes.  For a whole year.
<s> What's the big idea?
<s> Personally, I'm Type O.
<s> You don't say.
<s> You're not sure?
<s> I'm not surprised.
<s> Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
<s> Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
<s> You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
<s> And I can never have children.
<s> Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
<s> That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
<s> We won't breathe a word.
<s> Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
<s> The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
<s> Why?
<s> William Morris!
<s> No - funerals.
<s> There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
<s> No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
<s> I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
<s> Every time!
<s> I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
<s> Glasses?
<s> Well, now that you've mentioned it -
<s> I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
<s> I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
<s> Would you mind terribly?
<s> Just my feminine intuition.
<s> Who are you?
<s> Not very likely.
<s> Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
<s> Could be.  Do you play the market?
<s> Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
<s> Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
<s> Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
<s> If it's at all possible -
<s> Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
<s> Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
<s> It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
<s> I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
<s> Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
<s> Nothing at all?
<s> Talk about sad.
<s> Mineral baths - now really!
<s> Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
<s> Me?
<s> I knew you would.
<s> What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
<s> That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
<s> That's because I've been on the wagon.
<s> I cut myself shaving.
<s> I already told you.
<s> Spats Colombo.
<s> What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
<s> Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
<s> What? Why? What do you mean?
<s> So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
<s> Jeffrey told her last night.
<s> Oh, dont be that way.
<s> So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
<s> She did?
<s> Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
<s> I had to say something to get you here.
<s> Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
<s> Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
<s> I slept with your sister.
<s> You have feet?
<s> Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
<s> You stand on your tiptoes.
<s> A weekend?
<s> I think thats disgusting.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Show me.
<s> Desperation?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
<s> You have more than one gynecologist?
<s> I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
<s> You knew?
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
<s> It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
<s> Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
<s> Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
<s> My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
<s> Nothin'...
<s> She was dirty and wet...
<s> :His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
<s> :His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
<s> I did look, Charlie, but I--
<s> Here, put my jacket over you.
<s> He'll show up one day.
<s> Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
<s> Mornin', Daddy...
<s> And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
<s> Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
<s> Sunday...
<s> Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
<s> My father taught me...
<s> David!
<s> Sausage and hambones!
<s> Thank you, Josie Mae.
<s> Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
<s> Yes mam...
<s> Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
<s> Children, come here...
<s> No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
<s> He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
<s> I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
<s> Good night...
<s> Did you find your father?
<s> But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
<s> It's the heat.
<s> He can't get up, Mama!
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
<s> If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
<s> Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
<s> Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
<s> To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
<s> I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
<s> About what?
<s> Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
<s> You bet your fucking ass it was!
<s> Okay.    Not.
<s> Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
<s> Yes, hon?
<s> I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
<s> Eric, that is not appropriate.
<s> God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
<s> Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
<s> Eric?
<s> Baba mama!
<s> Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
<s> Mph rm.
<s> Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
<s> Uhh... I don't know.
<s> Kay.
<s> I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
<s> YOU BASTARD!!
<s> I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
<s> I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
<s> All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
<s> Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
<s> Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
<s> Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
<s> <b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
<s> Cheers, Terrance!
<s> You would know, dummy.
<s> I know, Terrance. I know.
<s> You did? Just now?
<s> I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
<s> Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
<s> I know.
<s> Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
<s> THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
<s> That's nice, Stan.
<s> What's the matter, Wendy?
<s> Cool!
<s> Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
<s> And ze rope?
<s> Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
<s> It can't be.
<s> Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
<s> I'm sure I will.
<s> Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
<s> Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
<s> Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
<s> I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
<s> It's steady, good benefits.
<s> Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
<s> Taylor, you surprise me.
<s> Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
<s> That's me.
<s> Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
<s> Let's get something straight, Chappy!
<s> Just don't move around too much.
<s> Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
<s> Close every door behind you!
<s> So we did.
<s> Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
<s> Sure.
<s> A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
<s> What?  What are you talking about?
<s> Try not to think about it.
<s> That is one of my priorities.
<s> Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
<s> I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
<s> The engines!
<s> My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
<s> No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
<s> You afraid we're gonna steal it?
<s> No kiddin'.
<s> Wait! That's an aria!
<s> Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
<s> Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
<s> Theo's bowled on the tour.
<s> Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
<s> It's mine.
<s> The small ball.
<s> Don't say that about my mom!
<s> That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
<s> I never saw you.
<s> I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
<s> You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
<s> I gotta go. Love ya mom.
<s> Buzz Fazeli.
<s> Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
<s> I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
<s> Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
<s> Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
<s> How Mr. Kastle?
<s> I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
<s> Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
<s> Bowling "Center"!
<s> I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
<s> Coming right up.
<s> I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
<s> It's a vicious cycle.
<s> No, not at all.
<s> I'd rather you didn't.
<s> Really? I kinda like it.
<s> Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
<s> Why not?
<s> I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
<s> At least I'll die smiling.
<s> SSHHEEIILLAAA!
<s> What about plan C?
<s> Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
<s> I can't...
<s> Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
<s> Two and a half days?
<s> Yeah.  I heard you.
<s> Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
<s> What was that?
<s> Forty yards.
<s> The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
<s> From what?  What's with all the security?
<s> As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
<s> Geologists?
<s> What's wrong with oxygen?
<s> The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
<s> If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
<s> If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
<s> Ted seems to have some ideas.
<s> The what?
<s> It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
<s> How do you mean, strange?
<s> The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
<s> Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
<s> Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
<s> What is it?
<s> What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
<s> Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
<s> What?  No, I know they're civilians...
<s> Sir, about leaving --
<s> What was Edmunds doing outside?
<s> Wait -- down where?
<s> Yeah.  Drowning.
<s> No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
<s> The library.
<s> You did, didn't you?
<s> Beth --
<s> It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
<s> In case you die, too?
<s> You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
<s> You fixed this suit?  Beth?
<s> What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
<s> He what?
<s> Fixing it.
<s> I'll just boost the doses.
<s> What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
<s> Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
<s> You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
<s> How's Harry?
<s> Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
<s> And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
<s> It's either this... or I kill you.
<s> Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
<s> It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
<s> I --
<s> I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
<s> It's an American spacecraft.
<s> In time for what?
<s> Just in time for what?
<s> Fine.  I'm fine.
<s> I'm not being defensive.
<s> To what?
<s> But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
<s> On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
<s> You mean, you think I'm cracking?
<s> What noise?
<s> But why would she -- ?
<s> Wisconsin?
<s> Hold on.
<s> I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
<s> Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
<s> Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
<s> Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
<s> Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
<s> It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
<s> They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
<s> What was that, sir?
<s> Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
<s> Really?
<s> Please, Ted.
<s> Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
<s> I'm beginning not to like you.
<s> This isn't a game, you know.
<s> But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
<s> But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
<s> My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
<s> He can't find Organa Major.
<s> Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
<s> Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
<s> But there was a lot of firing earlier...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Send one squad up.
<s> Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
<s> What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
<s> Did it occur to you they might find us?
<s> We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
<s> You don't believe in the Force?
<s> All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
<s> Why didn't you say so before.
<s> Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
<s> But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
<s> Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
<s> Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
<s> I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
<s> What an honor...
<s> Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
<s> Death to all bugs !
<s> Sir... I guess I do, sir.
<s> Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
<s> You got it bad.
<s> If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
<s> Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
<s> Don't you have to finish the game ?
<s> Hey, check it.
<s> Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
<s> Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
<s> You're upset, that's alright.
<s> Who ?
<s> Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
<s> Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
<s> I don't want everyone to see.
<s> How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
<s> Who cares ?
<s> My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
<s> Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
<s> I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
<s> What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
<s> Should I be ?
<s> How are you, Carl ?
<s> See you on the bounce !
<s> Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
<s> You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
<s> Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
<s> How come we never got together ?
<s> Sure.
<s> Guess you gotta go.
<s> You saying you didn't ?
<s> Nah, I don't do that anymore...
<s> What ?
<s> Teenagers !
<s> Looks like rain.
<s> It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
<s> Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
<s> AAAAAAAAAAA !
<s> Uh, no.
<s> You can never be sure.
<s> Move out.
<s> Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
<s> Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> V'ger is that which programmed me.
<s> Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
<s> That is logical. You may procede.
<s> Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
<s> Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
<s> Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
<s> Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
<s> Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
<s> How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
<s> Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
<s> I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
<s> Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
<s> Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
<s> This served the purpose.
<s> Decker....!
<s> No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
<s> Twelve seconds...!
<s> Impact in fifteen seconds...
<s> Opinion, Mister. Spock?
<s> Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
<s> Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
<s> Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
<s> Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
<s> I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
<s> I am seeking answers, Captain.
<s> And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
<s> 'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
<s> Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
<s> Helm ready, sir.
<s> <U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
<s> I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
<s> Sure plan to.
<s> He'll eat potroast and like it.
<s> I need a typewritter.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's about a man who gets a second chance.
<s> No, of course, you want to get out of town.
<s> Yes...
<s> Goodbye.
<s> ...I always thought so...
<s> Mmm.
<s> What are you doing?  I love your script.
<s> You'd know better'n me.
<s> That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
<s> Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
<s> ...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
<s> Cast stood me up.
<s> You have to sign for it.
<s> One moment.
<s> You going to ask me in?
<s> You believe that?
<s> Go you Huskies!
<s> It used to be the Old Mill.
<s> They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
<s> Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
<s> What?
<s> People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
<s> ...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
<s> But that's what happened.
<s> Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
<s> We had a date.
<s> Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
<s> Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
<s> Courthouse back in town.
<s> And I need a drink.
<s> I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
<s> What'll I do for fun?
<s> I'm having dinner with W...
<s> 
<s> You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
<s> I...
<s> No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
<s> Mr. Barrenger.
<s> You have to what?
<s> The Mayor's outside.
<s> I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
<s> She's absolutely r...
<s> I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
<s> Who is that...?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes, yes, but...
<s> Is...Is the Movie!
<s> Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
<s> Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
<s> We, we have to give it.
<s> I...
<s> He treated me as if I were a child...
<s> I can't tell.
<s> Well.
<s> Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
<s> This young woman.
<s> You were in the car with Bob?
<s> He told you that...
<s> I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
<s> Later for you, pal.
<s> I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
<s> ...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
<s> Gut Yuntif.
<s> My wife just went into labor...
<s> A witness to what...?
<s> My wife is going to have a baby, and...
<s> You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
<s> You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
<s> The girl was in the car.
<s> Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
<s> I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
<s> They're coming Fedex...
<s> That's what I said.
<s> Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
<s> Find the money.
<s> She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
<s> Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
<s> And we're glad to have you here...
<s> George, that is so kind of you.
<s> It takes all kinds.
<s> Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
<s> He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
<s> Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
<s> I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
<s> I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
<s> She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
<s> I hate when you say that.
<s> Excellent point.
<s> Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
<s> Like a big sister.
<s> Mom?  What's wrong?
<s> And this is my room so get out!
<s> <u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
<s> He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
<s> IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
<s> Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
<s> &quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
<s> Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
<s> Yes...if you like big hair...
<s> Where are you, anyway?
<s> Yes.
<s> Rache can do that part.
<s> At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
<s> Let's take our best shot.
<s> I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
<s> I'm worried.
<s> Not to me.
<s> It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
<s> Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
<s> You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
<s> I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
<s> How the hell would you know?
<s> ...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
<s> You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
<s> Don't be too sure.
<s> Worked.  Like a charm.
<s> Neutral ground.  What's up?
<s> I lost him.  I was panicked.
<s> I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
<s> Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
<s> For what?
<s> Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
<s> ...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
<s> Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
<s> Maybe he's gay.
<s> What if he is?
<s> Yes.
<s> We had to work. My family was poor.
<s> Mi Jesusmi jesus
<s> Yes, Mikey?
<s> Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
<s> I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
<s> Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
<s> Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
<s> I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
<s> ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
<s> Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
<s> Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Say, 'Nigger.'
<s> Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
<s> Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
<s> I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
<s> Oh, I don't remember that...
<s> Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
<s> Maybe she has caller ID.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah?
<s> So where'd you get in?
<s> Oh.
<s> Y-yes--
<s> I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
<s> I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
<s> Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
<s> We're outta here--
<s> What do you think?
<s> Yeah?...
<s> Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
<s> Well Cooper...
<s> Even better.
<s> I said I don't want any, goddammit!
<s> She's still alive.
<s> We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> At his office in the Capitol.
<s> I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
<s> The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
<s> Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
<s> See!  See, I told you.
<s> Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
<s> Look, I didn't shoot him!
<s> Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
<s> Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
<s> Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
<s> What is your name, young lady?
<s> General Schmuck?
<s> But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
<s> I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
<s> Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
<s> A shooting war!
<s> But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
<s> Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
<s> Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
<s> Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
<s> To peace on earth.
<s> But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
<s> But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
<s> Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
<s> Peace on earth.
<s> Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
<s> And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
<s> That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
<s> Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
<s> How many planes did we lose?
<s> Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
<s> Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
<s> What?
<s> They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
<s> We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
<s> Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
<s> Forget it.
<s> Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
<s> All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
<s> Listen, give me a shot quick!
<s> Recall what mistake?
<s> Like hell it does.
<s> I don't get you, King.
<s> But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
<s> But I get a red light.
<s> Roger.
<s> I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
<s> But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
<s> Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
<s> Intense.
<s> Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
<s> Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Typical male.
<s> Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
<s> What's it about?
<s> Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
<s> You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
<s> Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
<s> Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
<s> That's the rock star thing.
<s> Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> No, I mean, no one.
<s> Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
<s> Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
<s> You know?
<s> Erica is in the van back there.
<s> Guess not.
<s> I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
<s> Jeff! Let's go!
<s> You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
<s> Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
<s> You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I didn't want to eat this much, man.
<s> Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
<s> What about me? I don't have a car.
<s> Really?
<s> What was your name again?
<s> Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
<s> Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, fuck 'em.
<s> What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
<s> Just go home, alright?
<s> He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
<s> That, that's Indian?
<s> Seven-twenty.
<s> Look, look, just get off my property.
<s> I hate that.
<s> So you can give me more shit?
<s> Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
<s> ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
<s> Sooze.
<s> Yes, you do.
<s> For a ride.
<s> Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
<s> Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
<s> Yeah, good.
<s> Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
<s> Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
<s> Camel jockey.
<s> It's stupid.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
<s> Hey.
<s> Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
<s> No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
<s> I can't believe you're still here.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Where do you get your ideas?
<s> Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
<s> About what?
<s> Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
<s> Don't do that, man, okay?
<s> Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
<s> Don't do that.
<s> Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
<s> At least I have a point of view, you know?
<s> Come on, Jeff.
<s> Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
<s> You know the fuck not.
<s> You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
<s> Look, it's really not my fault.
<s> Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
<s> Wayne Gretzky.
<s> Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
<s> No...I've been pregnant.
<s> No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
<s> You sure?
<s> If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
<s> Jack...
<s> Mmm-hmmm...
<s> What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
<s> I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
<s> He is the Great One...
<s> I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
<s> Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
<s> Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
<s> Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
<s> Kim-Lo?
<s> I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
<s> Oh yeah, you caught us...
<s> Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
<s> Now how the hell can I help you?
<s> Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
<s> I didn't mean to --
<s> The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
<s> I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
<s> Nothing for Ladd?
<s> I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
<s> That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
<s> Why, you sweet kid.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
<s> Life can be beautiful!
<s> Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
<s> What teacher?
<s> I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
<s> See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
<s> I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
<s> It must be my new shampoo.
<s> That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
<s> I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
<s> Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
<s> Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
<s> Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
<s> This is fascinating.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
<s> I've lost my car.
<s> Tails.  That's ridiculous.
<s> Who?
<s> I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
<s> What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
<s> This is the right day.
<s> I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
<s> Good.
<s> These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
<s> You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
<s> Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
<s> He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
<s> Dressed for what?
<s> I'm not here.
<s> I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
<s> She is upstairs.
<s> She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
<s> I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
<s> Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
<s> Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
<s> Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
<s> But where?
<s> Sorry, mistress.
<s> I've been saving it. For the right moment.
<s> No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
<s> And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
<s> It's for your own protection.
<s> I have to.
<s> Who didn't?
<s> Yes. It reminds me of home.
<s> Why not ?
<s> Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
<s> But why?
<s> And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
<s> What?
<s> She has hostages.
<s> I'll come back as soon as I can.
<s> I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
<s> I'll drink to that.
<s> You vicious--
<s> -- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
<s> Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
<s> You bet your ass.
<s> It's going to be a tree, I think.
<s> Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
<s> But what for?
<s> You sure?
<s> Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
<s> You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
<s> Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
<s> It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
<s> It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
<s> What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
<s> If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
<s> Zaltar!
<s> Clark.
<s> And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
<s> Too much mayonnaise?
<s> You thought that?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Old ties are hard to cut.
<s> Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<s> What!
<s> Who gets it, the company?
<s> Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
<s> Uh...
<s> Or socks.
<s> Decaffeinated too?
<s> Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
<s> Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
<s> Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
<s> Fair's fair.
<s> We've already got some.
<s> Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
<s> Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
<s> Watch out for them air pockets!
<s> I didn't have my camera with me.
<s> A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
<s> We've already met.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
<s> Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
<s> You've got to pick three more numbers.
<s> Today coffee----
<s> What's wrong?
<s> She'll be fine.
<s> Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
<s> Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
<s> Really?
<s> In July???
<s> Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
<s> What??
<s> Let's go to my place.
<s> Say you love me.
<s> I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
<s> You're not selfish at all.
<s> Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
<s> Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
<s> No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
<s> There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
<s> I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
<s> It's beautiful.
<s> Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
<s> Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
<s> Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
<s> Oh! That black box in our cell?
<s> Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
<s> The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
<s> Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
<s> Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
<s> Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
<s> Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
<s> And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
<s> What about here?
<s> Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
<s> Don't worry, I've got you.
<s> Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
<s> Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
<s> I'm not so sure you do.
<s> Like me?
<s> I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> Mr. White, come with me I want to see
<s> Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
<s> Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
<s> Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
<s> But why the hair?
<s> Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
<s> Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
<s> Thank you.
<s> One of them should've been you.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> You described the exact contents of my purse.
<s> Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
<s> You're not the only one.
<s> Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
<s> First the pets, Otis.
<s> Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
<s> The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
<s> A night on the town instead of under it?
<s> Folks'll ask question.
<s> Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
<s> What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
<s> But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
<s> A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
<s> You've got me? Who's got you???
<s> Sure.
<s> Very much.
<s> Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
<s> It is for me.
<s> Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
<s> Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
<s> --  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
<s> And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
<s> Which one?
<s> That's where I'm going.  To see her.
<s> I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
<s> Alison.
<s> Mister, I don't want to know your name.
<s> Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
<s> Billy, please.  The children.
<s> It does concern me.
<s> Why not?
<s> Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
<s> No.  It should be dry by now.
<s> Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
<s> You talked about it?
<s> Were his parents...attentive to him?
<s> You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
<s> Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
<s> Why would he be frightened?
<s> Hi, Dolores.
<s> I didn't say that.
<s> Summer's over.  It's fall.
<s> I feel like a princess.
<s> Did he say what about?
<s> Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
<s> So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
<s> Why are you calling me, Zoe?
<s> I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
<s> Daddy?
<s> Yes.
<s> You can't come here.
<s> Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
<s> Any criminal record?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
<s> Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
<s> Don't even try to remember.
<s> Oh.  I better get some spackle.
<s> You and Mom have a lawyer?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> The Ottos.
<s> See my mother?
<s> Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
<s> No, I wouldn't...
<s> Why, has he bothered you before?
<s> No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
<s> Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
<s> Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
<s> Did Sidney tell you about it?
<s> But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
<s> I'm taking up the situation with you now...
<s> Now don't kid a kidder.
<s> Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
<s> Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
<s> Not "we", Sidney, you!
<s> What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
<s> When?
<s> Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
<s> I read your column every day...
<s> With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
<s> Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
<s> Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
<s> How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
<s> Talk to her yourself...
<s> He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
<s> Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
<s> Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
<s> No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
<s> Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
<s> One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
<s> I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
<s> Nothing I didn't think of you before.
<s> It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
<s> But what?
<s> The renting agent and the tailor.
<s> Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
<s> I'm used to you...
<s> Take a top coat.
<s> That's no way to talk...
<s> Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
<s> Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
<s> Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
<s> - and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
<s> ...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
<s> That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
<s> And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
<s> Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
<s> No one must follow your work.
<s> I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
<s> You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
<s> Max.
<s> It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
<s> Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
<s> Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
<s> No problemo.
<s> She intends to change the future somehow.
<s> I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
<s> Where'd you learn all this stuff?
<s> Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
<s> Ready.
<s> Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
<s> You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
<s> Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
<s> Unknown.
<s> Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
<s> Why him?
<s> Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
<s> Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
<s> I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
<s> On all what?
<s> And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
<s> Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
<s> I guess it's possible.
<s> I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
<s> Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
<s> There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
<s> But... he only wrote nine, Major.
<s> No. Ours was damaged.
<s> I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
<s> I don't buy that.
<s> I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
<s> When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
<s> It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
<s> They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
<s> Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
<s> Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
<s> I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
<s> This is absolute nonsense!
<s> Show you?
<s> Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
<s> No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
<s> Never heard of him, who is he?
<s> Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
<s> He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
<s> You're late.
<s> That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
<s> No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
<s> One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
<s> Right.
<s> Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
<s> The what?
<s> Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
<s> Okay.  Talk some more.
<s> Molecular-memory.
<s> Fuck you!  Let go of me!
<s> Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
<s> Someone?
<s> Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Who is in authority here?
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
<s> You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
<s> I just called.
<s> You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
<s> Now, look...
<s> What are you babbling about, psycho?
<s> Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
<s> I don't think he's breathing.
<s> Don't just stand there, get help!
<s> He's turning blue!
<s> You should be.
<s> It's not like anyone could actually open it.
<s> What's C.R.S.?
<s> You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
<s> Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
<s> Why... ?
<s> I don't...
<s> What are you talking about... ?
<s> Where'd you get that gun?
<s> Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
<s> Shut up!
<s> That's not true...
<s> No...
<s> Where are you going in such a hurry?
<s> How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
<s> No.
<s> C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
<s> Stop this.  It's not true...
<s> This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
<s> I'll call.  I really will.
<s> An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
<s> Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
<s> No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
<s> Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
<s> Have a nice day.
<s> There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
<s> Your brother.  Will you come with me?
<s> Look, where is he?!
<s> No.
<s> Why are you following me?
<s> Don't ask.
<s> I did okay.
<s> You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
<s> Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
<s> But there's a sad catch to the story.
<s> Yes.
<s> It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
<s> There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
<s> How could you do this to people?
<s> No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
<s> She was unhappy.
<s> Why would we --
<s> I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
<s> Yes.  I've missed it.
<s> There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
<s> Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
<s> I don't think I want any.
<s> Well, you're certainly not a person.
<s> No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
<s> Who?
<s> Sure.
<s> Not bad.
<s> This is un-fucking professional.
<s> Been to the Boat Show.
<s> Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
<s> No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
<s> Y'what?
<s> This ain't your lot?
<s> Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
<s> And that's where you met Jenny.
<s> See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
<s> Faith.
<s> Really.
<s> It's been a while.
<s> Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
<s> Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
<s> She never told Eddie, though.
<s> In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
<s> Footloose and fancy free.
<s> Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
<s> She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
<s> Get seven years, did you?
<s> I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
<s> He alive to see this?
<s> Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
<s> How do you know?
<s> My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
<s> No kidding.
<s> But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
<s> Sounds like you need a rest.
<s> And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
<s> Any happier than any other asshole in life.
<s> Something's on.
<s> Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
<s> Since when?
<s> They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
<s> No trouble.
<s> A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
<s> Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
<s> Geez, Mr Crane.
<s> Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
<s> Look, uh... Creighton...
<s> What is it, Dave?
<s> The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
<s> Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
<s> But it's...
<s> Big Dave--
<s> Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
<s> You don't have to tell me anything.
<s> Sure you don't need one?
<s> So--
<s> Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
<s> He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
<s> Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
<s> I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
<s> The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
<s> I appreciate that.
<s> You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
<s> We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
<s> Calm down.  I found it!
<s> Like hell!
<s> Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
<s> What's left of it.
<s> Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
<s> Call me Vince.
<s> Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
<s> You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
<s> We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
<s> How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
<s> My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
<s> It's like ringing the dinner bell.
<s> No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<s> Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
<s> And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
<s> Read it out loud.
<s> I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
<s> Big as a house.
<s> Like this.
<s> Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
<s> Another storage room.
<s> Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
<s> It's reptilian.
<s> So what?
<s> Eats them?
<s> Okay.
<s> You loved him.
<s> You were afraid of him, weren't you?
<s> I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
<s> No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
<s> I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
<s> How?
<s> It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
<s> I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<s> <i>Fiji.</i>
<s> That's right.
<s> It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
<s> He gave it back to his father.
<s> Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
<s> Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
<s> I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<s> I'm the creator.
<s> It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
<s> Now.
<s> Yeah?  Outta what?
<s> So when are you leaving?
<s> Nursery?
<s> Yeah, what happened?
<s> Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
<s> It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm sorry, I'm late.
<s> There's been an accident, Truman.
<s> You're the one talking to the walls!
<s> Oh, just so.
<s> I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
<s> Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
<s> Fine.  I'll tell her.
<s> Were you there--how do you know?
<s> What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
<s> Yes. I know.
<s> Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
<s> The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
<s> We have a situation. The members are assembling.
<s> Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
<s> There are complications.
<s> Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
<s> Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
<s> I know the name. Why?
<s> And one little boy.
<s> They want to discredit you -- for what?
<s> Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
<s> It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
<s> What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
<s> I told you -- he and I were old friends --
<s> Nice try, Mulder.
<s> There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
<s> You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
<s> Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
<s> About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
<s> Mulder --
<s> Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
<s> Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
<s> You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
<s> I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
<s> -- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
<s> A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
<s> No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
<s> The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
<s> What alien environment?
<s> I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
<s> We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
<s> You need not kill a man to destroy him.
<s> As far as I needed.
<s> The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
<s> Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
<s> I did, yeah.
<s> Then what is he?
<s> You're sure of that?
<s> Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
<s> Yep.  Eloped.
<s> He's beautiful...
<s> "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
<s> Absolutely.
<s> It's his dog.
<s> Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
<s> What else do we do?!
<s> I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
<s> They're forged.
<s> Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
<s> Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
<s> I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
<s> Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
<s> I saw him today.
<s> Oh, the usual things...
<s> Of course.
<s> There's nothing in them.
<s> Two weeks ago.
<s> What did you say? I'm sorry...
<s> I was a friend of Harry Lime.
<s> Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
<s> Fellow called Lime.
<s> Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
<s> Once in a while.
<s> I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
<s> Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
<s> I see.
<s> Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
<s> All right, Calloway. You win.
<s> I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
<s> I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
<s> No, no. Leave them for a while.
<s> I'll look it up for you.
<s> Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
<s> I know a very good dentist.
<s> I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
<s> I told the police.
<s> You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
<s> What's the name of this girl?
<s> How do you do.
<s> Who?
<s> You saw it?
<s> Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
<s> Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay.
<s> Help you out?
<s> Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
<s> Why?
<s> What!
<s> It's on an island that no one get to.
<s> One night I will get the perfect photograph.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
<s> I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
<s> Fire...
<s> Why the fuck not?
<s> I don't care about money.
<s> "And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
<s> You can't.
<s> What do you care?
<s> Why not?
<s> I told you, I'm good at this.
<s> You gotta get out of here.
<s> Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
<s> Did you see how they reacted to him?
<s> It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
<s> They're liars and cowards.
<s> It's the truth....
<s> In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
<s> What??!?
<s> What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
<s> Of course they're Jews.
<s> Are all Jews the same?
<s> You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
<s> Get the fuck away from me.
<s> The arguments, anyway.
<s> You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
<s> With the shoes... There was more than one?
<s> But I wasn't.
<s> You do it on the inside....
<s> Daniel Balint.
<s> I was going to ask you the same thing.
<s> Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
<s> Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
<s> That's meat.
<s> No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
<s> A Jewish prayer.
<s> What...?
<s> I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
<s> No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
<s> No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
<s> Why me?
<s> The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
<s> Do I give a shit?
<s> Funny?
<s> Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
<s> They're not that Jewish.
<s> What kind?
<s> Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
<s> Hello!
<s> Congratulations.
<s> What was he like, when he was little?
<s> Italy!
<s> You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
<s> Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
<s> You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
<s> A rosary for Mama, a dress for
<s> Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
<s> Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
<s> No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
<s> Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
<s> You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
<s> So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
<s> You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
<s> ... The way she moves.
<s> No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
<s> ... Are you sure?
<s> What?
<s> His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
<s> Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
<s> Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
<s> One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
<s> What's up?
<s> Sure. Why not.
<s> Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
<s> Oh. Okay.
<s> No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
<s> Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
<s> You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
<s> No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
<s> What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
<s> Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
<s> Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
<s> I sleep it off.
<s> But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
<s> Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
<s> Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
<s> Where? Where did you find it?
<s> Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
<s> Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
<s> Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
<s> You're worrying about its killing someone else?
<s> It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
<s> That was a calamity!
<s> Thanks, Sheriff.
<s> Why?
<s> You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
<s> Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
<s> Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
<s> I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
<s> Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
<s> And not a sign of the leopard?
<s> Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
<s> Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
<s> Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
<s> We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
<s> Must it?
<s> Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
<s> You a tourist?
<s> Will you please come with me?
<s> That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
<s> Can it be that you want your brother found?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Perhaps I should come back when youre...
<s> Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
<s> You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
<s> You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> Have you got a pen?
<s> The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
<s> Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
<s> Paul Lamont...?
<s> Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
<s> Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
<s> Sorry?
<s> Leon hung himself...
<s> If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
<s> Something like that.
<s> Here we go again.
<s> I dont know. Everyones dead...
<s> Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
<s> A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
<s> No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
<s> I know where to look.
<s> A criminal?
<s> Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.
<s> Shell be alright. Shes tough...
<s> Have we done business before?
<s> May I have your phone number?
<s> What about an untrained pup, white...
<s> Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
<s> I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
<s> I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, youve got to get me out of here...
<s> I certainly did, sir...
<s> Good.
<s> Should I?
<s> Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
<s> Its not.
<s> I hope its not too significant.
<s> Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
<s> Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
<s> You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
<s> Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
<s> Does it matter?
<s> Three oclock.
<s> Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
<s> The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
<s> Er... Yes...
<s> ... No.
<s> Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
<s> Tu sais o me trouver.
<s> Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
<s> The acid bath?
<s> Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
<s> Shut up and walk...
<s> Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
<s> Louis... water and fresh straw!
<s> Now?
<s> How dare you stop me doing God's will!
<s> But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
<s> Yes...
<s> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
<s> But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
<s> But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
<s> To marry you.
<s> Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
<s> If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
<s> But... why... what's the point?
<s> Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
<s> You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
<s> Sound the retreat...
<s> I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
<s> I don't remember.  Maybe.
<s> And so I... I prefer my banner.
<s> Where... where am I?
<s> And God who allowed you to be caught?
<s> I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
<s> Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
<s> And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
<s> Praying.
<s> Yes.
<s> You have nothing to regret...
<s> Silence her!  Take her away...!
<s> It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
<s> Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
<s> He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
<s> Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
<s> What difference does it make where she comes from?
<s> No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
<s> His face.
<s> Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
<s> You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
<s> Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
<s> Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
<s> As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
<s> Perfectly.
<s> No... not like this...
<s> The clothes are not important...
<s> No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
<s> If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
<s> They're going to come and visit you in here?
<s> Oh no?  How about this one?
<s> I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
<s> Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
<s> And what does he say to you?
<s> Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
<s> Jeanne, be patient.
<s> A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
<s> Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
<s> You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
<s> He'll be back before curfew.
<s> Just over a year.
<s> Who told you?
<s> What d'you mean, take the table away?
<s> I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
<s> Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
<s> 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
<s> You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
<s> Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
<s> Bitch!
<s> I was listening, Kitten.
<s> Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
<s> If you need help...
<s> It's a little cut, nothing.
<s> Stop it, Wladek.
<s> No, I don't think so?
<s> I was... I was trying to open this tin.
<s> I am... I was a pianist.
<s> I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
<s> It will be very dramatic.
<s> Yes, like a cave.
<s> ... without a shred of manners.
<s> Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
<s> The Alps.
<s> She's stunted, that's one thing.
<s> On your property?
<s> Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
<s> No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
<s> It was more to your wife that I gave it.
<s> No, not words.
<s> What happened?
<s> Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
<s> Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
<s> At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
<s> No.
<s> Don't worry about it, pal.
<s> But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
<s> If that's the way you want it.
<s> He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
<s> I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
<s> All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
<s> Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
<s> You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
<s> You know anything about him?
<s> If we ever get to it.
<s> What do ya mean?
<s> Just a little nervous, that's all.
<s> Then why you doin' it?
<s> Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
<s> He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
<s> That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
<s> Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
<s> Don't have much choice, do ya?
<s> What for?  I haven't done anything.
<s> Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
<s> What the hell for?
<s> This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
<s> He's right, Les.
<s> Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
<s> We missed him.
<s> There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
<s> What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
<s> Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
<s> Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
<s> But tonight is Christmas Eve!
<s> Another young man.
<s> You've got to get your mind off this.
<s> I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
<s> And I'll give then proof!
<s> Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
<s> Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
<s> Disappeared!
<s> Where did you hit her?
<s> He's been dead for three months.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> It's a promise?
<s> And he still wants to marry me!
<s> No.
<s> You mean about that gun?
<s> Man to man, I'm not.
<s> It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
<s> Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
<s> Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
<s> Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
<s> No.
<s> You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
<s> Oh, then you did hear from him?
<s> When was that?
<s> I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
<s> A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
<s> I guess all the suspects are here.
<s> How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
<s> Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
<s> Just what I said I'd do.
<s> You're going to return every cent of it!
<s> What did you do with the rest?
<s> That's all right.
<s> So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
<s> I trust you.
<s> No.
<s> Is Julia going with you?
<s> What do you think?
<s> I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
<s> Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
<s> They'll want more than your word for that.
<s> What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
<s> You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
<s> Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
<s> I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
<s> He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
<s> Much better, thanks.
<s> That last Martini.
<s> Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
<s> Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
<s> Breakfast.
<s> He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Yes.
<s> Say you're the one who got me in this!
<s> Not with all your money!
<s> My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
<s> Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
<s> Couple of months anyway.
<s> No.  Nobody but you.
<s> I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
<s> Mimi...
<s> That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
<s> Police!
<s> You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
<s> I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
<s> You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
<s> I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
<s> Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
<s> He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
<s> I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
<s> Move!
<s> I've got no stomach for murder.
<s> And let me guess who is.
<s> Suppose I don't go for that?
<s> Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
<s> Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
<s> If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
<s> There might be something in there.
<s> There might be.
<s> Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
<s> Wh-what do you think--
<s> We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
<s> I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
<s> I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
<s> We leave it.
<s> I got that...sir.
<s> Me and Wes are just going to talk.
<s> You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
<s> Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
<s> It's the treasure, that's what it is.
<s> What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
<s> The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
<s> Stay low.
<s> We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
<s> Is it dead?
<s> I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
<s> We'll lie.
<s> I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
<s> You sure you want me too?
<s> It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
<s> Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
<s> They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
<s> Naw, nothing.
<s> This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
<s> It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
<s> It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
<s> How the hell should I know how much?
<s> You know what I'm doing with my half?
<s> We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
<s> I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
<s> No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
<s> I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
<s> Now.
<s> It's 3+27 hundred
<s> What?
<s> But...you...
<s> AH UGH.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
<s> Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
<s> We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
<s> I don't feel well.
<s> What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
<s> Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
<s> I thought of something.....
<s> I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
<s> You should know better than that!
<s> Officer Reilly, vice.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No thanks, Bev.
<s> When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
<s> She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
<s> Where...?
<s> Hey, look--
<s> What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
<s> Your partner?
<s> Me, too.
<s> Right.
<s> Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
<s> It's from an IRA.
<s> "Punks", huh?
<s> Reilly! He's loaded!
<s> People are dying.
<s> Nothing... just tired.
<s> Shut up!  Who is this?
<s> Maybe she knows your old man.
<s> Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
<s> We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
<s> Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
<s> Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
<s> It's about this.
<s> What?
<s> Huh?
<s> You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
<s> Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
<s> She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
<s> We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
<s> At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
<s> Yes, M'sieu Laval?
<s> Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
<s> Where did you find it?
<s> I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
<s> Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
<s> So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
<s> The type they marry.
<s> Just dull.
<s> If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
<s> Yes, Baron.
<s> But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
<s> Just a second.
<s> Otherwise I'll call the police
<s> I know it!
<s> Just as you say, Doctor.
<s> Why should you?
<s> You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
<s> Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
<s> What?
<s> Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
<s> Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
<s> Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
<s> Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
<s> Ye-es?
<s> And so will M'sieu Giron.
<s> Together.
<s> Hair?
<s> You would?
<s> Like that?
<s> So you think you can get me?
<s> I <u>believe</u> you.
<s> Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
<s> Yes, Madame Colet?
<s> I know!
<s> Well--uh--yes and no.
<s> Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
<s> Well, he was in the navy.
<s> Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
<s> I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
<s> Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
<s> So do I.
<s> It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
<s> Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
<s> Not the better half.
<s> I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
<s> What do I tell your mother?
<s> What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
<s> You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
<s> I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
<s> No, but we're making excellent time.
<s> Well, here you are.
<s> If only it were that simple.
<s> Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
<s> You wouldn'ta jumped.
<s> Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
<s> Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
<s> You're still my best girl, Cora.
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> We'll find out.
<s> Get in the boat, Rose.
<s> Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
<s> Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
<s> You had it the entire time?!
<s> Charmed, I'm sure.
<s> This is Miss Marsh.
<s> I'll join you later.
<s> Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
<s> --and I can tell you where to get off.
<s> Will you leave me alone?
<s> That's a date. 
<s> We'll save you a place at our table.
<s> Sorry I can't return the compliment.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Montana?
<s> Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<s> I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
<s> I'll bet a couple of hundred.
<s> Yes--
<s> No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
<s> --sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
<s> Brett is the name.
<s> At seven-thirty?
<s> Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
<s> What do you know about them?
<s> Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
<s> Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
<s> She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
<s> Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
<s> It's a pleasure.
<s> Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
<s> Why, I--
<s> Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
<s> I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
<s> Wait a minute--let's match for it.
<s> What's that?
<s> O.K.! Send that!
<s> It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
<s> It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
<s> Yeah--
<s> I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
<s> But not nice enough to marry--eh?
<s> <U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
<s> I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
<s> Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
<s> So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
<s> Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
<s> Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
<s> Good-night, folks.
<s> Eh?... Oh.
<s> That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
<s> You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
<s> Why?
<s> Telegrams.
<s> Let me look at it.
<s> Maybe even my destiny.
<s> Absolutely nothing.
<s> Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
<s> Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
<s> And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
<s> Well... 'bye.
<s> But wait, you don't understand-
<s> Yeah, you look it.
<s> Here it come: one-two-
<s> I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
<s> How you feelin', Doc?
<s> All right, Doc...
<s> You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
<s> What was that all about?
<s> I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
<s> Fortuitous even.
<s> Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
<s> They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
<s> Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
<s> Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
<s> I know.  And nobody can make him.
<s> Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
<s> I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
<s> Doc's just in no kinda shape.
<s> Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
<s> Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
<s> No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
<s> Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
<s> You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
<s> We'll see about that.
<s> They're merely tools to disseminate information.
<s> Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
<s> Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
<s> My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
<s> Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
<s> I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
<s> Is this another one of your games?
<s> No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
<s> Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
<s> Political considerations?
<s> Well... If you insist.
<s> I see...
<s> Hey - the world is my office.
<s> Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
<s> Hell. The CIA built that club.
<s> That's reassuring.
<s> I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
<s> This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
<s> No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
<s> So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
<s> Think about mom.
<s> - The family jewels?
<s> No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
<s> You are seriously deranged.
<s> Next time, I do the driving.
<s> Hopefully, it won't get that far.
<s> Sabotage?
<s> Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
<s> I see you two have met.
<s> Excellent.
<s> Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
<s> You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
<s> Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
<s> Maybe I can get down there next week.
<s> My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
<s> I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
<s> Will you still get the money from your father?
<s> This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
<s> What for?
<s> Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
<s> Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
<s> You all act like two roosters.
<s> Babe Brother is a poor boy.
<s> I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
<s> You stay inside. I will see to them.
<s> You must have been really sick.
<s> Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
<s> I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
<s> You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
<s> Let me get you a cup?
<s> Hattie is a different person now.
<s> I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
<s> Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
<s> Girl, do you still sing and dance?
<s> Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
<s> I thought you weren't old fashioned.
<s> If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
<s> I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
<s> Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
<s> Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
<s> I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
<s> Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
<s> Okay...
<s> What?  What is it?
<s> Rocky!  The ramp!
<s> Excuse me.
<s> You can't!
<s> Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
<s> That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
<s> You're mocking me, aren't you?
<s> Where?
<s> That's why.  Sid.
<s> You mean that happy child?
<s> Then we've no time to lose!!
<s> Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
<s> Sorry.
<s> Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
<s> Shield your eyes!
<s> One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
<s> But why would Andy want me?
<s> Woody!  The rocket!
<s> You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
<s> We're not aiming for the truck!
<s> Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
<s> So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
<s> Did I get my package in the mail?
<s> I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
<s> Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
<s> Will you quit moving around?!
<s> How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
<s> All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
<s> Alright!  That's it!
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hey look!  It's Buzz!
<s> Oh, I don't like confrontations.
<s> He got it, Woody!
<s> Yes SIR!
<s> Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
<s> Got it.
<s> See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
<s> Slink!  Hang on!
<s> She'll have to learn.
<s> Is that all?
<s> Well, I hope it stays that way.
<s> He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
<s> He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
<s> Arnie, this is crazy.
<s> Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
<s> I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
<s> I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
<s> What?
<s> Carl --
<s> Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
<s> Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Somehow, I don't see that happening.
<s> Cincinnati Country Day.
<s> She ain't in on it.
<s> Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
<s> When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
<s> I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
<s> They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
<s> She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
<s> The police won't find your car.
<s> Your new friends.
<s> We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
<s> It's possible.
<s> If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
<s> Any way we can do it better?
<s> I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
<s> You won't say anything to my parents?
<s> We sometimes went downtown to score.
<s> I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
<s> Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
<s> Can you not go yourself.
<s> I'm going home.
<s> What?
<s> No, not holding hands.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> It's Iggy Pop.
<s> Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
<s> So why have you told me about it?
<s> I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
<s> Oh, really?
<s> Of course, the motto, the motto --
<s> The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
<s> Aye.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And you might get the fucking job.
<s> OK, so who was it, then?
<s> Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
<s> OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
<s> What about The Untouchables?
<s> I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
<s> It wasn't that bad.
<s> No, he didn't make me touch it.
<s> And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
<s> You're all hear.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
<s> Four Grand.
<s> Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
<s> Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
<s> As you wish.
<s> It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
<s> Such as?
<s> No joy yet.
<s> But where?
<s> And how did you breach the Barrier?
<s> He doubts me.
<s> I don't have a clue.
<s> Have the Klingons responded?
<s> What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
<s> I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
<s> Why didn't you beep my communicator?
<s> Because it's there.
<s> MM.?
<s> Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
<s> Goodnight, Bones.
<s> Goodnight, Doctor.
<s> Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
<s> Yes, Captain?
<s> If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
<s> The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
<s> But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
<s> The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
<s> If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
<s> Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
<s> I'll take you to the bridge.
<s> You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
<s> I'm afraid of nothing.
<s> I hide no pain.
<s> I belong here.
<s> "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
<s> I know, I met him.
<s> Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
<s> Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
<s> I'm sorry -
<s> You wouldn't dare.
<s> Yeah, I... oops!
<s> I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
<s> Yes.
<s> PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
<s> Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
<s> He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
<s> That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
<s> Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
<s> Why is everything...like this?
<s> Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
<s> Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
<s> Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
<s> Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
<s> Fine.
<s> Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
<s> Yes.
<s> This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
<s> I thought you moved out.
<s> In her dreams.
<s> I still don't believe it.
<s> Yeah, but for who?							*
<s> You didn't have sexual relations with him?
<s> There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
<s> But you didn't.  Why not?
<s> But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
<s> Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
<s> Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
<s> Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
<s> I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
<s> Yeah.  I suppose he is.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you still love your husband?
<s> Louder please.
<s> Sure, hon.
<s> Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
<s> Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
<s> No.  Much more.
<s> What about the husbands?
<s> Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
<s> No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't.
<s> It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
<s> I don't know.  I have to think...
<s> Helen.
<s> Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
<s> His wife.
<s> How come?
<s> And here we are.
<s> Want some Goobers?
<s> How 'bout me what?
<s> Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
<s> What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
<s> I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
<s> You're not stupid. Just wrong.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
<s> Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
<s> You will?
<s> How do you do, Mr. Worley?
<s> What?
<s> You don't know him -
<s> How come?
<s> Cancoon.
<s> That rhymes.
<s> I heard that.
<s> Heard that.
<s> Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
<s> Has he gotten his mail today?
<s> Did you meet Captain Kirk?
<s> I certainly hope so.
<s> He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
<s> Where?
<s> No shit? Dick, that's great!
<s> Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
<s> In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
<s> Yeah, let's just get outta here.
<s> No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
<s> - that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
<s> The police department?
<s> He trusts you?
<s> Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
<s> We grew up together.
<s> You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
<s> Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
<s> That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
<s> I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
<s> No.
<s> It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
<s> I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
<s> But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
<s> Rock whores.
<s> I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
<s> - Because it's good!
<s> Do you know a Clarence Worley?
<s> Donowitz, he said.
<s> Uh, what?
<s> Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
<s> You're still a little... disoriented.
<s> It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
<s> So that...???
<s> I need to go now.
<s> You wouldn't understand.
<s> Underground.
<s> 1995?
<s> You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
<s> "If something really happens"...like what, James?
<s> Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
<s> Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
<s> James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
<s> A Carpet Cleaning Company?
<s> If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
<s> Well, you look pretty different, too.
<s> In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
<s> Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
<s> Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
<s> I'm here about some monkeys.
<s> Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
<s> Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
<s> I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
<s> Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
<s> Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
<s> Hey, man...
<s> Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
<s> Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
<s> I got more brains than you've got teeth.
<s> Out of here.
<s> I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
<s> Time.
<s> Twenty-after-ten.
<s> Don't look like nothing.
<s> I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
<s> What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
<s> Yeah, you better remember that.
<s> Open up!
<s> Genuine Draft?
<s> John . . .
<s> Sheriff Potter.
<s> Wrong number.
<s> The wind isn't blowing.
<s> My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
<s> Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
<s> I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
<s> I just drove in this morning.
<s> Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
<s> Still playing?
<s> If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
<s> I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
<s> You just walk away.
<s> I can't.
<s> Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
<s> Where?
<s> I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
<s> If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
<s> Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
<s> You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> He was going to--
<s> But you said we could be together.
<s> Grace!
<s> I'll get it.
<s> Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
<s> I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
<s> Wait a second--
<s> That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> How do you know if you've never tried?
<s> I had a problem getting my car back.
<s> About what you said this morning.
<s> The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
<s> Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
<s> And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
<s> Darrell giving you problems?
<s> Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
<s> Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
<s> Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
<s> Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
<s> I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
<s> Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
<s> I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
<s> You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
<s> Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
<s> And you're taking?
<s> Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
<s> You can't do that yourself?
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't--
<s> Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
<s> Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
<s> You afraid of the dark?
<s> Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
<s> You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
<s> Give it to me!
<s> Who the hell are you?
<s> Yeah, I know.  More careful.
<s> That's a solid name.
<s> That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
<s> I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
<s> Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
<s> You came to take my wife from me?
<s> Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
<s> That country shit all sounds the same to me.
<s> Cause she's dead.
<s> You're too quick for me.
<s> I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
<s> Will you shut up!
<s> Nope.  Darrell.
<s> So?
<s> It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
<s> Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
<s> You believe that?
<s> Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
<s> You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
<s> No.
<s> Eh?
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
<s> I guess it must.
<s> It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
<s> No.
<s> Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.
<s> You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
<s> You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
<s> Stop it.
<s> It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
<s> You could give me my gun back.
<s> My mother died in this canyon.
<s> And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
<s> Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
<s> No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
<s> No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
<s> Sure, I'll try.
<s> No baby, you got it wrong.
<s> Like you helped her, Jake?
<s> I said come on!
<s> Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
<s> You've made a considerably wise decision.
<s> My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
<s> I'll keep it in my office room.
<s> I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
<s> Yes.
<s> No that's it.
<s> Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
<s> My turn. What's your favorite song?
<s> I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
<s> The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
<s> Like what?
<s> Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
<s> I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
<s> Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
<s> Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
<s> I'll help you.
<s> Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
<s> ...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
<s> I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
<s> Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
<s> Thank God.
<s> What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
<s> Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
<s> 'Course he's coming.
<s> Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
<s> Your wife?
<s> Those cowboys messin' him up?
<s> Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
<s> Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
<s> Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
<s> You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
<s> I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
<s> I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
<s> And?
<s> Give it to him.
<s> Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
<s> Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh.
<s> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
<s> He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
<s> He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
<s> You missed him? You didn't...?
<s> Tell me right off if you see him.
<s> Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
<s> You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
<s> You ain't like that no more.
<s> Whaddaya do, just use your hand?
<s> Beats the hell out of me.
<s> What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
<s> I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
<s> Huh? Uh... yeah.
<s> He's dead, Bill.
<s> Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
<s> Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
<s> I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
<s> Two more hogs got the fever.
<s> I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
<s> I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
<s> Move the candle closer, I can't see.
<s> We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
<s> We'll bury him.
<s> He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
<s> No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
<s> He says the hair is longer and lighter.
<s> Just forget about it.
<s> They'll never stop.
<s> They ruined me tonight.
<s> Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
<s> County. I was in for fraud.
<s> I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
<s> Well, I'm sorry.
<s> McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
<s> Maybe more.
<s> Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
<s> We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
<s> A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
<s> We want to meet him.
<s> Tell him we'll meet.
<s> Two hours, tops.
<s> Someplace else, then.
<s> If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
<s> Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
<s> I told the D.A. everything I know.
<s> You know a religious guy named John Paul?
<s> He didn't have my lawyer.
<s> I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
<s> You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
<s> The D.A. gave me immunity.
<s> McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
<s> Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> Because he was my friend.
<s> He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
<s> Why lie about everything else, then?
<s> You think he's..?
<s> Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
<s> Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
<s> That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
<s> Mickey told me to come back to work.
<s> It looks that way.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
<s> Well, we...
<s> ...We did everything we could...
<s> ...to get her heartbeat back...?
<s> What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
<s> I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> The Doctors were not negligent.
<s> No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> My client can't walk, your Honor.
<s> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
<s> No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
<s> I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
<s> Let me talk to Mickey.
<s> Kathy Price.
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> Yes.
<s> Who told you that?
<s> And what makes you so tough?
<s> It's over!
<s> He's not in, Sir.
<s> Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
<s> They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
<s> You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
<s> I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
<s> Oh shit, what's today?
<s> I can't talk now.
<s> Read me what she said.
<s> All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
<s> What did she do?
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's for sure, Frank.
<s> We, we were rather busy...
<s> Huh.
<s> No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
<s> Then?
<s> No.
<s> More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
<s> Have you talked to the doctors at all?
<s> It's not my line.
<s> Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
<s> I -- I --
<s> Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
<s> What for? Who are you?
<s> I want to know who you are.
<s> Okay.
<s> Judy --
<s> I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
<s> Oh, yeah. There.
<s> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<s> To complete my cure.
<s> Scottie --
<s> Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
<s> Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
<s> No...
<s> Why?
<s> I... didn't know where you lived.
<s> Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
<s> My name is John Ferguson.
<s> Some people prefer it.
<s> Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
<s> Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
<s> Here with you.
<s> No!
<s> What?!
<s> Home?
<s> It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
<s> No, never!
<s> No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
<s> Let me go.
<s> It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
<s> What is her name?
<s> No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
<s> What's tomorrow?
<s> Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
<s> You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
<s> How?
<s> Do you know him well?
<s> And she died...
<s> And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
<s> Bye-bye!
<s> Wandering.
<s> Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
<s> You're interrupting a personal conversation.
<s> Franco mother-fucking Harris!
<s> They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
<s> What?
<s> There's more.
<s> So I didn't fucking do it!
<s> We've already done this.
<s> No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
<s> I don't give a damn.
<s> I know and I'm honored...
<s> Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
<s> Sweet deal.
<s> Fish?
<s> That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
<s> Left side.
<s> What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
<s> Good God...Good God...
<s> I think we should say some words over the grave.
<s> What is the question you asked me?
<s> You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
<s> Fine? Fine what?
<s> Moore?
<s> You hate women.
<s> True.
<s> And what happens when you can't?
<s> They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
<s> Not really, no.
<s> Why what?
<s> He's a moron.
<s> I've known him since Cub Scouts.
<s> So what do we do?
<s> More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
<s> I will.
<s> I love you.
<s> Hey. It's me.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Are they fighting?
<s> Yeah. You.
<s> No.
<s> But...
<s> Like how?
<s> How do you know she's dead.
<s> That's what I'm thinking.
<s> Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
<s> Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
<s> Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
<s> Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
<s> What's that?
<s> What about them?
<s> Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
<s> No.
<s> Don't you ever see him?
<s> Thank you, Uncle.
<s> Today I can refuse you nothing.
<s> Wasn't that cowardice?
<s> Yes, sir. Good night.
<s> I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
<s> Nothing.
<s> No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
<s> But you have a right to let us know what you think.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
<s> When you are, miss.
<s> Today, a good girl.
<s> Yes, yes, I saw you!
<s> I don't know.
<s> Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
<s> Their weapons missing?
<s> Then I guess we're even.
<s> Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
<s> You think he's smart?
<s> Got it.
<s> The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
<s> Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
<s> I'm still making adjustments...
<s> Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
<s> What's wrong with Parker?
<s> Show me his physical sensory level.
<s> No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
<s> What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
<s> It wasn't a lie.
<s> Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
<s> As a matter of fact, it is.
<s> In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
<s> Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
<s> Enjoying yourself?
<s> Both.
<s> DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
<s> My...secret.
<s> Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
<s> When you...  What?  I'm busy.
<s> They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
<s> Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
<s> Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
<s> He's not fine.
<s> But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
<s> Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
<s> Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
<s> Who's gonna tell'em.
<s> <u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
<s> What did Albania ever do to us?
<s> It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
<s> The Hostages...?
<s> A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
<s> Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<s> ...Stanley Moss...
<s> ...fourteen years...
<s> The War is Over.
<s> No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
<s> Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
<s> Could we have you in here, please...7
<s> I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
<s> Quite touching.
<s> Heavy weather East of here.
<s> Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
<s> I have.
<s> Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
<s> Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
<s> And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
<s> It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
<s> I'm sure they do.
<s> In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
<s> Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
<s> They got him standing by.
<s> What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 
<s> S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
<s> Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
<s> What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
<s> Is he dead?
<s> He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
<s> Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
<s> Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
<s> It's a <u>beret</u>...
<s> I believe in you....
<s> I'm just talking about the Hats.
<s> Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
<s> ...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
<s> That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
<s> Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
<s> I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
<s> You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
<s> Yeah, where's your machine gun.
<s> Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
<s> Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
<s> Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
<s> All right, I owe you one Marv.
<s> Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
<s> Then get out and close it behind you.
<s> Get the hell out!
<s> It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
<s> D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
<s> About what?
<s> ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
<s> Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
<s> ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
<s> They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
<s> Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
<s> "What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
<s> Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
<s> All right, Bud... let's do it.

<s> Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
<s> No sir, that would've been illegal...
<s> ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
<s> Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
<s> Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
<s> What? How do you know about my father?
<s> I remember that deal. You were involved?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
<s> Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
<s> Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
<s> Gordon.
<s> Aha. Poet or philosopher?
<s> Upper West Side.
<s> You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
<s> That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
<s> Oh Christ!
<s> Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
<s> There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
<s> It's over you, Gordon.
<s> Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
<s> He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
<s> No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
<s> If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
<s> Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
<s> A body.  I mean we're talking major body
<s> Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
<s> Hmm.
<s> Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
<s> A party at a waxwork huh?
<s> Vell.  Goodnight.
<s> Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
<s> Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
<s> Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
<s> Well divide 18 into three
<s> Hey.
<s> So much.
<s> Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
<s> Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
<s> You're joking.
<s> Do you have any idea who she is?
<s> Have you been hurt?
<s> I know how hard it can be sometimes.
<s> Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
<s> I have to go.
<s> Um...sure.
<s> Please leave me alone.
<s> ...just so she could cut them off.
<s> I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
<s> And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
<s> Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
<s> Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
<s> Like what?
<s> What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Yep.
<s> No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
<s> I know.
<s> I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
<s> No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
<s> I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
<s> What's going on, Claire?
<s> A flare?
<s> It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
<s> Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
<s> Harvey says he's amazing.
<s> You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
<s> Sweetheart--
<s> Yep.
<s> I...
<s> In the living room...
<s> But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
<s> What's wrong with me?
<s> Since when?
<s> Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
<s> STOP IT!
<s> Oh God...
<s> It's alright.
<s> Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
<s> But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
<s> With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
<s> You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
<s> What are you talk---
<s> I don't want it.
<s> Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
<s> This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
<s> You - are - a - murderer.
<s> Now, lasher - it is our time.
<s> Anybody got a BP yet...?
<s> He just went out like & light-
<s> I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
<s> I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
<s> Leave me alone!
<s> Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
<s> Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
<s> Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
<s> Really...?  Your family there...?
<s> Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
<s> Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
<s> Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
<s> God knows, I'm intriguing.
<s> That's GREAT!
<s> Mm-hmm...
<s> Did you see the old man on the ---
<s> Your beneficence.
<s> You bastard!
<s> That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
<s> Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
<s> I'm sorry - I didn't think
<s> Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
<s> CHIC MAGAZINE?
<s> No - I've been abroad for a long time...
<s> Yes - I have had it for years.
<s> I think I will pass...
<s> Where do you kill them...
<s> You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
<s> I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
<s> Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
<s> Nothing could be better...
<s> I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
<s> I am sorry...
<s> Yes - I suppose so...
<s> At 2.00...
<s> I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
<s> I think you had better leave
<s> Oh...
<s> Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
<s> Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
<s> That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
<s> Were you always this sick?
<s> Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
<s> Astronomical.
<s> I better go, Dad.
<s> Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
<s> It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
<s> Take a whiff of heaven.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah?
<s> So that's a maybe?
<s> Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
<s> Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
<s> We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
<s> It's my private business! Mine!
<s> Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
<s> Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
<s> They're in the ignition, silly.
<s> What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> Hang in there, I'll think of something.
<s> Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
<s> Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
<s> You mean they knew who I was?
<s> I understand.
<s> Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
<s> I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
<s> Most places are, Jimmy.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
<s> I'm trying to help.
<s> Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
<s> Interesting.
<s> Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
<s> And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
<s> He phoned it in.
<s> A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
<s> Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
<s> Amen to that.
<s> I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
<s> Wearing them?  Or humping them?
<s> You're quick. I like that.
<s> The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
<s> Yellow pages?
<s> Oh. Goodness.
<s> Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
<s> I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
<s> A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
<s> Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
<s> It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
<s> You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
<s> My job. Back off, Benedict.
<s> Eat a power bar.
<s> I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
<s> We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
<s> What about the blood?
<s> Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
<s> Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
<s> She still work there?
<s> Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
<s> I'm fine.  Nice TV.
<s> I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
<s> He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
<s> You could tell me where you were last night.
<s> Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
<s> Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
<s> You could say that.
<s> I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
<s> You have someplace to be?
<s> Did he come in with you?
<s> Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
<s> Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
<s> Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
<s> Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, but...
<s> I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
<s> You're out of your mind.
<s> Hi, Mon.
<s> I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
<s> Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
<s> Do it to ourselves?
<s> I love you.  Now give me the line.
<s> Will they?
<s> Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
<s> Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
<s> Are you mad at me?
<s> The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
<s> But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
<s> Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
<s> Can't.  Got a passenger.
<s> Jim West.
<s> Funny.  So am I.
<s> Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
<s> Wouldn't dream of it.
<s> Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
<s> Almost?
<s> You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
<s> All what?
<s> At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
<s> "Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
<s> Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
<s> This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
<s> I adjusted it.
<s> You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
<s> He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
<s> But it only has six legs.
<s> We'll see.
<s> I've had some practice.
<s> Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
<s> My friend?
<s> I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
<s> And?
<s> When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
<s> No, sir... just a businessman.
<s> Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
<s> They're coming.
<s> Right.
<s> I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
<s> Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
<s> Let me see it.
<s> Too bad you're not more like your father.
<s> As above, so below.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Friend of yours?
<s> I hate this.
<s> You don't know anything about ba- bies.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
<s> Because she's sick.
<s> What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
<s> Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
<s> No.
<s> That's all I ever wanted!
<s> We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
<s> More!  More!
<s> Surrender!!
<s> Courage, Willow.
<s> Ouch!  Let go of me!
<s> How are we going to get out there?
<s> The sorceress.
<s> Guess I'm not used to so much.
<s> Pretty much.
<s> Pick up the hat.
<s> ...I want to say a thing.
<s> I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
<s> Sure have, Sam.
<s> If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
<s> The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
<s> Who else knows?
<s> Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
<s> Just us.
<s> Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 
<s> Move! Or you die right here!
<s> No.
<s> Home.
<s> Only the elders.
<s> What?
<s> Two days.
<s> Quaint? Can't imagine why.
<s> Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
<s> I'm going this morning.
<s> But... You may not be well enough.
<s> Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
<s> He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
<s> Yes, thank you very much.
<s> You didn't have to...
<s> No...
<s> I know.
<s> I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
<s> Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
<s> You might have killed him!
<s> Oh -- all right.
<s> Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
<s> Yes, darling.
<s> Oh, I hope we got them in time.
<s> Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
<s> Is morally, ethic'ly
<s> The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
<s> Who are you?
<s> Ohhh!
<s> That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
<s> Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
<s> That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
<s> No, I'm afraid I didn't.
<s> You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
<s> Whenever you wish.
<s> Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
<s> My mouth -- my mouth!
<s> Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
<s> Oh --
<s> Lions and tigers and bears!
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
<s> Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
<s> Ohhhh --
<s> Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
<s> Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
<s> Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
<s> Ah --
<s> Somebody pulled my tail.
<s> Fine.  He's got a plan
<s> Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
<s> She - she can have my Witch Remover.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We do.
<s> I'd be clever as a gizzard --
<s> I don't think I could, but we could try.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
<s> Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
<s> We'll get you together!
<s> You put up a great fight, Lion.
<s> Yes -- how about Dorothy?
<s> Well, I --
<s> With this?
<s> When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
<s> If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
<s> Hes going to insert the plutonium.
<s> Renard.
<s> The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
<s> That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
<s> Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
<s> You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
<s> Funerals arent exactly memorable.
<s> Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
<s> Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
<s> Were alright.
<s> I have to go.
<s> You can drop the act, its over.
<s> Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
<s> Where did you get this?
<s> She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
<s> What do you think?
<s> No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
<s> Still no contact yet.
<s> Washington?
<s> Don't call me that.
<s> Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
<s> Hello, Adrian.
<s> Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
<s> Collect me?
<s> Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
<s> Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
<s> Because --
<s> Veidts complex.
<s> Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
<s> And what if youre wrong?
<s> Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
<s> Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
<s> Antarctica??
<s> Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
<s> I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
<s> Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
<s> Those cars.  What year is this??
<s> Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
<s> Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
<s> We should get back --  What?
<s> We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
<s> Janey, will you marry me?
<s> -- What?
<s> What does this mean?  What does it --
<s> Am I free to go?
<s> And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
<s> No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
<s> Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
<s> You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
<s> You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
<s> If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
<s> Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
<s> You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
<s> The scum of the Earth.
<s> I've seen enough. Turn it off.
<s> I think we should send him whatever he wants.
<s> He gets to be the hero.
<s> Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
<s> Yorgi asked me to.
<s> You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
<s> I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
<s> I'm from L.A.
<s> Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
<s> I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
<s> It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
<s> There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
<s> Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
<s> What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
<s> I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
<s> We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
<s> What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
<s> Go to the water, it's that way!
<s> Nice place to start, don't you think?
<s> It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
<s> I'm through, Xander.
<s> I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
<s> You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
<s> Is this what you're looking for?
<s> Been to any good diners lately?
<s> He's a pretty good actor, though.
<s> Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
<s> Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
<s> You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
<s> Beast.
<s> No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
<s> You know, you --
<s> What if I like the pain?
<s> By reading my thoughts?
<s> I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
<s> I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
<s> Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
<s> Let's just say, God works too slowly.
<s> A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
<s> What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
<s> Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
<s> She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
<s> Enough for a test.
<s> Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
<s> Yes, my dear, he is.
<s> Victor Frankenstein.
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Hello...?
<s> I...
<s> You're incorrigible!
<s> You bet your boots it does.
<s> Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
<s> Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
<s> Fron kon steen!
<s> Why did you do that?
<s> Break that old man's violin.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, just the two.
<s> I wonder what's got into them?
<s> 'How I Did It.'  Good title!
<s> Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
<s> All right... elevate me!
<s> It wasn't me.
